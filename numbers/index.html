This is the home page for the presentation
&#8220;Why Free-Libre / Open Source Software (FLOSS or OSS/FS)? Look at the Numbers!&#8221;.
This presentation is a summary of my paper, titled
<a href="http://www.dwheeler.com/oss_fs_why.html">
&#8220;Why Open Source Software / Free Software (OSS/FS or FLOSS)? Look at the Numbers!&#8221;</a>, and its
<a href="http://www.dwheeler.com/numbers-database/">supporting database
on OSS/FS quantitative data</a>.
Both the paper and presentation
provide quantitative data to show that, in many cases,
free-libre / open source software (FLOSS) is equal to or superior
to their proprietary competition.
The goal is not to show they are always superior... just enough to show
you that you should consider them when acquiring software.
Both the paper (with supporting database) and the presentation
examine market share, reliability, performance, scalability,
scaleability, security, and total cost of ownership; they
also both comment on non-quantitative issues and unnecessary fears.
<p>

<a href="http://www.dwheeler.com/numbers-database/">supporting database</a>
or

<a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/numbers-about-free-libre-open-source-software">discussion group for quantitative numbers
about free / libre / open source software</a>.
If you want the short version, in presentation form, you're at the right place!

<h1>Getting the Presentation</h1>
<p>
Just choose the language and format you'd prefer.
For just reading, choose PDF; if you want to modify it (say to include
in your own presentation), choose OpenDocument (and see the license
information below):
<p>

<font size="+2">
<table border="1" cellpadding="2" summary="Presentation formats available">
<tr bgcolor="#bac0ff">
<th>Language</th>
<th>PDF</th>
<th>OpenDocument (.odp)</th>
<th>Date</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<th>English</th>
<td><a href="oss_fs_why_presentation.pdf">PDF (English)</a></td>
<td><a href="oss_fs_why_presentation.odp">OpenDocument (.odp) (English)</a></td>
<td>2011-04-17</td>
</tr>
</table>
</font>

<p>
PDF is Portable Document Format, a read-only format
that can be viewed with Adobe Acrobat, xpdf, evince, and many other viewers.
(Note: evince 0.4.0 has a known printing bug; use an alternative if
you print.)
The PDF has the presentation twice: first, it has the just the presentation
slides (full page); this is followed by the annotated slides.
<p>
OpenDocument format is the only international standard format
for exchanging editable office documents.
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenDocument">Wikipedia's article
on OpenDocument</a> explains OpenDocument further,
if you're not familiar with it yet.
OpenDocument's .odp format is for presentations, and thus
it's like the obsolete .ppt Powerpoint format.
However, OpenDocument is based on XML (with XML's many advantages) and
is an open, public standard that anyone can implement.
If you don't have a program that can read OpenDocument files yet,
one simple solution is to install the freely-available
<a href="http://www.openoffice.org">OpenOffice.org</a> office suite.
There are other FLOSS and proprietary programs
that read the OpenDocument format,
including KOffice, StarOffice, and others (see the Wikipedia article for more).
OpenDocument isn't specific to OSS/FS, but since there are
OSS/FS programs that support it <i>and</i> it's the only international
standard for this purpose, it seemed very appropriate to use it.

<h1>More about the Presentation</h1>
<p>
This presentation is a summary, giving you a quick summary of some of the
most interesting or relevant studies.
In contrast,
<a href="http://www.dwheeler.com/oss_fs_why.html">
see the paper &#8220;Why OSS/FS? Look at the Numbers!&#8221;
if you want to see complete set of studies or more information about
the studies.</a>
That paper is the most complete collection of such statistics
in the world, to my knowledge, and I try to keep it complete.
But because it&#8217;s grown so large, many people would rather have the
&#8220;short form&#8221; of the work.

<!--
So here it is!  Hopefully, if you&#8217;ve been looking for something
shorter and simpler, this will help.  It has many backup slides,
but that&#8217;s all they are... backup.
The presentation includes in the backup material
a summary on how to evaluate OSS/FS.
That material is is derived from
<a href="http://www.dwheeler.com/oss_fs_eval.html">my paper on
evaluating open source software / Free Software (OSS/FS)</a>
-->

<p>
This briefing was given in 2005 in Porto Alegre, Brazil, at the
<a href="http://www.dwheeler.com/essays/fisl2005.html">
6th International Free Software Conference (FISL 6.0)</a>.
I&#8217;ve given various versions of it many other times over the years.

<p>
<h1>Fonts</h1>
<p>

This presentation uses Microsoft&#8217;s True Type core fonts.
<a href="http://avi.alkalay.net/linux/docs/font-howto/Font.html">As noted
in this font HOWTO</a>, this should make it easier on Microsoft Windows
users, who often don&#8217;t know how to install fonts on their systems.
These fonts are also available to Linux users (Microsoft's license
allows this), so it allows universal access.
If you don&#8217;t already have these fonts, you can
<a href="http://corefonts.sourceforge.net/">get
Microsoft&#8217;s True Type core fonts for Linux here</a>.
RPM-based systems such as Fedora Core can
<a href="http://www.mjmwired.net/resources/mjm-fedora-fc3.shtml#ttf">
get Microsoft&#8217;s True Type core fonts for Linux prepackaged
in RPM format for Fedora Core</a>.
<p>
I experimented with the
<a href="http://www.gnome.org/fonts/">high-quality Bitstream Vera fonts</a>,
which are available to all users of
<a href="http://www.openoffice.org">OpenOffice.org</a> and have a
simpler license, but not everyone has them.

<p>
<h1>Can you Link Here?</h1>
<p>
Yes, <i>please</i> link to this page, but please also include a link to
<a href="http://www.dwheeler.com/oss_fs_why.html">
http://www.dwheeler.com/oss_fs_why.html, the address of the
more detailed study on OSS/FS this is based on.</a>
I want to make sure that people can find the original work, and including
links to it from the remote sites directly to it will make that possible.

increase the odds that it will be compatible with others&#8217; documentation.

<p>
Note that I have <i>not</i> released the original paper

<p>
<h1>Suggestions for Editors</h1>
<p>
If you want to edit these files, you simply need to get a program
that can edit OpenDocument files.
<p>
If you choose to use OpenOffice.org 2, you can generate the PDF
the same way I do.
Simply choose "File/Export as PDF", check the filename
and then select "Save".
Then select Range: All pages, Images: Lossless, and
General: Tagged PDF, Export Notes, Use Transition Effects.
I do not suggest turning on
"Tagged PDF";  it has some nice extras, but the
file balloons to 3.5M in size, as opposed to 475K, so it's
probably not worth it.
Select "Okay".  This generates the file as
(1) the slides, then (2) the annotated slides.
A single PDF with both versions makes my life much easier --
I only have to track one PDF per edition, and
people can then print the range of pages they want.

<p>
<h1>Tracking Changes</h1>
<p>
If you need an old version of this presentation, go look at the
<a href="archive/">archive for this presentation</a>.
If you want to see what has changed in this presentation or the paper
(I keep a single ChangeLog that discusses both), see the
<a href="http://www.dwheeler.com/archive/ChangeLog">Look at the Numbers
ChangeLog</a>.


<p>
<h1>Translations</h1>
<p>

<i>Please</i> contact me if you&#8217;re interested in translating it,
I&#8217;d like as many translations to become available as possible.
<p>
There are several translations of my massive tome of statistics,
for which I'm grateful, but many translators have told me that it's
just too long for them to translate.
In contrast, this presentation is quite small, and even the annotations
are not that much.
So I'm hoping that there will be <i>many</i> people who will translate
this document.
