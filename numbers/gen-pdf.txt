I've tried a number of different ways to generate PDFs.

The simplest - use OpenOffice.org 2.

Choose File/Export as PDF, check filename and then select "Save", then:
Range: All pages
Images: Lossless
General: Tagged PDF, export notes, use transition effects

Select "Okay".  This generates the file as
(1) the slides, then (2) the annotated slides.
Easy to handle, that's for sure... only one file, which makes my life easier.
People can then print the range they want.

Don't turn on "Tagged PDF".  It has some nice extras, but the
file balloons to 3.5M in size, as opposed to 475K. Not worth it.

====================
Here are some other experiments I tried.


First, installation (only need to do once):
* On Windows, install Adobe Distiller.
* Go to control panel, add printer "HP Color LaserJet 5/5M PS"
  as "print to file".
* In Distiller, create "Standard(1)" that generates Acrobat 3.0 (PDF 1.2).

To do the conversion:
* From OpenOffice.org, set the print dialogue correctly.
  - For slides, under options set "fit to page" (else the slides
    won't be centered on the page) and output "Drawings".
    Be sure to set paper orientation to "landscape"
  - For annotated slides, under options deselect "Drawings"
    and select "Notes".  Be sure to set paper orientation to "portrait".
* Print to the "LaserJet" file to create Postscript
* Use the distiller to convert PS to PDF.
* Use Acrobat 6 to reduce filesize, for Acrobat 4.
It isn't quite centered, and some fonts get translated,
but it seems to work everywhere.


ALTERNATIVES THAT DON'T WORK:

OpenOffice 1 can generate PDF using their built-in PDF generator.
That seems to be portable, but the generated fonts look ugly on-screen.
They probably print nicely, but since presentations may be viewed on
screen that's not okay.

OpenOffice 2 generates beautiful PDFs (with correct marketshare),
but hits lots of viewer bugs.  For example,
evince on Fedora Core 4 crashes on it.  Acrobat 6 can't read it,
incorrectly saying its start is wrong.

Distiller, invoked directly for OOo, hits a bug on the slide with
browser marketplace share -- the slide is mostly erased,
instead of the graphic.

Issue: I did the whole process, printing to
"HP Color LaserJet 5/5M PS", use Distiller, then used Acrobat 6 to
reduce filesize (to different file).
After reducing filesize, Adobe Acrobat couldn't view, saying:
    File does not begin with '%PDF-'
Oddly enough, the file DOES begin with "%PDF-"; I'm guessing there's
a problem with something embedded in it.  The graphics for the marketplace
display unacceptably slowly on Fedora Core 3's ggv
(over a minute before the first lines of the image show).
Will NOT compressing the file further help?
(One place claimed this was from overlong names, but it's
not >128 chars!).  Googling for bug reports suggests it's a
"long filename" problem, but even tiny filenames (q.pdf) don't work.
