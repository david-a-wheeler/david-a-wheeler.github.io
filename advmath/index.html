This is David A. Wheeler's site for the
Sovereign Grace Church (SGC) co-op Pre-Calculus class ("Advanced Math"),
which uses the textbook Saxon "Advanced Math" (2nd edition,
copyright 1996).
This site has the latest versions of all class materials, including
my detailed notes and examples for every lesson.
This site is <i>not</i> officially sponsored by SGC or the co-op, but is
provided in the hope that it will help the students in my class.
Questions from my students are welcomed and encouraged!
<p>
I offer these notes to anyone who is using this textbook, in the
hope that they will be helpful.
I am <i>delighted</i> that others are finding these notes helpful -
so if you find them helpful,
<a href="http://www.dwheeler.com/contactme.html">let me know</a>!
Here's what one happy reader said:
"<i>I have been using your notes (for circular permutations [lesson 55]
they were a big help). We live in a remote area of Florida and
I don't know any others in this area that are working on Advanced Math.</i>"
[MFurey].
One of the main reasons I teach the class is because I believe it is
important for people to learn the basics of math... I cannot teach
everyone, but this is a small way I can help.
<p>
Sadly, if you're not in my class (or at least SGC), please don't send
me math questions - I'd like to help, but I simply
can't answer math questions sent from everyone in the world (sorry!).
The co-op is a service provided by SGC to church members;
<a href="http://blogs.sovgracefairfax.org/hea/">Sovereign Grace Church
(SGC) Home Ed Blog (HEA)</a> and
<a href="http://www.sovgracefairfax.org/co-op-documents">HEA Blog
co-op documents</a> have the latest info.
<p>
A word about data formats:
I normally edit my class notes in OpenDocument format (ODF), which is the
international open standard for office documents (ISO/IEC 26300:2006).
Files ending in ".odt" are OpenDocument text (e.g., word processing format).
There are many programs that can read and write this format; two good
free ones are
<a href="http://www.libreoffice.org">LibreOffice</a> and
<a href="http://www.openoffice.org">OpenOffice.org</a>, both of which are
available for MS Windows, Apple Macintosh, Linuxes, *BSDs, and Unix.
(I'm told that Microsoft Office can also read them, but I have not checked.)
If you just want to read the notes, you can read the PDF version
(PDF is also internationally standardized);
there are lots of PDF readers, many free.
As a general rule I strongly encourage the use of
<a href="http://www.dwheeler.com/essays/opendocument-open.html">
open data standards (formats that
aren't controlled by any one vendor)</a>, such as ODF, PDF, and HTML.

I also use the international standard format for dates (ISO 8601), YYYY-MM-DD,
<a href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mgk25/iso-time.html">
which helps to avoid confusion in international
communication</a> - and it sorts well too.

I typically have notes on the lessons ready the night before, and make
minor revisions within the day after class (based on comments during class).

<p>
As you do your lesson problems, do one problem and then check the answer
(don't do all the problems at once).  Otherwise you might practice doing it
wrong.
Also, if you make a mistake, work hard to figure out exactly why, and then
figure out what to change so that you never make that mistake again.

<p>
Turn in tests on Sunday in the "HEA Tests" mailbox (lower rightmost box);
mailboxes are in the foyer behind the information desk.
<b>Parents: Please do a preliminary grading</b>; put a big "check" or
"elongated C" (correct) mark by the
correct ones, and a big "X" by the incorrect ones.  That way, I can
concentrate on figuring out partial credit, and you can have immediate
information on how well they're doing.
Here are some test-taking tips:
<ol>
<li>Show your work!  Show each step to the answer, not just the answer.
I can't give partial credit with only the answer.
And in the "real world", you'd need to show your
work to some sort of peer review, to make sure that the answer is right.
<li>Use smaller steps, and more paper.
If you try to do too many steps at once, you're much more likely to
make mistakes, and it'll be harder for you to check your work later.
It's also harder for me to help you.
Paper's cheap, mistakes aren't; feel free to use lots of paper.
I typically do only 1-2 problems per page. You don't need to use that much
paper, but please don't worry about conserving paper;
concentrate on getting the right answer.
<li>Check your work!  If you solved an equation, plug it back in and see
if you got it right.
At least examine each step and make sure each one is correct.
If you're worried about time, do all the problems and then go back and
check your work... but check your work!
This also means you need to circle your answer, so I can find it.
This will mean that your work will take more paper, but as noted above,
paper's cheap.
<li>Read and then skip problems you're not sure how to do, and come
back to them later.
That way, you can be thinking about them while you solve problems you
<i>do</i> know how to solve.  But be careful - don't forget to
do them later!
I write the problem number at the top of a blank page, and then start a
new blank page.
Before I turn it in, I count through each question (blank pages are really
easy to spot), so that I'm sure I answered them all.
<li>For creating proofs, see my
<a href="lessons9-12.pdf">lesson 9 hints on proofs</a>.
Write down what you know, try to derive what you can "easily" derive,
and then see if you can bridge the gap to what you need to show.
</ol>

After this class, you may be able to answer some of the
<a href="http://random.irb.hr/signup.php">challenges on this page</a>.

Related - here's a quick cheatsheet on
<a href="negative-numbers.pdf">Negative numbers (PDF)</a> |
<a href="negative-numbers.odt">Negative numbers (ODT)</a>.
If you need this, you shouldn't be in the Advanced Math class - I created this
for a junior high school student.

Modern mathematics has been able to prove many amazing relationships,
but like everyone mathematicians can make mistakes.
There are efforts to formalize mathematics so that computers can
automatically check math proofs to ensure they are correct.
You don't need to know about these in detail, but I think you might
find them interesting.
One of the more intriguing projects to me
is <a href="http://metamath.org">metamath</a>.
Metamath starts with the extreme basics:
set theory (using the usual Zermelo-Fraenkel definitions),
propositional calculus (which lets you prove statements about true/false
statements),
and predicate calculus (which lets you prove statements about objects).
From there, they have formally proven that numbers exist
and lots of properties about them.
You can learn a lot about math just by looking at their proofs,
in part because if there is some part you do not understand,
you can click on that part to learn more (and repeat as necessary).
For example, here is
<a href="http://us.metamath.org/mpegif/mullt0.html">a proof that
the product of two negative numbers is positive</a>.
They use common math notation:
<ul>
<li>stylized <b>R</b> is the set of real numbers
<li>stylized <b>C</b> is the set of complex numbers
<li>x &isin; B means "x is a member of the set B"
<li>p &rarr; q means "p implies q" (i.e., "p is true then q is true")
<li>p &harr; q means "p implies q, and q implies p"
<li>"^" means "and" (both sides must be true for the statement to be true)
</ul>


<p>
Legal stuff:
The Saxon book is copyrighted, so I cannot post extensive portions of the book.
To avoid running afoul of copyright law,
I create my own explanations and examples -
which means these notes are my own copyrighted work, and are not a
derivative of Saxon's work.
Having things explained in a different way, with different examples,
is better for teaching anyway
(because it gives my students more examples to learn from).
I do use the same order of instruction as Saxon's book - I don't see
how I could avoid doing so while using Saxon as the textbook!
I believe this is de minimus (so small as to not matter), but even if
it isn't, this use of Saxon's outline is clearly
<a href="http://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap1.html#107">fair use</a>.
After all, it is for the purpose of teaching,
it's for nonprofit educational purposes,
it's clearly transformative (I create new examples and explain things
differently instead of just posting the outline),
it emphasizes mathematical facts (which cannot be copyrighted),
its content is quite different from Saxon's
(it merely follows the same order), and it
does not diminish Saxon's potential market
(if anything, it increases it).
