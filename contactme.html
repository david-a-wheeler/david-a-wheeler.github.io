<h1>Contacting David A. Wheeler</h1>
<p>
You can contact me at my email address, in fact,
I gladly welcome personal email intended specifically for me!
Kudos, questions, &amp; corrections are all welcome.
Please read below for how to contact me, with caveats.

<p>
<h2>TEMPORARY PROBLEM</h2>
<p>
I have a temporary problem with my email account, so you may get
"550 relay not permitted".
Please retry after a bit.
To contact me ASAP, email my work address, dwheeler AT linuxfoundation DOT org.

<p>
<h2>Just link to my material - do not bother me with permission requests</h2>
<p>
<i>Please</i> create and publish hypertext (URL) links to <i>anything</i>
on my site &mdash; the more the better!
Please <i>don&#8217;t</i> bother me by asking for my permission;
you already have my permission.

<p>
In fact, please don&#8217;t bother <i>anyone</i> asking for permission to link
to their material, because you can link to any legal material you want to.
In April 2000, Federal Judge Harry L. Hupp&#8217;s ruling on deep
linking <i>Ticketmaster vs. Tickets.com, Inc</i>, 2000 U.S. Dist LEXIS
12987 (D. Cal. 2000) stated that, &#8220;hyperlinking does not itself involve
a violation of the Copyright Act... since no copying is involved&#8221;.
When there were only a few people on the Internet, asking for permission was
pointless but harmless.
But nowadays, useless requests for permission have become a serious waste
of everyone&#8217;s time.

<p>
If you want to link to my site, and
your attorneys tell you that permission is required,
please try to replace them with competent attorneys.
If you cannot replace them, then please contact me.

<p>
I <i>can</i> sign papers if you really need it,
but I expect to be compensated for my time.
If the agreement is short and clear, my usual fee for
signing a link permission request for a commercial organization is $50.

<p>
<h2>Make sure you have the right person</h2>
<p>
Please make sure you really intend to talk with <i>me</i>.
I&#8217;m <i>not</i>:
<ol>
<li><a href="http://www.kineticode.com/">David E. Wheeler, who develops
Bricolage (an OSS/FS CMS package)</a>. We <i>both</i> use Perl, and both develop FLOSS programs.
<li>David John Wheeler (deceased) who
invented the <a href+"http://www.simonshepherd.supanet.com/tea.htm">
TEA and XTEA encryption algorithms</a> and co-invented the subroutine.
<li>David M. Wheeler, who wrote the
<a href="http://www.acsac.org/2001/abstracts/wed-1030-b-wheeler.html">
ACSAC 2001 paper
&#8220;Java Security Extensions for a Java Server in a Hostile Environment&#8221;</a>
(I have written an
<a href="https://dwheeler.com/trusting-trust">ACSAC 2005 paper on countering
trusting trust</a>, a
<a href="https://dwheeler.com/javasec/">Java security tutorial</a>, and
a 
<a href="https://dwheeler.com/secure-programs">book on how to write secure programs</a>).
<li>Dave Wheeler, who specializes in Microsoft&#8217;s .&#78;ET
stuff (Dave writes training courses, books, and articles about .&#78;ET).
</ol>
I <i>never</i> go by Dave, and
I always use my middle initial (A) in written material -
hopefully that will help people distinguish between us.

<h2>Email privacy: None by default</h2>
<p>
I assume that messages sent to me <i>may</i> be shared with the
public unless you tell me otherwise.
<p>
I often keep private email private, as a courtesy to the sender,
but I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;m legally obligated to do so.
Please let me know (in the email)
if you <i>really</i> want me to keep something private; I get
a <i>lot</i> of email, and if you can&#8217;t take the time
to tell me &#8220;please keep this private&#8221;, please
don&#8217;t expect me to take the time to keep it private either.
I simply don&#8217;t have the time to constantly email back to everyone who
sends me an email, just to find out if I can post it.
Courts and government agencies typically work the same way; they
typically require senders to mark stuff that&#8217;s private / confidential /
whatever when it&#8217;s sent, because it&#8217;s too hard to handle things otherwise.
<p>
Sometimes I&#8217;ll keep messages private because I can guess that you intended
for them to be private.
But <i>don&#8217;t</i> expect me to do so; I&#8217;m only human,
and I <i>will</i> guess wrong sometimes.
If you want me to keep your message private, tell me that in your message.

<h2>What&#8217;s this ham password stuff?</h2>
<p>
The ham password is simply a password that shows me that you&#8217;re
not an automated system sending me unsolicited bulk email (&#8221;spam&#8221;).
You can surround the ham password with parentheses to make it clearer.
You are <i><b>not</b></i> permitted to send unsolicited bulk email
(UBE, commonly referred to as <i>spam</i>)</a>
to any of my email addresses, or to sell my email addresses to people who do.
<p>
Why do I have an ham password?
Basically,
I receive a horrendous amount of spam, so I use various filters
and <i>automatically throw away, without review,</i>
all email that looks like spam.
I&#8217;m sorry, but it has to be that way.
Including my ham password in a subject line
is not a guarantee that I&#8217;ll see it, but
it <i>greatly</i> increases the odds.
Be sure that your message doesn&#8217;t look like spam!
For example, use a very specific subject line
(not &#8220;hi&#8221;, URGENT, a blank line, or other nondescript things).
Send the message as ordinary text; I normally ignore HTML text, and
messages with just a URL will be trashed too.
Use English; I don&#8217;t read anything else well
(my technical French is only tolerable), and I get a lot of
non-English spam.
Never send me executable attachments like &#8220;.exe&#8221; files;
those are immediately tossed
(no one should <i>ever</i> execute arbitrary code sent by email, since
email is easily spoofed and malware can send email from
a compromised machine).
Useful attachments (like patches to my source code)
are <i>very</i> welcome,
but the main body of your text will need to convince me that
I should open the attachment.
When in doubt, I throw it out.
<p>
Placing the ham password in the body of the message will not help;
a spammer could include lots of guesses in a message body.
The ham password only has an effect if it&#8217;s in the subject line,
and due to subject line lengths (which I can impose!),
they can&#8217;t do much automated
guessing without sending a ton of messages (and I would notice that too).
Once spammers start exploiting a ham password, I just change it.
<p>
If you&#8217;re interested in learning more about my approach to countering spam,
see my essay
<a href="https://dwheeler.com/essays/spam-email-password.html">Countering Spam Using Ham Passwords (Email Passwords)</a>, as well as my background essay on
<a href="https://dwheeler.com/essays/stopspam.html">stopping spam</a>.
You&#8217;ll notice that the image above is a simple kind of
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captcha">Captcha</a>, a test to
determine if the reader is human or not (to counter automated email
address capturing tools).
<p>
By the way, never send email to
<a href="mailto:badaddress@dwheeler.com">badaddress@dwheeler.com</a>.
That&#8217;s a dead giveaway that you&#8217;re a spammer, because no one has a
legitimate need to send email there.
Don&#8217;t worry, I&#8217;m aware that spammers often forge the &#8220;from&#8221; address.

By sending spam (spam is unsolicited bulk email, both
commercial and noncommercial) to any of my email addresses
(extracted from any source, including website pages or postings),
you agree to pay a fee of USD $10,000.00 per message.
I consider such actions actionable trespass to personal property,
theft of private resources, and willful harassment.
If you&#8217;re sending an email to many people (say over 1000), and they
didn&#8217;t specifically grant you permission to do so, you&#8217;re a spammer.

<p>
Spam is any unsolicited bulk email.  If I didn&#8217;t sign up for your list
(or in some other way specifically authorize you to send me information),
and you&#8217;re sending the same logical message to more than a thousand
people, you&#8217;re a spammer.
Spammers are by definition unethical, and in many locales criminal;
please do something positive for the world instead!

<h2>Legal threats</h2>
<p>
<img src="https://dwheeler.com/images/liberty_waits_ad.png" alt="Keep on Blogging!" width="160" height="213" border="0" align="right"></a>
I reserve the right to publicly publish any legal threats sent to me,
without permission of the sender (even if the sender says it&#8217;s private).
This is to encourage the ridicule, scorn, and shaming of people who
send me nonsense legal threats.
I know my rights; see
