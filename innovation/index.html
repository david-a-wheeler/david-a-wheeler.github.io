<h1>Software Innovations</h1>

This web page page is dedicated to identifying
<i>software innovations</i>.
To learn more, see the paper
<a href="innovation.html"><i>The Most Important Software Innovations</i></a>.

After I wrote the innovation paper, I was curious to see how
Microsoft fared.
After all, Microsoft claims that it shouldn't be penalized for
its illegal activities, and that the government shouldn't
encourage open source software, because Microsoft is an innovator.
I looked into this, and found their arguments to be bunk;
my summary is in
<a href="microsoft.html"><i>Microsoft, the Innovator?</i></a>.
