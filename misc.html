Far too many programs have a horrendous user interface; I'd like
to see more programs pay more attention to usability.
This is a problem for both proprietary and OSS/FS programs.

about 90% of usability guidelines from a 1986 Air Force report

There are lots of ways to vote (say, for public office or a group decision)
where there must be a single winner.
The traditional, most widely used, and simplistic approach
is when each person votes once for a single choice,
and the choice with the largest count wins.
This is called plurality voting.
The problem is that if there are more than 2 choices, this can
product undesirable results
(<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duvergers_Law">Duverger's law</a>
asserts there can only be two parties with plurality voting).
For example, a party split can mean that the choice least liked
is the one selected!
For many circumstances, more sophisticated voting methods
can represent far more accurately the will of a group.
It can't be perfect;
around 1950, Stanford economist Kenneth J. Arrow
proved that a completely ideal election method can't exist.
The proof is called
<a href="http://www.electionmethods.org/Arrow.htm">Arrow's Theorem</a>,
and he won the Bank of Sweden Prize (the "Nobel prize in Economics")
for the proof.
However, although the Arrow theorem is an important theoretical result,
Arrow's definition of an ideal voting mechanism is extremely restrictive;
less restrictive criteria that are very desirable <i>can</i> be satisfied.
Thus, various voting schemes
are far better than simplistic alternatives when there are 3 or more
options, even though they can't achieve a theoretical perfection.
There's lots of information on
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voting_system">
various voting mechanisms</a>;
<a href="http://electorama.com/">Electorama</a> links to voting methods.
After reading the literature, I think there are basically two
especially useful methods:
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Approval_voting">approval voting</a>
and
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Condorcet_method">
Condorcet-based voting schemes</a>.
<ul>
<li>
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Approval_voting">
Approval voting</a> is simple and at least avoids some of
instant runoff's worst problems; see
<a href="http://approvalvoting.org">approvalvoting.org</a> for an
advocacy site for them.
Basically, you can vote for any of the choices you approve of, and the
one with the most approvals wins.
Their simplicity is a big advantage.
But while approval voting is simple, approval voting systems don't
allow people to indicate their preferences for one over another.
<li>
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Condorcet_method">
Condorcet-based systems</a>, while harder to explain,
have much to recommend them.
In particular, people can specify who they prefer, and
Condorcet methods accurately use that information.
<a href="http://www.electionmethods.org/CondorcetEx.htm">
electionmethods.org gives a helpful definition of Condorcet methods.</a>
One complication with any preference-based system is that it's
possible for voters to create circularity, for example,
people might prefer A over B, B over C, and C over A!
If there's no circularity, all Condorcet methods give the same answer,
but there are many different methods for handling those circularities
if they occur.
One of the consensus "best" approaches
goes by the long name "Cloneproof Schwartz Sequential Dropping"
(this is equivalent to "Beatpath Winner").
Other strong approaches include
<a href="http://condorcet.org/rp">ranked pairs (RP)</a> (invented by
Nicolaus Tideman),
<a href="http://radicalcentrism.org/majority_voting.html">Maximum majority voting (MMV)</a>,
and
<a href="http://www.alumni.caltech.edu/~seppley">
Maximize Affirmed Majorities (MAM)</a>.
<a href="http://www.electionmethods.org">Electionmethods.org has
more information about Condorcet-based systems.</a>
It's unfortunate that there's more than one Condorcet method;
while in most cases it doesn't matter, people <i>do</i> have to pick a
specific method for a given election.
I hope that several
academics will analyze the properties of each method so they can be fully
understood, and that a consensus can determine the "best" approach
(or a way to pick the best approach for a given set of circumstances).
The Debian project has a sophisticated voting mechanism based on Condorcet
that's very interesting;
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-vote/2003/debian-vote-200306/msg00036.html">see this June 2003 posting giving a justification for
their approach, a variant of
Cloneproof Schwartz Sequential Dropping" (cSSD)</a> (based on Condorcet).
Debian's approach supports voting by preference between multiple options
without many of the problems of simple schemes, and handles options
which have different majority requirements.
For voters it's pretty simple -- rank your preferences, and just rank
"do nothing" higher than any option you disapprove of.
The <a href="http://www.debian.org/devel/constitution">Debian Constitution</a>
describes their mechanics in detail (see section A).
But it is possible in these systems to intentionally vote in a way that
isn't your true preference, in order to get someone you rank higher;
while not easy, that's a disadvantage.
And these are complicated, too.
Thus, I suspect in many circumstances the best you can do is
approval voting, which is simple to explain and use.
</ul>
There are other systems, but they're really not as good.
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instant_Runoff_Voting">instant
runoff voting</a> is relatively simple to explain, but
<a href="http://www.electionmethods.org/IRVproblems.htm">instant runoff
has many of the same flaws as the traditional approach.</a>
There's another system called
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borda_count">Borda counting</a>, but
<a href="http://www.electionmethods.org/Borda.htm">
Borda has significant problems with "tactical voting"</a> -- it can encourage
insincere voting -- and in some cases
<a href="http://www.electionmethods.org/Borda.htm">Borda counting can fail
to elect a candidate selected by a majority as their favorite.</a>
Basically, I don't think Borda is a good choice at all.
Basically, you shouldn't use instant runoff or Borda;
use approval voting or Condorcet systems instead.
<a href="http://www.electionmethods.org/evaluation.htm">This technical
evaluation of voting methods is very enlightening.</a>
I'm looking forward to seeing more Condorcet-based systems;
they're currently rare, but
they have a lot of advantages in accurately capturing the will of a people.

Programming cross-platform GUI applications, and the simple "dialog"
options don't work?
There are many options, which can be grouped on the basic toolkit or language.
Many people are moving away from using GUI builders that generate code;
instead, people use GUI builders to build data structures and call-outs,
and then create a very small program that loads the GUI builder's
data structures (this simplifies changing things).
Here's some info I found:
<ol>
<li><a href="http://wxwidgets.org">wxWidgets</a>:
This is the cross-platform GUI library I hear the most about.
It's implemented in C++, but the
<a href="http://www.wxpython.org/">wxPython interface</a>
lets you use Python (which is much simpler).
For wxWidgets form-building, there's wxFormBuilder and wxGlade.
<a href="http://sturlamolden.blogspot.com/2008/03/howto-using-wxformbuilder-with-wxpython.html">This page
provides "HelloWorld" for Python + wxFormBuilder + wxWidgets</a>.
<a href="http://wiki.wxpython.org/index.cgi/XRCTutorial">Here's more about
wxPython + XRC (XML Resource)</a>.
If you want a full IDE that supports wxPython,
PythonCard and spe do that (and there are yummable Fedora packages).
PythonCard says that it is "for you if you want to develop
graphical applications quickly and easily with a minimum of effort and coding."
There's also
<a href="http://boa-constructor.sourceforge.net/">Boa Constructor</a>,
which supports wxPython, but no Fedora package.
<li>GTK+: In the GTK+ world,

Basically, libglade's dynamic loading capability is getting moved into GTK+
itself as <a href="http://blogs.gnome.org/johan/2007/06/15/gtkbuilder-has-landed/">GtkBuilder</a>, and some cleanup was done for the transition.
Glade will generate gtkbuilder XML directly, but in the meantime, you need
to run a converter program (not a big deal).

<li>Java: Java has some extra decisions.  For Java-native interfaces
you can choose Swing (reference GUI for J2SE)
or Standard Widget Toolkit (SWT), developed by IBM as part of Eclipse.
There's also the older AWT.

Here is developer.com's comparison of SWT and Swing</a>, and
<a href="http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/grid/library/os-swingswt/">
IBM developerWorks' article on SWT, Swing, and AWT</a>.
SWT tries to be close to the native platform; Swing tries to abstract
away from it.
AWT is much older; it's a simple toolkit with limited capabilities, but
it does have the advantage of stability.
<li>Qt: "Qt Jambi" is an interface to Qt for Java.
Qt has had licensing issues in the far past, but it's now released under
the LGPL which I think should be great for everyone.
Qt is implemented in C++ with several non-standard extensions,
an implementation approach I don't like, but there are
certainly many happy developers.

Some projects appear to be impossible, such as
solving "NP-complete" problems for a large number of items ("large n").
In contrast, some projects are possible - but unaffordable.
Since the late 1980s, I and some co-workers have had a phrase for
unaffordable projects: "GNP-complete" problems.
They're solvable, but they require a country's entire
Gross National Product to solve.
Thankfully, many GNP-complete problems can be reduced or simplified
so they become affordable, and there's always hope for a breakthrough.

An excellent way to take over a democracy is take control of
its voting system.
Stuffing ballot boxes isn't new, but now we have a high-tech way to
control every ballot box in a country: electronic voting machines.
Stuffing physical ballot boxes requires a lot of dangerous work and
is hard to to do undetected; changing an electronic value to a "desirable"
value can be done by one person in microseconds.
And given some of today's unverifiable
electronic voting systems, it's impossible
to detect that someone has stolen the elections.
I'm very concerned about unverifiable
electronic voting systems, especially since the
manufacturer's leaders appear quite partisan.

memos had a number of scary statements.
<a href="http://www.securityfocus.com/columnists/198">Scott Granneman's
"Electronic Voting Debacle"</a> documents many of the concerns.
These unverifiable systems are also called
"Direct-Recording Electronic (DRE) systems", because they record vote results

anyone to change or modify the software, and there are no technical
safeguards in place to ensure that only authorized people can make changes.

There's a solution, and that's verified voting - see the
<a href="http://www.verifiedvoting.org/">verified voting site</a>.
The Verified Voting Foundation advocates
the use of voter-verified paper ballots (VVPBs) for all elections
(so voters can inspect individual permanent records of their ballots
before they are cast and so meaningful recounts may be conducted),
insists that electronic voting equipment and software be open
to public scrutiny, and that random, surprise recounts
be conducted on a regular basis to audit election equipment.
I would add three things:
(1) there must be separate voting stations and ballot readers,
where the ballot reader totals are the only official votes
(this prevents a collusion by the voting station), and
(2) there should a standard paper ballot format; this makes it possible
to have independent recounts using equipment from different manufacturers, as
well as making it possible to mix-and-match vendor equipment
(lowering costs for everyone);
(3) there should a standard electronic formats for
defining elections and producing results, again to make it
possible to dramatically reduce costs by enabling mixing and
matching of equipment.

It's pretty scary that the U.S. protects voting for academy award winners
more than voting for U.S. president.

Their system is
"designed to make sure each Academy member’s vote is accurately represented".
In particular,
"It is totally analog, and will remain so, in part because the Academy
believes that anything that is in a computer will eventually be hacked."
What, exactly, does that say about the country? Why do we protect the selection
of Oscar winners more than presidential winners?

The counts will still be done electronically, but the voters will
get to use paper directly.... which eliminates many (though not all)

This is good news, especially if they standardize the paper so that

<ul>
<li>Paperless DRE voting machines should be immediately phased out
from US elections in favor of systems, such as precinct-counted

<li>Statistical “risk limiting audits” should be used after every election

Unisys had been threatening many people if they used GIF
(although as far as I can tell, their patents only applied to
writing, not reading, the compressed format often used in GIF).
According to
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/gif.html">
http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/gif.html</a>,
who searched the patent databases of the USA, Canada, Japan,
and the European Union, here are the relevant dates.
The Unisys patent expired on 20 June 2003 in the USA, but it
does not expire in most of Europe until 18 June 2004,
in Japan until 20 June 2004 and in Canada until 7 July 2004.
The U.S. IBM patent expired 11 August 2006.
The fact that two companies (IBM and Unisys) have been
allowed to have two separate patents on the <i>same</i> algorithm
clearly demonstrates
how poorly patents are examined - the patent office couldn't even
be bothered to search <i>their own</i> patent database for
previously-granted patents.
The IBM patent should have been tossed out immediately, since a
previous patent already covered it.

<a href="http://www.bu.edu/law/central/jd/organizations/journals/scitech/volume141/documents/Klemens.pdf">"The Rise of the Information Processing Patent" by Ben Klemens</a> (published in the Journal of Science &amp; Technology Law)
argues against software patents; it "recommends a return to the distinction that inventions consisting of information processing plus a trivial physical step be barred from patentability."
Section I provides a legal perspective; in it, he explains that
"it is impossible to write a section of the Manual of Patent Examination
Procedure (MPEP) that allows the patenting of software but excludes from
patentability the evaluation of purely mathematical algorithms. The proof of
this is in the formal Church-Turing thesis (that software and mathematical
algorithms are in the same equivalence class) and Knuth’s comment that all
information is data; demonstrations of this weaker Church-Turing thesis will
appear repeatedly below. In short, once one type of information processing is
patentable, all types are patentable. Because there are various types of
information processing that many think should not be patentable, the
patentability of any one type of pure information processing creates myriad
problems."
Section II provides an economic perspective; and shows
"why allowing software and business methods to be patentable creates
transaction costs that easily dwarf the benefits that such patent protection
may provide. The key concept behind the discussion is that these
pseudo-industries are massively decentralized, and patents do
not efficiently promote progress in a decentralized industry.
Unlike copyright, independent invention is not a valid
defense against claims of patent infringement.
If there are millions of potential independent inventors,
then the waste and economic loss associated with
restrictions on independent inventors becomes inevitable."
Indeed,
"adding up the settlements we find a variety of companies, some in
traditional software and many elsewhere, paying billions of dollars for
the right to use software they conceived and wrote without
outside assistance—and those are just the headlines."
Although many software patents are also obvious,
"Fixing the obviousness problem would do nothing, however,
to alleviate the problems with applying patents to a massive industry."
Instead, "A great many of the problems with patents that fill the newspapers
and vex businessmen can be solved by reinstating the distinction from Diehr
and its predecessors that indicate a device is patentable only if it is based on
steps that are simultaneously novel and non-trivially physical...
There is a history of court rulings stating that pure
information processing is not patentable, even when a patent draftsman adds
'insignificant postsolution activity' to apply the information to real-world
affairs. Thus, this judicial line distinguishing the patentable from the
unpatentable exactly matches the ideal economic line that divides traditional
industries that prospered with patents from the massively decentralized
information-based industries that have prospered without patents."

summarized the situation this way:
"The clear implication of the statement above is that John Doll
is grossly wrong
when he states that patent quality is the number one focus of the USPTO: the
number one and only focus of the USPTO is the amount of time that each patent

<a href="http://www.fortune.com/fortune/fortune75/articles/0,15114,1101810-1,00.html">Fortune's "The Law of Unintended Consequences"
(Sep. 19, 2005)</a> notes that patents in the medical field
are making a few rich, but inhibiting innovation in the process:
"The problem is, once it became clear that individuals could own little parcels of biology or chemistry, the common domain of scientific exchange--that dynamic place where theories are introduced, then challenged, and ultimately improved--begins to shrink. What's more, as the number of claims grows, so do the overlapping claims and legal challenges. This isn't merely a hypothetical situation, a 'worst-case scenario' painted by academic hand-wringers. It has already happened, as two professors at the University of Michigan Law School, Michael Heller and Rebecca Eisenberg, observed in a seminal 1998 article in Science magazine...
Heller and Eisenberg dubbed this new dismal state of affairs the 'Tragedy of the Anticommons.' And that's what it is--a tragedy that's still in the making."
They then note, "it's clear who pays for it. You do. You pay in the form of vastly higher drug prices and health-care insurance. Americans spent $179 billion on prescription drugs in 2003. That's up from ... wait for it ... $12 billion in 1980."

<p>
Software patents need to be scrapped; they do <i>far</i> more
harm than good to the software industry.
But it may be a very long time before they go away - patent lawyers
in particular make a pile of money from them, and they make the rules.
In the meantime, some people are working within the (broken) legal
framework to reduce the unnecessary and serious damage that
software patents cause.

Microsoft is making lots of patent threats... yet won't actually say what
the patents are, and seems to be conceding that it won't actually sue anyone
(what's a threat when you admit you won't actually do anything?).
Microsoft is playing with fire here; organizations like the
The <a href="http://www.openinventionnetwork.com/">

software patent attacks.
Their mission is to "further software innovation by acquiring patents
to be used for cross-licensing purposes to defend the Linux
environment - making them available on a royalty-free basis
[to those programs]."
In short, if Microsoft strikes, they risk a massive patent counterattack,
in which their key products (Windows and Office) will suddenly have a wave
of patent lawsuits.
Lots of individual companies (esp. IBM) have relevant patents too.
The

certain conditions (typically not attacking open source software), which

Open standards are critical, but years ago NIST decided that they

What's the Matter With Standards in China?</a>
notes that
"When the question of standards is raised in China, officials and companies are quick to focus on one issue: intellectualy property rights...
China's drive to develop its own technology standards (open and closed) is directly linked to its intent to avoid IPR owned by foreign companies...
China does not want its innovation, its industrial development beholden to others. And does not want to spend the next 20 years watching royalties and license fees flow overseas. Even pledges not to sue are unacceptable...
Hence, its move to open standards, and in particular standards without any IPR... at least one official... maintained that a standard is not "open" if it has any IPR in its specification."

It makes no sense when people volunteer their work to others, but those
others get exclusive rights to exploit the work.
Standards have had this problem for some time - ISO
shamelessly exploits the volunteers

fees for the stuff it didn't write.
ISO actually manages to <i>discourage</i> the use of standards with
its foolish policies, which is why
the IETF, W3C, and other organizations which freely distribute standards
have become increasingly relevant (and ISO increasingly less relevant).

<a href="http://www.psych.org/public_info/insanity.cfm?pf=y">The Insanity
Defense</a> is an interesting page.
It notes that
"According to a 1991 eight-state study funded by the National Institute of Mental Health, the insanity defense was used in less than one percent of the cases in a representative sampling of cases before those states' county courts. The study showed that only 26 percent of those insanity pleas were argued successfully.
Most studies show that in approximately 80 percent of the cases where a defendant is acquitted on a "not guilty by reason of insanity" finding, it is because the prosecution and defense have agreed on the appropriateness of the plea before trial.
That agreement occurred because both the defense and prosecution agreed that the defendant was mentally ill and met the jurisdiction's test for insanity.
Clearly, the implication is that the insanity defense is rarely used successfully by malingerers.

Other studies over the past two decades report similar findings.
According to Myths and Realities: A Report of the National Commission on the Insanity Defense, in 1982 only 52 of 32,000 adult defendants represented by the Public Defender's office in New Jersey--less than two tenths of one percent--entered the insanity plea, and only 15 were successful.
A similar number of insanity defense pleadings--"far less than one percent"--were entered in Virginia during the same period.
A 2001 study in Manhattan (Kirschner and Galperin) noted that over a ten year period, psychiatric defenses were offered by only 16 out of every 10,000 indicted defendants.
More than 75% of the time that a psychiatric defense was successful, it was the result of the prosecutors' consent.
Out of nearly 100,000 felony indictments during that period, only 17 juries heard arguments concerning the insanity defense and their deliberations resulted in only 4 insanity acquittals.
These authors concluded, "if the prosecutor does not accept the defense, the judge or the jury is not very likely to accept it either."

There's a lot of stuff related to the old Apple ][ line.

Heck, there's even an
<a href="http://www.eamonag.org/">Eamon Adventurer's Guild</a>.
Unfortunately, for the emulators to run real Apple ][ programs,
you need the Apple [] ROMs and operating systems.
At least some operating systems may not be as hard;
<a href="http://modena.intergate.ca/personal/gslj/iiefreeware.html">
Diversi-DOS is now freely available</a> as a better replacement for DOS 3.3,
and an old ProDOS can be downloaded from Apple.
ROMs are easy if have an old Apple (millions do), but others have
a harder time.
Franklin Computer once sold Apple clones with ROMs, but it
<a href="http://samsara.law.cwru.edu/comp_law/apple.html">
turns out that Franklin directly copied the ROM code from Apple</a>
(which was, not suprisingly, found to be illegal).
Perhaps someday someone will create an OSS project to recreate a
functional equivalent of the Apple ][ ROMs; even just the ROMs to
boot a disk and a computer would be enough for many binary programs.

Forth is an interesting old language, though not practical for most of
today's applications.
Implementations could be interactive, take very little memory
(a few K for good ones), could be fully understood, and be reasonably fast.
But the trade-offs are that programmers have to manage their own stack
(instead of letting the computer track it for them), and no typesafety;
this is a trade-off that's hard to justify in most real applications
today.
Still, it's fun to learn, and definitely expands the mind.
<a href="http://dec.bournemouth.ac.uk/forth/forth.html">
"Forth: An underview" by Peter Knaggs</a> has a nice summary of it
(the books "Starting Forth" and "Thinking Forth" are good too).

Notes:

    * This code implements classes and subclasses, with public methods and instance variables.
    * This is one of the simplest object-oriented Forths that is reasonably usable. The code is not pretty, but it is standard, compact, and reasonably well-factored.
    * The programmer is not SHOUTING-uppercase is required for *strict* ANSI Forth compliance. (Lowercase letter support is common, but optional.)
    * HYPE compiles into less than 2K of code on almost any Forth (1147 bytes on Win32Forth). On several platforms it would use less than 500 bytes.

Given the code above, a Forth programmer can write code like:

 : VAR 1 CELLS DEFS ;       \ Helper for creating instance vars


 CLASS BUTTON
    VAR TEXT
    VAR LEN
    VAR X
    VAR Y
 : DRAW ( )
   X @ Y @ AT-XY            \ Get X and Y, and position cursor on screen
   TEXT @ LEN @ TYPE ;      \ Get TEXT and LENgth, and type it
 : INIT ( ca u)   0 X ! 0 Y ! LEN ! TEXT ! ;
 END


 : BOLD   27 EMIT ." [1m" ;   \ Emit code to turn on BOLD TEXT
 : NORMAL 27 EMIT ." [0m" ;   \ Emit code to return to normal text


 BUTTON SUBCLASS BOLD-BUTTON
 : DRAW ( )   BOLD SUPER DRAW NORMAL ;
 END


...which could be used like:

 BUTTON NEW FOO                \ creates new button "FOO"
 S" thin foo" FOO INIT         \ calls init method on FOO with string arg.
 PAGE                          \ clear the screen
 FOO DRAW                      \ draw FOO
 BOLD-BUTTON NEW BAR           \ create new bold-button
 S" fat bar" BAR INIT          \ initialize
 1 BAR Y !                     \ change the Y instance variable
 BAR DRAW                      \ draw the BAR button

There's a lesson here for future standards writeres.
<a href="http://www.forth.com/resources/evolution/evolve_3.html">Forth
has changed a lot over the years</a>.
Much of this was to try to generalize assumptions, which is fine.
However, many years ago there was a Forth-79, followed a few years
later by a FORTH-83 that had many improvements but "grave incompatibilities".
For example, in Forth-79, TRUE returned 1 and NOT inverted a boolean flag.
In Forth-83, "true" became all ones (-1 since two's complement is assumed)
and NOT became bitwise complement.
As in all languages, what matters is what the IF statement considers true;
in Forth-83, 0 is false, all else is true.
This was a serious screw-up in my opinion; while the representation of TRUE
can be covered up remarkably often, NOT is extremely common, so
having a specification change the semantics of a common operation
created a big problem.
Later specs solved much of this by defining new names with rigorous
unique semantics.. then people could redefine the words to what they needed.
A
<a href="http://www.forth200x.org/documents/html/core.html">more recent spec</a>
shows
INVERT inverts all bits,
0= reports if a value is equal to 0 (returning TRUE if it's 0, FALSE if not),
NEGATE flips an integer's sign (so 3 becomes -3)...
and NOT isn't defined at all.
That was actually a good move, since while NOT was widely used, these
two conflicting and incompatible standards meant that there was no
<i>actual</i> agreement on the semantics of NOT.
You could define NOT the way you needed, or search-and-replace all instances
of NOT with the word you meant.
The newer spec
it still keeps the (arguably better) Forth-83 semantics of booleans values,
but in a way that made it much easier to port software to
(as well as making the intention clearer).
Similar things happened with the way they handled division;
they allowed some flexibility for the usual operation, and if you needed
a specific semantic, they provided those as separately-named words.
The original spec authors were too short-sighted and overspecified things
like word length (16 bits).
Later spec writers fixed this, but at least in this case they did it by
removing constraints (you don't have to use 16 bits) and by adding new
operations (e.g., CELL and CELLS) whose names would not conflict with
existing names (and thus didn't cause portability problems).
Spec writers would be wise to think about how hard it is for
language implementers and application writers to transition to the newer
spec... "small" things can be big.
(Python 3, I'm looking at you.)

Users of Unix-like systems usually need to type in their passwords
to log in, and most systems use PAM.
It'd be nice to protect data if it's on a laptop that could get stolen,
or a system that could be broken into while the user isn't logged in.
A nice solution would be to
create a PAM module that used the password entered as a key for
confidential data
(e.g., to decrypt a password or other keyring, or to access
an encrypted filesystem).
If the decrypted information and derived key were removed on log out,
someone who later stole the laptop would have to break the decryption.
This might be useful to add to the
<a href="http://gnomesupport.org/wiki/index.php/GNOME%20Keyring%20Manager%20Wiki">GNOME Keyring Manager</a> for example.

was being used by Red Hat and/or the other Linux companies that would
give us some leverage. (There was, at one stage, the idea that we would
sell licences to corporate customers who were using Linux as a kind of
"insurance policy" in case it turned out that they were using code which
infringed on our copyright)."
The consultant was to review the Linux code and compare it to Unix source
code, to find possible copyright infringement. Davidson himself said
that he had not expected to find anything significant based on his own
knowledge of the code and had voiced his opinion that it was "a waste
of time". After 4 to 6 months of consultant's work, Davidson says,
"we had found absolutely *nothing*. ie no evidence of any copyright
infringement whatsoever."
They had found some places where they were identical, but in all cases
that was because they had legally come from a common source
(such as X Windows).

If you're interested in trying out GNU/Linux, it's best to start with
one of the better-known distributions, such as Red Hat's, Novell/SuSE's,
Mandriva (formerly MandrakeSoft), Ubuntu, and/or Debian.
I use Red Hat Fedora Core myself, which works well.
But here are a few pointers:
<ol>
<li>
If you choose to install Red Hat Fedora, you might find that you want
to install extras, proprietary add-ons, or change its configuration.

You can upgrade Fedora systems in various ways.
As of Fedora 9, the new easy way is a network upgrade using
<a href="http://koji.fedoraproject.org/koji/packageinfo?packageID=6045">
preupgrade</a>, as discussed in
<a href="http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Interviews/PreUpgrade">
this interview</a>.
You can invoke this through your updater.
Before using preupgrade, you should update all packages to the latest version.
Here's the old way, which is now obsolete:
You can do a network upgrade by creating a
"Rescue disk" (which is small), boot it, and update it that way
(this way you don't need to create big CDs with all the packages).
<a href="ftp://mirror.cs.princeton.edu/pub/mirrors/fedora/linux/releases/8/Fedora/i386/iso/">Here's one of the places to get a rescue disk</a>.
You need to tell it where to get the packages, and how;
<a href="http://mirrors.fedoraproject.org/publiclist/Fedora/7/">Fedora
maintains a list of mirrors</a>.
(<a href="http://docs.fedoraproject.org/install-guide/f7/en_US/sn-which-files.html">Here's some more info</a>).
E.G., you might say "use HTTP", then "mirrors.kernel.org" for the site, and
then /fedora/releases/7/Fedora/i386/os for the name of download point.
Those with dynamic IP addresses can just use them.
I have statically-assigned IP addresses, so I had to specify them.
No big deal if you have a static IP address,
but be sure to know your IP address, gateway address, and
DNS address; you'll need to give your address in form A.B.C.D/X, where
X is the number of bits that are in the network address; 24 is a common
value for X.
From then on, you can use "yum update -y" as needed to get the latest updates.
<!--
 Kernel updates sometimes confuse yum, according to:

 http://lists.atrpms.net/pipermail/atrpms-users/2007-February/006858.html
 Error: Missing Dependency: /boot/vmlinuz-2.6.18-1.2257.fc5 is needed

 Error: Missing Dependency: /boot/vmlinuz-2.6.18-1.2257.fc5 is needed
 by package alsa-kmdl-2.6.18-1.2257.fc5

 If that happens, do this:
   yum update -y kernel
   yum update yum-plugin-kmdl # If never done before
   yum update

Fedora 12 looks nice once installed, but I will say I've had more
problems installing it than most.
On a Dell Optiplex 620, I had to add a kernel boot-line
entry "iommu=soft" when running and rebooting else the disk would fail with
"kernel: mpage_da_map_blocks block allocation failed..." messages;
I can do that, but that is a disaster for non-technical people.
I had to
<a href="http://digitizor.com/2009/06/17/how-to-fix-the-cannot-retrieve-repository-metadata-repomd-xml-error-in-fedora-11/">fix yum to work</a>, too.
Fedora 12's installer
<a href="http://forums.fedoraforum.org/showthread.php?t=234875">

"active" flag (this will be fixed in Fedora 13).

<a href="http://ubuntuguide.org/">Unofficial Ubuntu Starter Guide</a>,

GNOME uses a new "spatial mode" in its file viewer, which some people hate.
This is easily changed; while viewing files, select Edit/Preferences,
view the "Behavior" tab, and select "Always open in browser windows".
If you have an ancient version of GNOME, or what to automate this selection,
you can use "gconf-editor" to do this.
In that case, you may need to install it
(in Fedora, install package "gconf-editor").
You can then run gconf-editor from the GUI by selecting the "Main Menu"
(foot or distribution symbol), then select
System Tools/ Configuration Editor;
then turn on the checkbox for
/apps/nautilus/preferences/always_use_browser.
You can do this from the command line in one step by typing this command
as one line into a terminal:
<pre>
gconftool-2 --type bool --set
  /apps/nautilus/preferences/always_use_browser true
</pre>

If you plan to install a dual-boot system with Linux and Windows XP
on the same system, and install a 2004-era Linux distribution,
there's really important information you need about
a bug you may encounter.
Some mid-2004 Linux releases based on Linux 2.6 (including
<a href="http://bugzilla.redhat.com/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=115980">Fedora Core Core 2 (bug 115980)</a>,
SUSE 9.1, and
<a href="http://qa.mandrakesoft.com/show_bug.cgi?id=7959">Mandrake 10</a>)
have a bug that in rare cases causes Windows XP to not boot after
a Linux installation.
If this happens to you, don't panic; instead,
<a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/86835">read this article on dual booting</a>
that describes a workaround, and how to fix this if it happens
(the bottom line is a single command, "sfdisk -d /dev/hda | sfdisk --no-reread -H255 /dev/hda", change hda to whatever your boot drive is in the rare case where it's different).
For the few for whom that doesn't work, change the BIOS setting for the drive
from CHS or AUTO into LBA (and if that doesn't work, HUGE)
(this is per reports from Fedora; don't switch from HUGE to LBA though).
<a href="http://www.geocities.com/epark/linux/grub-w2k-HOWTO.html">The
GRUB W2K HOWTO</a> have more technical information.
This is a nasty problem, but it's easily fixed, so don't panic.
I expect the next releases will fix this problem so you don't have to do this,
but it's worth noting for the mid-2004 users.

The Linux kernel developers have a controversial policy: All kernel drivers
are part of the kernel, and the interface between drivers and the rest of
the kernel can be changed at any time
(see the
<a href="http://lxr.linux.no/source/Documentation/stable_api_nonsense.txt">
stable API nonsense document</a> for more information).
Well, it's actually not controversial to the Linux kernel developers;
it's controversial to proprietary driver developers and
the microkernel community.
The Linux kernel developers don't want to be stuck with an unchangeable
interface; it often needs to be changed.
The main reason to do otherwise would be to support proprietary drivers, but
proprietary drivers can't be fixed by the kernel developers, so for
reliability's sake it's better to inhibit their use.
Those who do the work should have the right to decide their rules, but there's
some evidence that this is actually sensible.
First of all, there's the evidence that a vast number of Windows crashes
are actually because of buggy drivers; Linux reliability numbers
are far greater, suggesting that their approach is producing less buggy
drivers.
(Microsoft has developed many tools that try to compensate.)
But here's another source suggesting this isn't insane... X Windows.
<a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/218380/">Keith Packard's comments
about X Windows</a> noted that the "policy of splitting the X drivers from the core server has not worked as well as they would have liked. It adds a whole set of API compatibility issues between the two, making it hard to develop and release improved versions of the server. Keith now thinks that the Linux kernel developers got it right by keeping drivers inside the kernel."
Now I do think that the microkernel folks <i>do</i> have a point -
there's no need for drivers to have unregulated control over everything.
But that doesn't require fixed interfaces; a simple language that specified
"what access rights are needed", that was enforced when running a driver,
would suffice.

<a href="http://blogs.sun.com/roller/page/dancer/20050316#just_switch_open_standards_make">here's a list of word processing products supporting OpenDocument</a>:
StarOffice and OpenOffice.org, KOffice,
Software GmbH's TextMaker
(who asked "is anyone using Microsoft Office XML for anything?"),
AbiWord, and
IBM's Workplace Client Technology.
OpenOffice.org and StarOffice include import/export filters for
Microsoft's .doc and Corel's Word Perfect formats, so they can
be used to transition between them.
<a href="http://www.jroller.com/page/rgardler/20050315#ms_office_xml_vs_ooo">
Ross Gardler (of the Apache Forrest project) has other notes
about the OpenDocument project, including that it's a terrible format</a> -
he notes that the Apache Forrest project has plugins
for using OpenOffice documents as input to the Forrest processing pipelines,
He also reports that OpenDocument's main competitor,
Microsoft's "Office XML", it a terrible format:
"the Burrokeet project [found that it's] easier to use OOo as
a headless server that can convert MS Office to OOo format
and then work with the OOo XML files...".
In contrast, Ferdinand Soethe said,
"I'm impressed how easy it is to work with oo-xml".
Although they started to work with MS XML, it appears they plan to
deprecate that work, and switch entirely to using just OpenDocument.
<a href="http://www.onlamp.com/pub/wlg/6649">
Simon St. Laurent says Office XML
is an alpha release</a>; "the structure of what you get is amazingly twisted,
and it's painfully obvious that WordprocessingML
(formerly the catchier WordML) is a serialization of
internal structures in Word, not an XML vocabulary designed by
people who actually care about working with XML."
Gardler agreed wholeheartedly.

OpenOffice.org is already much better than Microsoft Word for large
academic works, for at least two reasons.
First, it has a working master document capability.
Second, it has much better support for complicated bibliographies
and references (it uses a database for the references, so
you can auto-generate the bibliography with the right format).
This work has been the result of the

a nifty Linux filesystem. It's a
stackable unification file system, which can appear to merge the
contents of several directories (branches),
while keeping their physical content separate.
Unionfs is useful for unified source tree management,
merged contents of split CD-ROM,
merged separate software package directories, data grids, and more.
Unionfs allows any mix of read-only and read-write branches,
as well as insertion and deletion of branches anywhere in the fan-out.

Here are some useful guidelines when using git, particularly about
rebasing (which <i>should</i> be used in some cases, and should
<i>not</i> be used in others):
<ol>
<li>
<a href="http://codicesoftware.blogspot.com/2010/11/linus-on-branching.html">
Create branches ONLY from a stable, well-known point!</a>
Don't just download the latest version and start patching.
<li>
<a href="http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/user-manual.html#problems-With-rewriting-history">Never rewrite published branches</a>.
<li>
<a href="http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/user-manual.html#bisect-merges">Many experienced git users... keep the history linear by rebasing against the latest upstream version before publishing</a>
(because it makes bisecting easier).
But once your branch has been published to others, the rules change:
<a href="http://progit.org/book/ch3-6.html">
Do not rebase commits that you have pushed to a public repository</a>.
As <a href="http://progit.org/book/">Pro Git</a> explains,
"If you treat rebasing as a way to clean up and work with commits
before you push them, and if you only rebase commits that have never
been available publicly, then you’ll be fine. If you rebase commits
that have already been pushed publicly, and people may have based work
on those commits, then you may be in for some frustrating trouble."
<li>
<a href="http://kerneltrap.org/Linux/Git_Management">Linus Torvalds discussed rebasing topic branches in 2008</a>.
He stated that "Rebasing branches is absolutely not a bad thing for individual developers....  if you're a 'random developer' and
you're never going to have anybody really pull from you and you
*definitely* don't want to pull from other peoples (except the ones that
you consider to be "strictly upstream" from you!), then you should often
plan on keeping your own set of patches as a nice linear regression.
And the best way to do that is very much by rebasing them...
for that end-point-developer situation "git rebase" is absolutely the
right thing to do."
<i>But in contrast</i>, rebasing
"<b>*is*</b> a bad thing for a subsystem maintainer."

OpenOffice.org (OOo) is amazingly compatible with Microsoft Office.
When there's a Windows/Linux problem, I've found that often the
real problem are missing fonts, not the program itself.
Both programs will substitute other fonts for missing fonts, but
the other fonts have different sizes and the results are often
disappointing.
Fonts are unfortunately a complicated subject.
<a href="http://avi.alkalay.net/linux/docs/font-howto/Font.html">Optimal Use of Fonts on Linux</a> explains much for Linux users.
If you're using OpenOffice.org, and want to avoid proprietary fonts,
the Bitstream Vera package seems to be the way to go;
all OpenOffice.org installations have this font, and
<a href="http://www.gnome.org/fonts/">
the Bitstream Vera fonts can be freely shared, modified, and
redistributed.</a>
If you want
maximum portability with Windows users who use Microsoft Office, use
a Microsoft font, since those are the only fonts that you can be sure
they'll have.
You can arbitrarily install the
<a href="http://avi.alkalay.net/linux/docs/font-howto/Font.html#msfonts">
Microsoft fonts package</a>
on other systems
and then use Arial, Times New Roman, Verdana, Tahoma, and LucidaTypewriter;
however, their license apparantly makes it not possible for for-pay
distributions to include them directly (you have to install them separately,
which thankfully is easy to do).
Here's a source for
<a href="http://corefonts.sourceforge.net/">
Microsoft's True Type core fonts on Linux</a>, and
<a href="http://www.mjmwired.net/resources/mjm-fedora-fc3.shtml#ttf">

The major label music cartel complains that everyone should pay
extreme amounts of money because the artists need to get paid.
Well yes, it's a good idea to pay the artists.
But many of the cartel's statements appear to be lies as well, in particular,
they often keep all the money instead of actually paying artists.

Steve Albini's essay
"Major Labels: The problem with music"</a>
(<a href="http://www.negativland.com/albini.html">alternate site</a>)
has <i>way</i> too much swearing, but it has a valid point.
<a href="http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20110707/03264014993/riaa-accounting-how-to-sell-1-million-albums-still-owe-500000.shtml">
RIAA Accounting: How To Sell 1 Million Albums And Still Owe $500,000</a>
makes the same point.
And the point is... the major labels make sure that music artists
never get (really) paid, through a long list of unethical practices.
It's often a modern (and legal) form of slavery.
No wonder so many artists are willing to give their music away,
or don't care if their music is copied ... they make about as much either way,
and more people hear hear their work if it's copied at no fee.
What's more, freely-available music is getting increasingly better way as a
way to noticed, and unlike label deals, the artists are free from slavery
to the label.
<a href="http://www.groklaw.net/article.php?story=20080811180231923">The
Indie Band Survival Guide</a> discusses an alternative.
The fights between RIAA/MPAA and file sharing networks that encourage piracy,
(like Grokster) make me feel really uncomfortable; it's
more like watching two thieves in battle.
I do not like systems like Grokster's, but I'm unable to
side with RIAA/MPAA (who may act legally, since they've purchased the law,
but they don't act ethically).
What's really needed is for the cartels to actually provide what consumers
want -- music they can easily download and <i>own</i>.
By own, I mean it's not just rent (if you stop paying you keep your music),
and you can use it with <i>all</i> the devices you own
(so you can listen to it on your various devices, including
a patent-free Linux system).
If you buy a player from vendor V, you should be able to place the songs
you own onto that player... even if it's a different vendor.
Formats that require you to pay a monthly fee to keep using your music
are not okay, because that fee will keep escalating once everyone's locked
into it.
Formats that lock music to a particular device, and try to make sure
that you can't share your music among all the devices you own, are
unacceptable; people buy new devices all the time.
Apple's iTunes has historically locked you into their products;
many people avoid them
for that reason, and there will be a lot of unhappy people in the future
when they find out that they have to keep re-buying their music.
(That's changing recently, thankfully.)
They won't do it -- they'll "pirate" the songs they already paid for instead.
It's time for the music industry to provide what customers actually
want; the fact that piracy networks keep springing up is a wake-up call
that they are failing to provide what customers actually want.
Sure, you can use prohibition-era tactics, but wouldn't it be better to
sell the music instead, in the forms the customers actually want?

Need a MUD client?
Telnet obviously works, but why stay there?
If you want a basic console-type MUD client with a few extras
(triggers and such), there are lots of nice clients.
Indeed, for tty-style MUD client, there is an embarrassment of riches.
<a href="http://tf.tcp.com/~hawkeye/tf/">TinyFugue</a> is an old
tried-and-true favorite for the console crowd; you need to compile it on
some systems, which is no problem for me but others will want a nicely
prepackaged program.
There are many GUI-based MUD clients with lots of features (and users).
Highly-rated ones (according to Freshmeat) include
<a href="http://dw.nl.eu.org/mudix.html">gMUDix</a>,
<a href="http://kildclient.sourceforge.net/">Kildclient</a>
(version 2.0 was July 27, 2005),
<a href="http://www.kmuddy.net/">KMuddy</a>, and
<a href="http://kmc.sourceforge.net/">kmc</a>.
Some clients have problems;
<a href="http://www.kmud.de/">KMud</a> has some nice features, but depends
on an archaic version of Qt (a problem for modern systems), and development
halted long ago;
<a href="http://www.gtk-papaya.org/">Papaya</a> might be nice,
but at least as of July 2005 it won't install from source on Fedora Core 3.
<p>
But I wanted a MUD client with automapping, and that seems to be trickier.
The well-rated ones I listed earlier have lots of features,
but they do not have automapping.
I use Fedora Core usually, so I went hunting and here's what I found.
One worth trying is <a href="http://www.mudmagic.com/mud-client/">MUD Magic</a>;
it's easy to install on the Fedora Core distribution for Linux,
as long as you first install
<a href="http://rpmfind.net/linux/RPM/dag/fedora/2/i386/sqlite-2.8.16-1.1.fc2.rf.i386.html">sqlite (SQL lite library) for Fedora Core</a>;
<a href="http://download.fedora.redhat.com/pub/fedora/linux/extras/3/i386/">
sqlite is part of the "extras" in Fedora Core 3.</a>
Its user interface frankly isn't all that intuitive; you really have to hunt
to change font size, the opening commands aren't obvious, etc.
Still, it has some nice functions... and it <i>does</i> have an automapper.
MUD Magic's automapper plug-in is terrible, though.
The automapper gets trivially confused (if you give a direction it "maps"
even if the MUD responds you can't move that way),
editing maps essentially doesn't work,
and it often hangs or loses its mapping work.
Note that if you're invoking MUD Magic through a GUI, it's placed in the
"Network" (Internet) group, not in the games group.
There seems to be some convergence going on;
Tomas Mecir (author of KMuddy) and Mart Raudsepp (current lead for wxMUD)
have contributed to MUD Magic.
<p>
But I've had even less joy with alternatives.
<a href="http://amcl.sourceforge.net/">Gnome-MUD (aka amcl)</a>
looks like it might be useful, but I had trouble getting it to run
on Fedora Core 3 (it compiles, but doesn't run for some reason);
it appears development has stopped, too.
I've compiled it with: <pre>./configure --prefix=/usr</pre>,
as is usual on Fedora Core boxes.
Then make, as usual.
The "make install" takes forever to update the documentation
(for scrollkeeper).
Running the program
(it's at /usr/games/gnome-mud) just fails with the message:
"The default configuration values could not be retrieved correctly.
Please check your GConf configuration, specifically that the schemas have been installed correctly."

is older, but has reasonable ratings and has an automapper (see
<a href="http://freshmeat.net/projects/smmmudclient/">Freshmeat's entry
for SMM++ MUD client</a>).
But this is an absolute monster to install -- I haven't succeeded, and
others have had trouble too.
The problem is that it depends on really old stuff that has radically changed,
and SMM++ hasn't been changed to follow suit.
It depends on <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/incrtcl">itcl</a>,
which on Fedora Core is a real pain to install (why it's not included, I don't
know; it used to be).
Even worse, it particularly depends on "itkwish", which is no
longer part of itcl.
(so you have to install a version of itcl that has itkwish;
many do not.)

You work to install itcl, but it's a pain.
You have to first install tcl-devel and tk-devel, but that's easy:
"yum install tcl-devel tk-devel". Then
itcl's installation on Fedora Core requires that you do this:
<pre>"./configure --prefix=/usr --with-tcl=/usr/lib --with-tk=/usr/lib"</pre>
but even that's not enough.
I abandoned this after a while -- not worth it.

It appears that you <i>can</i> get fired for choosing Microsoft.
<a href="http://humorix.org/articles/1998/07/fired/">
Jesse Burst reported on July 25, 1998 about one person who <i>was</i>
fired for choosing Microsoft.</a>
about one person (Scott Barker, of Proctor and Gamble),
who went to a Microsoft-sponsored workshop and
because of that decided to replace the company mainframe
with Microsoft Windows systems.
That cost $1.5 million just for the initial software purchase.
His boss, Matt Kiyuck, then found about Linux, and
"realized that we could have saved millions of dollars
in new software and hardware if we had gone with Linux instead of NT.
Needless to say, Scott Barker received a pink slip the next day."
The moral seems to be: If you're making decisions with big ramifications,
make sure you consider all your options.
Don't just buy a product because many other people use it, or
because they seem very nice in their workshop.
Frankly, as described it makes sense; if someone's job is to carefully make
a major multi-million dollar decision, and they don't consider their options,
they <i>do</i> deserve to be fired.
The source here is a little suspect; they often run humor articles.
Yet it's not clear they're kidding in this case; the identification
of particular people and organizations (by name) is usually not done
with made-up articles. I'd love to confirm or deny this story.

<p>
<a href="http://www.drunkenblog.com.nyud.net:8090/drunkenblog-archives/000534.html">Drunkenblog has a lengthy discussion justifying the claim that
Maui X-Stream has illegally copied code into its products.</a>
The author claims that since GPL'ed code is often given away, then
there must only a civil case.
I doubt that; many people use the LGPL and GPL licenses because they
expect to be able to see and use the source code
of any publicly-released improvements.
Since a proprietary program doesn't release its source, I suspect
an author of a GPL program could sue for the value of all improvments
made to the program, but illegally witheld, as well as the money
acquired from sales and the legal costs of the suit.
You can use programs like
<a href="https://dwheeler.com/sloccount">SLOCCount</a> to estimate costs.
When a small GPL program is inadvertently included in a big program,
it's usually worked out amicably, but when a vendor intentionally tries to
defraud the world, the vendor should expect to get in trouble.

The audio format Ogg Vorbis appears to be gaining ground.
<a href="http://blogs.zdnet.com/ITFacts/?p=8641">A CacheLogic survey</a>
found that 61.44% of current peer-to-peer traffic is video,
11.34% is audio, and 27.22% belongs to other category.
Of the audio, 65% (by traffic volume) are traded
in the MP3 format, and 12.3% are in the open-source OGG file format.
I don't know how much of that is illegal, and I don't condone any that's
illegal.  But clearly Ogg Vorbis (Ogg'd primary audio format)
use is increasing from the near-0% of years past.

<a href="http://citeseer.ist.pseu.edu/online-nature01">Online or Invisible?
by Steve Lawrence</a> make a critical point: "Articles freely available
online are more highly cited. For greater impact and
faster scientific progress, authors and publishers should aim to make
research easy to access."
Unfortunately, many academic organizations are still stuck in the stone
age, trying to charge for articles and thus make money on stuff
they didn't write and don't pay the authors for.
It's time to stop.
If the problem is that you need money to pay for printing the documents
on paper, then the solution is obvious: stop printing them on paper.
Almost no one wants them on paper any more; they want the electrons.
If your goal is to make free money by exploiting
other people's work, while not paying them and not providing a critically
valuable service that you pay for, that's frankly unethical. Stop.
(Having unpaid people peer review the article obviously doesn't count
as a service -- you're not paying them either!)
That doesn't mean all written works should be free; I very much believe in
authors getting paid for their work.  But then make sure the authors
get paid for their work; generally authors of
academic papers don't get royalties or other real payment from their article.
If the authors aren't getting paid for their work, then it makes no
sense for there to be a charge. There's simply no need for the
paper mill infrastructure anymore in academic works.
If someone wants a paper version, let them
download and print it in the way that's best for them.
It's time to get almost all academic works freely available on the Internet.

The term "to betamax" is interesting.
It seems to have been making the verbal rounds for a while, but
tracking it down in written records is tricky.
AlistairMcMillan re-added this snippet to the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Betamax">
Wikipedia article on Betamax</a> on October 7, 2005:
"The VHS format's defeat of the Betamax format became a classic marketing
case study, now identified with the verbal phrase 'to Betamax' ,
wherein a [[proprietary]] technology format is overwhelmed in
the market by a format allowing multiple, competing,
licensed manufacturers, as in: 'Apple Betamaxed themselves out
of the PC (Personal computer) market.'
Sony's confidence in its ability to dictate the
industry standard backfired when JVC made the tactical decision
to engage in open sharing of its VHS technology.
JVC sacrificed substantial potential earnings by going the open
sharing route, but that decision ultimately won the standards war.
By 1984, forty companies utilized the VHS format in
comparison with Betamax's twelve.
Sony finally conceded defeat in 1988 when it
too began producing VHS recorders."
But it doesn't seem to have originated then; copies of the
article from April 2004 had this text snippet.

"No vaccinations until a child is two years old
(except hepatitis B vaccine for infants whose mothers test
positive for this disease);
No vaccines that contain thimerosal (mercury) (including flu);
No live virus vaccines (except for smallpox, should it recur);
and these vaccines, to be given one at a time, every six months,
beginning at age 2: Pertussis (acellular, not whole cell),
Diphtheria, Tetanus, d. Polio (the Salk vaccine, cultured in human cells)."

SourceForge.net supports the subversion SCM system, but don't
clearly explain how to get a new project started.  First, you need to enable
the use of subversion at all for your project.
Then, for each developer, you need to give them write access.
Finally, you need to import some initial files; they explain how to export
from CVS, but not how to initialize a new project.
You need to use "import", and you need to specify that you're importing to
the trunk.
For example, to create a subdirectory with your initial files (let's call it "readable") and put it in the trunk of the "readable" project, do this:
<pre>
 svn import -m "Initial import" readable https://svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/readable/trunk

<a href="http://emshort.wordpress.com/2009/01/01/geekiness/">a large
chart of rules, showing how Inform 7 works</a>.

<p>
Currently neither Inform 7 nor TADS3 are open source software
(they are available at no cost, but cannot be independently modified
among other things).
If you want an OSS tool for developing interactive fiction, Inform 6
is quite useful
(in spite of its name, it's actively maintained).

<p>
An interesting tool for telling interactive stories is
<a href="http://twinery.org/">Twine</a> - this one is fully OSS,
and is supposed to be especially easy to get started.
That said, Twine is really for "choose your own adventure" and
hypercard-like structures, not for interactive fiction.

There are some interesting "kids developing software" things.

"demonstrate the need for further research into virtualisation security
and prove that virtualisation is no security panacea", because
"No virtual machine tested was robust enough to withstand
the testing procedure used, and multiple exploitable ﬂaws
were presented that could allow an attacker restricted to a vir-

The "Vista" version of Microsoft Windows has some
really serious compatibility problems, and frankly there seems to be no
real business case for upgrading.
Essentially nobody buys Windows because
it's a great operating system - frankly, it isn't.
The only reason anyone uses Windows is because they want to use applications
that require it.
And <i>way</i> too many programs fail to run in Vista...
<i>whole categories</i> of applications don't work correctly.
A bug in
<a href="http://www.trnicely.net/misc/vista.html">
Windows Vista restricts all applications compiled by GNU GCC (one of the
most popular development environments) to 32 MB</a>.
<a href="http://www.cratchit.org/blog/2007/04/vista-incompatibilities-hitting-home.html">Programs developed using FoxPro (another common development system),
such as SBT Database Accounting, won't work at all under Vista</a>.
<a href="http://www.groklaw.net/article.php?story=20070422083715451">
Burning DVDs and CD-ROMs is hard to do, often fails, and it's difficult
to make it generate standards-compliant disks
that <i>anyone</i> can read - and Vista's lousy UI is concerning</a>.
Many existing programs can't run, or require an expensive upgrade to run
on Vista, such as
<a href="http://ezinearticles.com/?QuickBooks-and-the-Vista-Operating-System---What-QuickBooks-Users-Need-to-Know&amp;id=331771">Quickbooks</a>.
<a href="http://news.zdnet.com/2100-1009_22-6166868.html">Many U.S.
government agencies are temporarily forbidding use of Vista</a> because of
these problems.
Vista <i>hopefully</i> has better security than XP, but frankly, that's a
dismally low bar... and since everyone (including Microsoft) expects to
see a number of vulnerabilities in Vista, it's more a count than a full
release from security problems.
The
<a href="http://blogs.zdnet.com/security/?p=191">May 8, 2007 patch
Tuesday release alone had 6 critical vulnerabilities.</a>
And Vista raises its own security problems; it's incompatible with many
security products, and has far more DRM mechanisms.
By design, DRM mechanisms prevent users from controlling their own equipment,
and thus DRM mechanisms always reduce user security
(Microsoft sidesteps this by talking about "security" without answering the
question of "security for who?").
The large number of incompatibilities are especially concerning; hopefully
things will get better quickly.
But it looks like waiting a while before getting or using Vista would be
a good idea; it's what many government agencies are doing.

http://www.livescience.com/health/080320-clueless-guys.html

http://www.psychologicalscience.org/journals/ps/19_4_inpress/Farris.pdf

Males are apparently clueless when it comes to interpreting sexual intent from females, according to a recent study (PDF) from Indiana University's Department of Psychological and Brain Sciences. Men were found commonly to perceive more sexual intent in women's behavior than women were intending to convey. (A campus survey showed that 68% of college females had an experience where a male mistook signs of friendliness for affection.) However, the study also shows that men were quite likely to misperceive sexual interest as friendliness. 'Rather than seeing the world through sex-colored glasses, men seemed just to have blurry vision of sorts, overall,' according to the article. If you're a male who ever mistook the meaning of a barista's smile, looks like you're not alone."

MS Windows' development interfaces, including the problems of .NET.
Java and C# aren't that radically different as languages, but
as he notes,
"The .NET library is simple to the point of being totally dumbed down;
it's probably okay for the first and second groups [who don't need
much capability], not least because they don't know any better,
but for the rest it's an exercise in frustration. This frustration is
exacerbated when it's compared to .NET's big competitor, Java.
Java is no panacea; it too is aiming roughly at the middle kind of developer,
which is understandable, as they're the most numerous.
But Java's much more high-minded. It's much stronger on concepts,
making it easier to learn. Sun doesn't get it right the whole time,
but the people behind Java have clearly made something of an effort."
He concludes with:
"I enjoy writing programs, but I don't enjoy writing for Windows.
And while once it made sense to stick with Windows, it just doesn't any more."

"Techniques for Cyber Attack Attribution"
by David A. Wheeler
(Oct 2003)
summarizes various techniques to perform attribution
(aka traceback or source tracking) on networks, esp. TCP/IP networks.</a>
Here's the abstract:
"This paper summarizes various techniques to perform attribution of computer attackers who are exploiting data networks. Attribution can be defined as determining the identity or location of an attacker or an attacker's intermediary. In the public literature "traceback" or "source tracking" are often used as terms instead of "attribution." This paper is intended for use by the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) as it considers if it should improve its attribution capability, and if so, how to do so. However, since the focus of this paper is on technology, it may also be of use to many others such as law enforcement personnel. This is a technical report, and assumes that the reader understands the basics of network technology, especially the Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) suite of protocols."

Here is
<a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/PackageMaintainers/CreatingPackageHowTo">
how to create RPM packages for Fedora</a>.

<p>
<!--
Fedora (and many other Linux distros) use RPM.  The key thing is to write a ".spec" file that give info about the program, how to build it, and how to install it.

Basic parable on the process, with key references:
http://www.redhatmagazine.com/2008/02/28/when-sally-met-eddie-the-fedora-package-story/

Here's a quick introduction (mainly how to set up your account and use existing .spec files):
http://www.g-loaded.eu/2006/04/05/how-to-build-rpm-packages-on-fedora/

But that doesn't show how to _write_ new .spec files, which is the heart of the matter.

Here's a sample .spec file (usually you'd name it PROGRAMNAME.spec, and put it in the SPECS subdirectory):
http://docs.fedoraproject.org/developers-guide/ch-rpm-building.html

And here's some useful details on making and using spec files:
http://docs.fedoraproject.org/drafts/rpm-guide-en/ch-creating-rpms.html

You'll need to follow packaging guidelines:
http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/PackageMaintainers
http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Packaging/Guidelines


You may find this recipe collection useful:
http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Packaging/ScriptletSnippets


That should do it.   If you really want hairy details, you can consult http://www.rpm.org/max-rpm-snapshot/ but it's very out-of-date.



My paper here lists lots of formal methods tools and their URLs:
https://dwheeler.com/essays/high-assurance-floss.html

Ones of special importance to me are:
Prover9
 - Has a text interface, and a separate GUI.  The GUI
 should be in a separate package.  The text interface component
 is really small and should be easy to package, so that might be
 a good place to start.
Coq
Why / Caduceus / Krakatoa
 All implemented in OCaml.
 Caduceus and Krakatoa build on top of Why.  Why, in turn, can call lots
 of other things.. we just need to make sure that at least one of the
 kinds of things it needs are around.
 Note: These can use PVS or Coq, usually Coq.
 They can use a number of different lower-level theorem provers, need to
 include at least one OSS one they can use.  They can also use "SIMPLE",
 but SIMPLE's licensing situation is really nasty and I doubt that
 Fedora would be willing to include it.


HIGHLY desirable:
Alloy
ACL2
 - Uses Common Lisp.  Pick a CL that works.
PVS
 - Uses Common Lisp. Pick a CL that works.
BLAST
  [Note: don't go to BSD, use http://mtc.epfl.ch/software-tools/blast/]


Desirable:
 HOL 4
 Isabelle
 HOL Lite
 Gandalf
 NuSMV
 DiVinE

Towards a normative quality standard
(31 March 2007)</a>
gives a pitch for using the same measures that have been
applied to proprietary software.
It notes ISO 9126, which breaks measures into
functionality (inc. security), reliability, usability, efficiency,
maintainability, and portability.
It also suggests using
"Simple, language independent metrics that influence maintainability".
Of course, they can't fix the main problem with measures
in software: You can typically either
identify high-level measures that you want (but can't actually measure),
or identify low-level measures that can actually measure (but have
tenuous relationships to what you want).

For the latter one, I think the fundamental problem was the use of a
language (Python) that is hard to statically analyze.
In Python, you can't know what "f(x)" means in module A, because
in module B you might do "a.f = ..." and change its meaning.
Python has no static type system, either.
The author even noted that at least one of the 3 inserted bugs was
probably easy to find using static analysis, and I think all of them are
detectable.

Fedora has lots of security goodies, but they can sometimes prevent the
execution of programs not already part of its repository.
"setarch -R" is supposed to disable randomization per-process
(though there are claims that it sometimes doesn't work), and
"setarch i386" has a side-effect of disabling the parts of exec-shield
that may cause trouble.
Fedora 9's security policy forbids changing memory permissions in some
cases, which can wreak havoc.  The only easy solution is to disable that
globally; the clean solution would presumably be to create a new security
policy.

Unfortunately, many viewers find that when they switch to an HDTV they
are unable to view closed caption (CC) information, even though the
broadcaster is sending it and the TV is able to display it.
That's rediculous - there are millions of deaf and hard-of-hearing people,
and we have laws that were supposed to enable CC.
Originally,
CC information was included in the picture ("line 21"), but there is no
equivalent capability in the HDTV 720p/1080i interconnects between the
display and a "source". A "source", in this case, can be a DVD player
or an HD tuner (a cable box is an HD tuner). When CC information is
encoded in the MPEG-2 data stream, only the device that decodes the
MPEG-2 data (a source) has access to the closed caption information;
there is no standard for transmitting the CC information to an HD display
separately. Thus, if there is CC information, the source device needs
to overlay the CC information on the picture prior to transmitting to
the display over the interconnect. Unfortunately, many source devices
do not have the ability to overlay CC information, or controlling the
CC overlay is extremely complicated. For example, the Motorola DCT-5100
cable Set Top Box has the ability to decode CC information located on
the mpg stream and overlay it on the picture, but turning CC on and off
requires turning off the unit and going into a special setup menu (it is
not on the standard configuration menu and it cannot be controlled using
the remote). Historically, DVD players and cable box tuners did not need
to do this overlaying, they simply passed this information on to the TV,
and they are not mandated to perform this overlaying. Many modern HDTVs
can be directly connected to cables, but then they often cannot receive
scrambled channels that the user is paying for. Thus, the lack of a
standard way of sending CC information between components, along with
the lack of a mandate to add this information to a picture, results in
CC being unavailable to many hard-of-hearing and deaf users.

"The Rosetta disk is not digital. The pages are analog 'human-readable'

DVD playing on Linux systems
requires that it have a program that can read the "CSS" format.
The DVD cartel claims that running a program (like deCSS) that they didn't
approve of, to watch movies you own, is illegal... but I can't see
what legal theory justifies their claim.
There seems to be no patent problem in doing so (at least, I can't find
any claim with patent number in doing so).
Copyright doesn't apply when someone indepedently writes the program
(like deCSS was written).
Their claim about "decryption" is sheer nonsense;
if it's legal to watch a DVD using program #1 on your laptop, then
clearly it's legal to watch it using program #2, right?
Their nonsense about "copy protection" was even sillier;
CSS doesn't prevent copying at all
(you can copy bits without decrypting them, as large-scale pirates do).
Early court decisions seem to have followed the DVD cartel's hysteria.
But more recently,
<a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/3341211.stm">Norway

There are lots of FLOSS HTML editors; I usually edit with vim, but
if I want a more capable HTML editor, I usually use Seamonkey.
I looked at several before deciding on this:
<ul>
<li>Seamonkey.  This is the older Mozilla, which includes an HTML editor
(Composer).
This works really well - it's WYSIWYG (great for ordinary text), and
it doesn't insert lots of unnecessary HTML junk.
It does insert a few things, but they're justifiable
(e.g., it inserts closing &lt;/p&gt; to match opening tags).
It often leaves lines alone, which is nice when "diff"ing HTML files.
It "just works"; I like it!!
Its cursor occasionally disappears from view, which is annoying, but
it returns to view after a moment (or a restart).
To tell it to edit a local file, the first character must be "/"
(it unfortunately doesn't realize that a leading "." is also a local file).
So, you can invoke it from the command line in Unix/Linux like this:
<pre>
   seamonkey -edit `pwd`/MYFILE.html
</pre>
<li>OpenOffice.org includes an HTML editor.
Its user interface is nice for ordinary text - it's simply an ordinary
word processor interfaces.
In addition, you don't have to install anything if you
already have OpenOffice.org.
However, the generated HTML isn't so nice;
all tags are forced to uppercase (e.g., BODY), which is not only ugly, but it's
a poor choice since XHTML requires <i>lowercase</i> tags.
It also inserts "attribute junk" (e.g., extra attributes in each
paragraph tag).
<li>Firefox extension firebug. Easily installed.
It displays as either straight XML, or as syntax-highlighted
tabbed XML... which is great for complex XML, but not good for simple essays.
The output HTML at least uses lowercase tags.
It inserts lots of HTML junk at the beginning, though.
It also inserts "attribute junk" (e.g., extra attributes in each paragraph tag).
Yuk.
<li>Amaya (W3C). Fedora used to have a package, but doesn't now.
The Amaya project seems to be vigorous (it's not clear it used to be), so I
wish they'd repackage it.
<li>Nvu/KompoZer.  Abandoned.
<li>Quanta plus.  On Fedora, part of the kdewebdev package.
Note that this requires installation of the KDE infrastructure.
<li>Bluefish is primarily a syntax-highlighting text editor, focused on HTML.
<li>Most text editors (vim, emacs, gedit, etc.) include extras for editing HTML.
</ul>

Python 3 is incompatible with Python 2.
Discussions such as
<a href="http://www.linux-archive.org/fedora-development/206244-looming-python-3-000-monster.html">Looming Python 3000 Monster</a>
note that the big problem for distributions is that there are
<i>lots</i> of Python libraries - so a distributor in theory
would have to carry both Python 2 and Python 3 versions
of everything. Ugh.
The program 2to3 tries to convert Python 2 to Python 3, but
has to punt often.
That's the official way to convert, but for many, a gradual
transition using Python 2 (but increasingly using Python 3
capabilities) is probably easier.
You can try to stay with code that's easy to (later)
convert to Python 3, especially with
"import from __future__" statements and judicious renames.
Python 2.6 in particular has lots of capabilities from Python 3.
It may take a long time for Python 2.6 to promulgate everywhere,
but it will happen over time.

If you're writing in (Bourne) shell, and you want your code to be
truly portable across many shell implementations, take a peek at
<a href="http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/009695399/utilities/xcu_chap02.html">Open Group's Base Specifications for the shell</a>, along with the
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf/manual/html_node/Portable-Shell.html#Portable-Shell">portable shell guidelines from the GNU autoconf
documentation</a>.
Lots of good information on stuff that works and stuff to avoid.
You <i>can</i> simply write for the bash shell, but in that case,
make sure the header clearly runs the bash shell - don't assume that
/bin/sh is bash!
Programming in the shell is generally easy; the big problem is that it's
easy to write code that works unless its data (e.g., filenames) have
spaces in them.  If a variable can include a space, you typically need
to refer to it using <tt>"$variablename"</tt>, not just <tt>$variablename</tt>.
If you want to run a command (mycommand) and pass it a parameter
"--filename" with the value of variable $x, but only if $x was set,
do something like this:
<tt>mycommand ${x:+--filename "$x"}</tt> - the "${NAME:+...}" to do it.
This means that the
whole expression disappears if variable NAME isn't set, otherwise, the
text after "+" is substituted.
The most important rule for shell programming is "use shellcheck";
it's an OSS tool that notices lots of common mistakes and can be a huge help.
<a href="http://www.davidpashley.com/articles/writing-robust-shell-scripts.html">Writing robust shell scripts</a> has some other suggestions, and

Programming languages like Python are not reasonable substitutes for shell;
it's way too complicated and takes too many lines to invoke
lots of other commands (which is what shell is all about).
A few options can help remove some of the biggest problems; simply adding
"set -eu" to the beginning of a script is 100% portable.
Aaron Maxwell's
<a href="http://redsymbol.net/articles/unofficial-bash-strict-mode/">Use Bash Strict Mode (Unless You Love Debugging)</a>
argues for the following in bash as an "unofficial bash strict mode":
<pre>
set -euo pipefail
IFS=$'\n\t'
</pre>

<p>
Shell works differently than many other programming languages.
The biggest oddity is needing to put double-quotes around everything.
One cause for that is the field separator (IFS), which is a weird mechanism
to compensate for the lack of arrays in standard shell.
You can easily turn off field separators (just set IFS=''),
but in simple shells like dash that don't have arrays, I think that's a pain.
Also, that doesn't deal with "myfunc $one $two $three"; if $two is
empty, it's quietly removed if you don't quote it.
That may be okay, e.g.,
binary.phile says that one approach is to remember that
<a href="http://www.binaryphile.com/bash/2018/09/01/approach-bash-like-a-developer-part-19-disabling-word-splitting.html">"where a variable may legitimately expand to an empty string, and to quote those occasions only"</a>.

<p>
If you don't like the way that "traditional" shell works,
a bigger alternative is to use options to make it work
"more like other languages".
One approach is here, which accepts bash's extensions and makes it
work more like "traditional" systems:
<a href="http://www.binaryphile.com/bash/2018/07/26/approach-bash-like-a-developer-part-1-intro.html">Approach Bash Like a Developer</a>
The oil shell creates its own language; I don't know if that will
go anywhere, but it (and shellcheck errors) might be a good source for
ideas on "how to make the shell language easier".
Implementing a new shell is one approach, but I wouldn't be suprised if
it'd be easier to add extensions to existing shells
(ideally with specific semantics so that all shells could implement them
in the same compatible way).
For example,
<a href="https://www.oilshell.org/blog/2019/08/22.html#toc_1">Oil Language
Design Notes</a> discusses some possible options.
It suggests shopt -s simple-word-eval,
an alternative word evaluation algorithm that means you don't have
to use double quotes everywhere because it disables word
splitting, empty elision, and dynamic globbing.
This focuses on using arrays instead of word splitting, but with that change
it's important to make arrays easier to use.
So he also proposes shopt -s parse-at so you can use @flags
to splice an array flags into a command, e.g. ls @flags ~/src. In addition,
"The push builtin appends one or more elements to an array, [and]
there's a new literal syntax for arrays, var myarray = @(bare words)."

<a href="http://www.linuxinsight.com/what-to-do-if-you-forget-root-password.html">You can easily reset the root password on Linux if you have physical
access (and the system is not configured to prevent it)</a>.
Basically, at LILO or grub boot, set the "init" option, like this:
<pre>
  linux init=/bin/sh rw ...
</pre>
If you forget the "rw" part, you can remount the filesystem to permit
editing, like this:
<pre>
  # mount -o remount,rw /
</pre>
Now use "passwd" to set the password:
<pre>
  # passwd
</pre>
After that, you should probably "sync ; sync ; sync".  You can
remount the filesystem as read-only using "mount -o remount,ro /",
but frankly you should probably just type "reboot now" and let the system
reboot cleanly.
Of course, none of this works if you can't change the reboot options;
if you set GRUB to forbid changes to the boot parameters, and
set the BIOS to forbid changing of the boot location (and make sure that
the disk is first), you'll need to take more drastic physical measures
(e.g., erase the BIOS settings or move the main storage unit
to another machine so you can control it).
Or, you'd need to break into the system in other ways, which hopefully
is non-trivial on an important machine.
The fact that it takes non-trivial effort or deeper knowledge
to do reset a root password on well-protected machines is a <i>good</i> thing.

Annoyances in using FAT32 in Linux - here's my comment:
http://hardware.slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=1364513&cid=29389631

What about reviving umsdos? At one time, Linux's "umsdos" filesystem was FAT plus extra "hidden" information that let you store file permissions, uid, etc. If I remember correctly, one annoyance was what to do about differing UID's. But this wouldn't be that hard to handle; a mount option could be added that made it appear that the user-mounter owned all the files (which is not bad model for a USB stick). That way, you could easily store and retrieve files with the correct execute permissions (no, I do NOT need to execute JPEGs), note which files are read-only, and so on.

Or, if reviving umsdos is too much, maybe there'd be a way to modify Linux so that its FATS32 implementation is "a little more useful". When exchanging files on a stick, I find that you often don't need exotic permission capabilities. The uid is often unnecessary, since it's a different computer anyway. Just noting which files are executable and which are writable by the owner is all that most people need on a stick. But NOT having those is incredibly annoying; it's stupid that JPEGs come out executable. FAT32 already has a "read only" bit for file attributes; basically, interpret that as the inverse of a write bit (make everything writeable unless it's read-only). For "executable", maybe you could use an "unused" file attribute bit or two (00=unknown/use some other method, 01=executable, 10=not executable, 11=???). An implementation that knew about the new bits would use them, otherwise, situation normal. Byte 0xc has 6 unused bytes, and we only need 2 for this scheme. You could steal a few more bits and at least implement "user" and "other" (and make "group=other"), or even implement all 9 traditional bits. I think most people could live without the sticky bit, or setuid, on FAT32 :-).

NTFS and "Universal Disk Format" may be the best you can do for now if you want to exchange files with permission info. But there are still many systems which can't read them well, so FAT32 ends up being the "easy" road. If you "zip" up the files first, almost everyone can read them (tar works, but most Windows users can't read tar files... they're more likely to be able to read zip files).

<a href="http://caniuse.com/#statuses=rec,pr,cr">Can I use</a> shows
that Internet Explorer is the <i>worst</i> of all desktop web browsers
in supporting HTML5.
As of May 2011, the current version of Internet Explorer (IE)
is 9.0, which cannot even run on widely-used Windows XP.
Older versions of Windows can only run older versions of IE, for example,
IE version 8.0 only supports 41% of HTML5.
Yet even when we only compare current versions, IE is not doing well.
IE version 9.0 only supports 77% of HTML5, compared to
92% (Firefox 4.0), 88% (Safari 5.0), 92% (Chrome 11.0), and 97% (Opera 11.1).
In the farther future Microsoft hopes to get IE 10.0 up to 81%, which is
worse than the <i>current</i> values for its desktop competitors.
To be fair, part of the problem is that support for some functions is
unknown.
I really hope that the

I've fiddled with Microsoft Sharepoint's Wiki implementation, and
I am <i>not</i> impressed.
My biggest gripe is that it does not graciously handle multi-person
edits (e.g., when two people try to simultaneously edit a page at the same
time), even though the whole point of a Wiki is to collaborate with others.
Multiple people can try to edit, and the first person to save "wins".
After that, anyone else who tries to save are told that someone else
saved before them, and they can go "back" to their submission page.
At that point, the "easy" solution is to just refresh and lose all their work.
The only alternative I found was to first cut-and-paste changes to some other
program (possibly losing information),
refresh the page, and then figure out how to re-incorporate the work.
Free programs like MediaWiki do better than this.
Sharepoint has a GUI that looks reasonable at first, though some operations
are clunky multi-step ones.
It supports per-person, per-page, per-wiki access controls,
and for some apps this could be nice.
But I've found that in practice, what's more important is recording and
handling of versions, and Sharepoint doesn't do so well.
Sharepoint does record versions, but I did not find an easy way to
compare arbitrary versions (only adjacent versions).
What's worse, if you delete a page, the entire history of that page
goes away too... so you cannot really rely on the history mechanism.
You can edit pages without using Internet Explorer, but it's hideous -
the GUI essentially goes away, and exposes the <i>really bad</i>
HTML that they use internally
(e.g., "div" divisions end in essentially random locations).
The screwed-up file format makes me suspect that as pages get long,
getting the formatting right could be really hard - it just doesn't
seem to put the endings in the right places, so stuff that you would
THINK are separate are subtly bound together
(sort of like "spooky action at a distance").
For trivial uses Sharepoint might work okay.
However, using sharepoint as a Wiki for larger collaborations
is hard to justify, especially given the price; in many areas the
free Wikis are way better.

Patches critical bug, exploitable because of add-on silently slipped into Firefox last February
</a>
by Gregg Keizer
(ComputerWorld, October 16, 2009 06:02 AM ET) reports that
"An add-on that Microsoft silently slipped into Mozilla's Firefox last February [2009] leaves the browser open to attack...
thanks to a Microsoft-made plug-in pushed to Firefox users eight months
ago in an update delivered via Windows Update".
The 'Windows Presentation Foundation' plug-in had an incredibly dangerous
vulnerability - it was a "browse-and-get-owned" situation.
Now, there's nothing wrong with Microsoft creating a plug-in for Firefox...
and while having a vulnerability isn't good, as long as it's accidental,
it happens.
But quietly slipping it in, and making it incredibly difficult to remove
(unlike other Firefox plug-ins), is absolutely <i>not</i> okay.

The provided NVIDIA drivers don't support 3D acceleration, leading
some users to reach for the proprietary NVIDIA Linux drivers.
But if you decide to install proprietary drivers,
you can easily get into problems.
The Linux world has a standard solution for drivers: Release the code
as open source software.
Otherwise, each upgrade (even ones <i>inside</i> a major release) can
create serious problems.
I have repeatedly told the NVIDIA people that keeping their drivers
proprietary is a serious <i>problem</i> for customers,
but NVIDIA is simply not interested in listening
to their customers.  So you end up with problems like this. Sigh.
The good news is that
<a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/366648/">the open source software

Philip K. Howard: Four ways to fix a broken legal system (TED)</a>
notes that our culture has changed - people no longer feel
free to act according to their best judgement, because
they are afraid of legal attack.
He recommends four ways to change this:
<ol>
<li>Judge law mainly by its effect on society,
not individual situations.
($60-$200 billion year are caused by defensive medicine.
The rules for due process in education cause paralysis &mdash;
teachers are spending up to half their time controlling their
classes, because fear of the law prevents them from
effectively doing controlling their classrooms.)
</li>
<li>
Trust in law is an essential condition of freedom.
Distrust skews behavior towards failure.
(Law carries the power of the state!)
(Edison: "We're don't have rules around here...
we're trying to accomplish something!")
</li>
<li>
Law must set boundaries protecting an open field of freedom,
not intercede in all disputes.
("We've forgotten this... people wade through law
all day long.")
</li>
<li>
To rebuild boundaries of freedom two changes are essential:
(1) Simplify the law (it has to be simple enough that
people can internalize it), and
(2) Restore authority to judges and officials to apply the law
("rehumanize the law, in accordance with reasonable norms").
</li>
</ol>
"Authority is essential to freedom...
Law is a human institution.
Responsibility is a human institution.
If teachers don't have authority to run the classroom,
to maintain order, everybody's learning suffers.
If the judge doesn't have authority to toss out
unreasonable claims,
then all of us go through the day looking over our shoulders...
a free society requires red lights and green lights."

Many people use C++ to implement programs, but this is definitely a
language where you can shoot yourself in feet you don't even have yet.

On a Linux system every disk partition has a unique identifier called the
UUID.
<a href="http://liquidat.wordpress.com/2007/10/15/short-tip-get-uuid-of-hard-disks/">this tip on UUIDs</a> shows that you can find the UUIDs
by running "blkid /dev/sda1" (replacing the parameter as desired)
or by doing "ls -l /dev/disk/by-uuid".
You can change the UUID using tunefs, e.g.:
<pre>
 uuidgen
 tune2fs /dev/hdaX -U numbergeneratedbyuuidgen
 vol_id /dev/hdaX

"The bright side of wrong" by Kathryn Schulz</a>

"[Mistakes are] a byproduct of all that’s best about us...
We get things wrong because we get things right...
inductive reasoning undergirds virtually all of human cognition...
[but] this intelligence comes at a cost: Our entire cognitive operating
system is fundamentally, unavoidably fallible. The distinctive thing
about inductive reasoning is that it generates conclusions that aren’t
necessarily true. They are, instead, probabilistically true — which
means they are possibly false. Because we reason inductively, we will
sometimes get things wrong...
it suggests that we should work with rather than against our
natural reasoning processes to try to prevent mistakes and mitigate
their consequences. This is doable."

Some people think that computer attacks can only be a nuisance, and
nothing more; I think they are grossly mistaken.
For example, take a look at
<a href="http://homeland.house.gov/SiteDocuments/20070425145307-82503.pdf">
O. Sami Saydjari's April 2007 testimony before the
House Committee on Homeland Security,
Subcommittee on Emerging Threats, Cybersecurity, and Science and Technology</a>
(Sami is president of the non-profit "Professionals for Cyber Defense"
and CEO of the Cyber Defense Agency, among other things).
He states that
"The US is vulnerable to a strategically crippling cyber
attack from nation-state-class adversaries. Cyber space primarily
controls our real-world critical assets and is as legitimate a part of
our territory as physical land, thus the government must provide for the
common defense of this new territory...
Imagine the lights in this room suddenly
go out, and we lose all power. We try to use our cell phones, but the
lines of communication are dead. We try to access the Internet with our
battery-powered laptops, but the Internet, too, is down. After a while,
we venture out into the streets to investigate if this power outage is
affecting more than just our building, and the power is indeed out as
far as the eye can see. A passer-by tells us the banks are closed and
the ATMs aren’t working. The streets are jammed because the traffic
lights are out, and people are trying to leave their workplaces en
masse. Day turns to night, but the power hasn’t returned. Radio
and TV stations aren’t broadcasting. The telephone and Internet
still aren’t working, so there’s no way to check in with loved
ones. After a long, restless night, morning comes, but we still don’t
have power or communication. People are beginning to panic, and local
law enforcement can’t restore order. As another day turns to night,
looting starts, and the traffic jams get worse. Word begins to spread
that the US has been attacked—not by a conventional weapon, but by a
cyber weapon. As a result, our national power grid, telecommunications,
and financial systems have been disrupted—worse yet, they won’t
be back in a few hours or days, but in months. The airports and train
stations have closed. Food production has ceased. The water supply is
rapidly deteriorating. Banks are closed so people’s life savings are
out of reach and worthless. The only things of value now are gasoline,
food and water, and firewood traded on the black market. We’ve gone
from being a superpower to a third-world nation practically overnight."
He simulated attacks in a project called "Dark Angel".

<p>
Rust's ownership and borrowing model counter many problems.
That said, the model can sometimes seem a little constraining.
For example, if you want to mutate a part of a container, and work with it
for a while, you have to grab the whole container - which can be a problem
if you want to mutate multiple parts.
One solution is to swap out portions, which you can then work on separately,
and then put them back, because Rust includes mechanisms to safely
swap things.
This reminds me of decades-old research in swapping-based languages, e.g.,
where swapping instead of copying was the normal operation.
See, for example,
<a href="http://web.cse.ohio-state.edu/~weide.1/rsrg/documents/1991/91HW.pdf"
>
"Copying and Swapping: Influences on the Design of Reusable Software
Components" by Douglas E. Harms and Bruce W. Weide,
IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering, Vol 17, No. 5, May 1991</a>..
It turns out that just swapping is too limited, but this early work showed
that a <i>lot</i> can be done with just swapping, and now swapping seems
to have become an often-forgotten part of the toolbox.

I'd be interested in a discussion of using distributed VCSs with
classified data.
Obviously git, mercurial, etc. are getting more wide use.;
Google's gerrit can filter processes and work with git
(in fact, they re-implement a lot of git in Java), and
gitosis can provide finer control over who can change a git repository.
There's many hosting organizations such as
github, gitorious, SourceForge (recently added git support), etc.
I'd like to see full solutions for distributed bug tracking
(there's a lot of research).
I remember that Google had a tool that let you filter out some code
before release to the public, yet merge it back when you took patches;
I don't remember its name.

"Interactive math tutorials, often called mathlets, are designed to provide a more visceral learning experience than traditional textbook methods and to enhance intuitive understanding of complex ideas by allowing users to alter parameters that influence visual scenes. We describe methods for creating such tutorials using the HTML5 canvas element. First, we discuss some motivations for writing such mathlets, then walk-through the process of creating a mathlet with canvas. Then, we compare canvas to alternatives, explaining our decision to use it, and provide links to other demonstrations and resources."

If you violate the GPLv2, and then fix it up, what does it take to be
reinstated?  One solution is to just use GPLv3 instead; most GPL licenses
say you can use "or later versions", and the GPLv3 has a nice, clear
restoration clause (it's one of the things that was added in version 3).
Only a few programs are GPLv2-only, but that includes the Linux kernel,
so it still matters what GPLv2 means.

Selling vulnerabilities has been going on for a long time, but these
perverse incentives are only getting worse over time.
Perhaps we should criminalize selling vulnerabilities to anyone other
the software supplier (supplier bounties are okay) or governments.
People could still give them away (e.g., by posting them to the public),
but this would at least reduce the financial incentives and raise the
risks to people who find vulnerabilities and then sell them to
criminal organizations, terrorist groups, and so on.

"Linus Torvalds: Linux succeeded thanks to selfishness and trust"
by Leo Kelion, BBC</a>
has some interesting quotes from Linus Torvalds:
"I actually think the real idea of open source is for it to allow everybody to be 'selfish', not about trying to get everybody to contribute to some common good...  open source only really works if everybody is contributing for their own selfish reasons.  Now, those selfish reasons by no means need to be about 'financial reward', though...  'Trust' is not about some kind of absolute neutrality, or anything like that, but it's about a certain level of predictability and about knowing that you won't be shafted...  The fundamental property of the GPLv2 is a very simple 'tit-for-tat' model: I'll give you my improvements, if you promise to give your improvements back.  It's a fundamentally fair licence, and you don't have to worry about somebody else then coming along and taking advantage of your work.  And the thing that then seemed to surprise people, is that that notion of 'fairness' actually scales very well...
the whole 'tit-for-tat' model isn't just fair on an individual scale, it's fair on a company scale, and it's fair on a global scale."

makes it clear that while courts are often willing to accept
clickthrough agreements (clickwraps), where users have to take some
unambiguous action,
they are generally unwilling to accept
browsewraps (aka "not a contract"), since there's no evidence the
user actually agreed to anything.
That's especially true if the so-called terms have an
"we can change the terms at any time" clause - that just makes it even more
obvious that there is no evidence of user agreement.
Goldman says that,
"Avoiding this outcome is surprisingly easy.  Use clickthrough agreements,
not browsewraps, and remove any clauses that say you can unilaterally
amend the contract."

This was described by
E.W. Dijkstra in "The structure of the THE multiprogramming system",

is a mistake; Peter Neumann did PSOS, not THE.

<a href="http://opensource.com/life/13/1/software-wars?sc_cid=701600000006aAJAAY">trailer for the "Software Wars" movie about open source software</a>.
A nice quotable quote is from Linus Torvalds:
"If you can control the software, it's like controlling the flow of oil."
That makes it clear that the arguments about software are about
who has power - and who does not - instead of just some
esoteric technical discussion.

<a href="http://www.psmag.com/magazines/pacific-standard-cover-story/joe-henrich-weird-ultimatum-game-shaking-up-psychology-economics-53135/">We Aren't the World</a>
points out a real insight into problems in social science.
Historically, many social science experiments have been done on
Americans, under the assumption that people are the same everywhere.
This turns out to be completely false;
"social scientists could not possibly have picked a worse population from which to draw broad generalizations. Researchers had been doing the equivalent of studying penguins while believing that they were learning insights applicable to all birds."
<a href="http://www2.psych.ubc.ca/~henrich/pdfs/Weird_People_BBS_final02.pdf">
The Weirdest People in the World?</a> goes into detail, where by
"weird" they meant both unusual and
Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich, and Democratic.
"It is not just our Western habits and cultural preferences that are
different from the rest of the world, it appears. The very way we think
about ourselves and others - and even the way we perceive reality - makes
us distinct from other humans on the planet, not to mention from the
vast majority of our ancestors. Among Westerners, the data showed
that Americans were often the most unusual, leading the researchers to
conclude that 'American participants are exceptional even within the
unusual population of Westerners—outliers among outliers.' "

Adobe Source Code Leak is Bad News for U.S. Government
by Rachael King, Wall Street Journal, October 8, 2013, 6:28 PM ET</a>,
reports that Adobe Systems source code leaked.
"one fear is that attackers could exploit the code for ColdFusion, a Web application development platform, to find ways to directly access databases linked to public-facing websites."
But Adobe’s security chief is doubtful, for reasons that also
apply to open source software: “From my experience as someone who’s
been in possession of the source code for five years, I don’t know that
it helps the bad guys very much,” Brad Arkin, chief security officer
at Adobe told CIO Journal. “In my experience, the most efficient way
of finding vulnerabilities is not spending time with the source code
but directly testing the product while it is running,” he said.
Having source code is valuable for <i>fixing</i> vulnerabilities,
or for broadly finding vulnerabilities, but attackers generally
only need to find one vulnerability.

<a href="http://metamath.org">Metamath</a> is a cool formalized math project.
What is amazing is that it is an incredibly tiny core
(it supports only one real rule, substitution).
You can then define axioms (e.g., set theory and logic) - or use those that
come with it - and then prove lots of other things.
A lot has been proven with it;
<a href="http://wiki.planetmath.org/cgi-bin/wiki.pl/metamath_100">here
is a list of the "100 theorems" that have been proved with Metamath</a>.
I have contributed a few small proofs, including
<a href="http://us.metamath.org/mpegif/tanneg.html">tanneg</a>,
<a href="http://us.metamath.org/mpegif/tancl.html">tancal</a>, and
<a href="http://us.metamath.org/mpegif/reccot.html">reccot</a>,
and I have also posted a
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rst2hZpWUbU">video introduction
to Metamath and mmj2</a>.
Most work involves proofs using
the typical axioms used today by most mathematicians
<a href="http://us.metamath.org/mpegif/mmset.html">Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory plus the axiom of choice, aka the ZFC axioms</a>.
However, metamath is not limited to this;
<a href="http://us.metamath.org/nfegif/mmnf.html">New Foundations (NF)</a>
has also been developed.
NF is a descendent of
Russell and Whitehead's Principia Mathematica used a hierarchical
typing system
that was eventually refined into typed set theory (TST).
TST's hierarchy of types was created to avoid paradoxes
(ZFC takes a approach; it instead restricts the "size" of a set).
Quine noticed that these hierarchies could be "collaped"
to create a simpler one-sorted set theory, and first proposed it in 1937.
A remarkable result - proved in metamath - is that the axiom of choice
(an axiom in ZFC!) is <i>false</i> in New Foundations.
For more,
<a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/metamath/yj1j4Ebb1bI">see this forum discussion</a>.
You can get a sneak peek at coming metamath improvements
(including changes to set.mm) by looking at the
<a href="http://us2.metamath.org:88/">Metamath pre-production site</a>,
including the
<a href="http://us2.metamath.org:88/metamath/set.mm">pre-production
set.mm file</a>
noted in its <a href="http://us2.metamath.org:88/mpegif/mmrecent.html">most
recent proofs page</a>.
<!--
On gcc 4.9.2, I tested speed of:
time ./metamath 'read set.mm' 'prove expcnv' 'delete all' 'improve all /depth 4' 'quit /force' 'quit'

Normal times: 12.759	12.512	12.326	12.767
  Average time (seconds) = 12.591
Using :-fno-common: 12.324	12.377	12.433	12.371
  Average time (seconds) = 12.37625	
  Speedup: 1.7%
There's a speedup, but it's not worth working for it.

<a href="http://opensource.com/life/14/11/talk-kyle-simpson-javascript-expert"> Kyle Simpson has a book series on Javascript</a> that counters
common misconceptions.
<p>
There are many extensions/variations of Javascript; a common one is
<a href="http://www.typescriptlang.org/">TypeScript</a>,
a typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript
implemented as open source software (Apache 2 license).
Typescript adds support for classes (using traditional syntax),
optional static typing, declaration files, and so on.

<p>
The battle continues regarding static typing
(declaring in code the types of data).
<a href="https://danluu.com/empirical-pl/">Static vs. dynamic languages: a literature review</a> reviews some studies, which
on first blush are contradictory.
Frankly, I find the studies which report 
"no effect" much less convincing;
the better-run experiments do tend to find effects.
A more recent paper,
<a href="http://ttendency.cs.ucl.ac.uk/projects/type_study/documents/type_study.pdf">To Type or Not to Type: Quantifying Detectable Bugs in JavaScript</a>
finds that about 15% of defects were found by static typing.
Static typing can be a valuable aid for defect detection, but the importance
of that aid depends on the importance of defects.
Not all systems are that vital, after all, and static typing does
impose additional effort.
Once again, there's a trade-off in an engineering discipline;
that should surprise no one.

You can set up your own
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forge_%28software%29">forge</a>
(software project development hosting system);
you need to support at least version control (at least git), issue tracker
(for bugs and wishes), discussion (e.g., mailing list), a website
(often a wiki), and a way to download final results.
Allura is what SourceForge now uses (they switched years ago).
For simple git repository management,
<a href="http://serverfault.com/questions/225495/ubuntu-server-gitosis-user-naming-convention">gitosis has been deprecated</a>; many

Gitlab is very featureful; it used to use gitolite, but now does
its own thing.
Gitorious is also in significant use.

A common case is when you have a master repo (managed by someone else), a “forked” copy of that on GitHub, and a copy on your local machine.  Git handles this easily, you just need to set up a “remote” (a one-time action).  More in

The
Management Engine (or Manageability Engine) is a
dedicated microcontroller on all recent Intel platforms.
At one time it was on the network card; it then moved into the chipset.
It is <i>completely independent</i> from the main CPU;
it can be active even when the system is hibernating or turned off,
and it has a dedicated connection to the network interface
(e.g., it can intercept or send any data without the main CPU's knowledge).

it's a set of interfaces that have poorly-secured implementations
and runs outside the OS (and thus can subvert everything the OS does).

In Firefox you can view or remove the certificate authorities that you
trust.
Just select
Options -> Advanced -> Certificates -> View Certificates -> Authorities -> Delete or Distrust.
By default Firefox has around 100 organizations (as it groups them), with
around 200 certificates totally trusted; other web browsers are similar.
That is a large number of totally-trusted organizations, and perhaps you
do not trust them all.

"How do I submit a git patch using runbox email?"

First edit your git configuration (e.g., ~/.gitconfig.
Here's an example for username joe.example@runbox.com:

[user]
name = "Joe Example"
email = "joe.example@runbox.com"
[imap]
folder = "Inbox.Drafts"
host = imaps://secure.runbox.com
user = joe.example
sslverify = true


Then, when you want to send a git patch using runbox email, do it using:
git format-patch --to DESTINATION --stdout master | git imap-send

where "DESTINATION" is an email address to send the patch to such as "git@vger.kernel.org";
you can replace "master" with a revision range.

Now log in to runbox using an email client and view the "Drafts" folder; your new patch(es) will be there.
Review them, and if you like them, send them.

"All complex systems have bugs. Even well-audited systems have bugs...
 bugs in the stuff you depend on are likely being discovered
by people who want to hurt you, right now...
the software your attacker wrote is interested in pwning everything,
regardless of who owns it.
The only defense is to have those bugs discovered by people who want to
help you, and who then report them to manufacturers. But manufacturers
often view bugs that aren't publicly understood as unimportant, because
it costs something to patch those bugs, and nothing to ignore them, even
if those bugs are exploited by bad guys, because the bad guys are going
to do everything they can to keep the exploit secret so they can milk it
for as long as possible, meaning that even if your car is crashed (or bank
account is drained) by someone exploiting a bug that the manufacturer has
been informed about, you may never know about it. <i>There is a sociopathic
economic rationality to silencing researchers who come forward with bugs.</i>"

is an especially good explanation about what it <i>means</i> to be
color-blind, in particular its most common type (red-green).
Those with red-green color blindness can see red or green, but not as well.
That is, they can see large swatches of those colors.
The problem is that
"color detection when looking at small things, deciding what color
an item is when it's so small that only the color difference signal
at the edges can make the determination, is worse for color-blind
people. Even though the colors are easy to distinguish for large
objects, it's hard when they get small...
I can see the colors just fine (more or less). But that is true
only when the object is large enough that the color analysis isn't
being done only by edge detection. Fields of color are easy, but
lines and dots are very hard."

discusses Angular, Ember, and React
(and claims that use is waning for Backbone and Knockout).
AngularJS is the most widespread, but the core development team decided
to make Angular 2 completely different than Angular 1, which is likely a
mistake (it's kind of crazy, really - does no one care about the users?).
At least they finally figured out
<a href="http://angularjs.blogspot.com/2015/08/angular-1-and-angular-2-coexistence.html">how to make Angular 1 and Angular 2 coexist</a>, which
should aid transition, but it still looks like a pretty painful transition
(even fundamental constructs are changed).
Originally Angular 2 dropped 2-way bindings (bi-directional bindings),
which was rediculous;
thankfully Angular 2 now has them again
(though with a different syntax).
<a href="http://blog.yodersolutions.com/why-i-recommend-emberjs-over-angularjs/">Here's a recommendation for Ember over AngularJS</a>;
one argument is that
"every member on Ember’s core team is actively working on one or more production apps that use Ember... [so they are]
forced to experience all the joys and pains of using the framework...
[and] will naturally look out for the good of all developers
using the framework...
Angular 2.0 is a perfect case in point for this situation. One reason
they are going forward with a complete rewrite of the framework is
because the core team members will not experience the pain of rewriting
an app to migrate from version 1.x to 2.0."

summarizes a talk by
Rob Joyce, chief of the NSA's Tailored Access Operations (TAO).
Joyce explained how attackers get in, and how to keep them out.
Fundamentally they "hunt sysadmins", in particular, they hunt for the
"credentials of network administrators and others
with high levels of network access and privileges
that can open the kingdom to intruders."
They look for
hardcoded passwords in software or passwords that are transmitted in the clear.
No vulnerability is too insignificant for the NSA to exploit, even if it's
only temporary.
Good ways to counter them are to
"limit access privileges for important systems to those who really need them; segment networks and important data to make it harder for hackers to reach your jewels; patch systems and implement application whitelisting; remove hardcoded passwords and legacy protocols that transmit passwords in the clear...
[and use an] use an 'out-of-band network tap'".
"NSA and other APT attackers don’t rely on zero-day exploits extensively...
they don’t have to...
There’s so many more vectors that are easier...
[including] known vulnerabilities for which a patch
is available but the owner hasn’t installed it."

"No matter what promises are made on the campaign trail, terrorism will
never be vanquished. There is no ideology, no surveillance, no wall
that will definitely stop some 24-year-old from becoming radicalized
on the Web, gaining access to guns and shooting a soft target. When we
don’t admit this to ourselves, we often swing between the extremes of
putting our heads in the sand or losing them entirely...  Accepting these
vulnerabilities means our safety can be measured and evaluated on three
core premises: how well we minimize our risks, maximize our defenses
and maintain our spirit...  We lock doors, wear helmets and keep a fire
extinguisher in the kitchen — but we don’t shy from cooking on the
stove... We must demand much from our government to make us safer. But
we must also accept that vulnerability isn’t always failure." -

Here are some great quotes about manufacturing jobs, and the various
nostalgic claims about "bringing them back":
"Manufacturing retains its powerful hold on the American imagination
for good reason.
In the years after World War II, factory work created
a broadly shared prosperity that helped make the American middle class.
People without college degrees could buy a home, raise a family,
buy a station wagon, take some nice vacations...
From an economic perspective, however, there can be no revival of
American manufacturing, because there has been no collapse.
Because of automation, there are far fewer jobs in factories.
But the value of
stuff made in America reached a record high in the first quarter of 2016,
even after adjusting for inflation.
The present moment, in other words,
is the most productive in the nation’s history.
Politicians of all persuasions have tried to turn back time through a
wide range of programs best summarized as
“throwing money at factory owners.” ...
By and large, those strategies haven’t helped...
This myopic focus on factory jobs distracts from another, simpler way
to help working Americans:
Improve the conditions of the work they actually do...
The manufacturing boom of the postwar years was an oddity, and there
will be no repeat of the concatenation that made it happen: The backlog
of innovations stored up during the Great Depression and World War II;
the devastation of other industrial powers, Germany in particular,
which gave the United States a competitive edge..."

<a href="http://dancerscode.com/blog/why-the-open-code-of-conduct-isnt-for-me/">
Why the Open Code of Conduct Isn’t for Me (Sean M)</a>:
"While I agree with most of the Open Code of Conduct (as well as its
underlying intent) - these passages struck me as being problematic.
They, like all forms of political correctness, center around people being
offended, sometimes about things like technical ability which can and
should be spoken about frankly in any open source project.
Here is the problem with using offensiveness as a standard in a code
of conduct: It judges the speaker by the listener’s opinions [and]
opinions are subjective and cannot be known by the speaker until after
they speak.
Judging and punishing the behavior of those who speak based on the
sensibilities of those who listen is a standard which is inherently
unfair to the speaker.
This precipitates an environment where the exchange of ideas between
people who differ is impossible if either of them thinks that the other
may find the topic offensive. This carries with it the danger of stifling
communication and learning between people who would otherwise benefit
from a conversation that might just ruffle some feathers.
...
I think that the difference between intent to offend and being offended is an important distinction...
I hope that Github will reconsider their decision to use subjective
metrics like this as a part of their code of conduct. I hope that
they will let the people who may say things I disagree with continue
to speak their minds honestly. And when they do, I hope Github judges
their actions based on their own mindset and not mine."

an essay on Tony Hoare's statement,
"We should forget about small efficiencies, say about 97% of the time:
premature optimization is the root of all evil." and I agree with
this. Its usually not worth spending a lot of time micro-optimizing code
before its obvious where the performance bottlenecks are. But, conversely,
when designing software at a system level, performance issues should
always be considered from the beginning. A good software developer will
do this automatically, having developed a feel for where performance
issues will cause problems. An inexperienced developer will not bother,
misguidedly believing that a bit of fine tuning at a later stage will
fix any problems."

Tomorrow's politicians, civil servants, police officers, teachers,
journalists and CEOs are being created today. These people don't know
how to use computers, yet they are going to be creating laws regarding
computers, enforcing laws regarding computers, educating the youth
about computers, reporting in the media about computers and lobbying
politicians about computers. Do you [think] this is an acceptable state
of affairs? I have David Cameron telling me that internet filtering is a
good thing. I have William Hague telling me that I have nothing to fear
from GCHQ. I have one question for these policy makers:
<i>Without reference to Wikipedia, can you tell me what the difference
is between The Internet, The World Wide Web, a web-browser and a search
engine?</i>
If you can't, then you have no right to be making decisions that affect
my use of these technologies. Try it out. Do your friends know the
difference? Do you?

"Technology is an amplifier. It magnifies our best traits, and it

What it doesn’t do is make us better people.
That’s a job we can’t offload on machines."

<!--
Nicholas Carr's book The Shallows: What the Internet Is Doing to Our Brains was a finalist for the 2011 Pulitzer Prize. Now an anonymous Slashdot reader reports on Carr's newest warning:
It seems obvious: The more we learn about other people, the more we'll come to like them. The assumption underpins our deep-seated belief that communication networks, from the telephone system to Facebook, will help create social harmony. But what if the opposite is true? In a Boston Globe article, Nicholas Carr presents evidence showing that as we get more information about other people, we tend to like them less, not more. Through a phenomenon called "dissimilarity cascades," we place greater stress on personal and cultural differences than on similarities, and the bias strengthens as information accumulates. "Proximity makes differences stand out," he writes. The phenomenon intensifies online, where people are rewarded for sharing endless information about themselves. What the research indicates, warns Carr, is that the spread of social media is more likely to create social strife than social harmony.

The article concludes by opposing the idea that "If we get the engineering right, our better angels will triumph. It's a pleasant thought, but it's a fantasy... Technology is an amplifier. It magnifies our best traits, and it magnifies our worst. What it doesn't do is make us better people. That's a job we can't offload on machines."

"a deep learning model is 'just' a chain of simple, continuous geometric transformations mapping one vector space into another...
deep learning models do not have any understanding of their input, at least not in any human sense... They were trained on a different, far narrower task than the one we wanted to teach them: that of merely mapping training inputs to training targets, point by point. Show them anything that deviates from their training data, and they will break in the most absurd ways."
<li><a href="https://ml.berkeley.edu/blog/2017/07/13/tutorial-4/">
"Machine Learning Crash Course: Part 4 - The Bias-Variance Dilemma"
By Daniel Geng and Shannon Shih</a>:
"machine learning algorithms ... often run the risk of over-extrapolating
or over-interpolating from the data that they are trained on...
the best complexity lies where the test error reaches a minimum, that is, somewhere in between a very simple and a very complex model...
overfitting and underfitting have very clear signatures in training
and test data. Overfitting results in low training error and high test
error, while underfitting results in high errors in both the training
and test set.
...
we can use a technique called cross-validation [to detect these problems]..."

Q.  What's so great about ISO standardization?<br>
A.  It is often said that one of the advantages of SGML over some
    other, proprietary, generic markup scheme is that "nobody owns
    the standard".  While this is not strictly true, the ISO's pricing
    policy certainly has helped to keep the number of people who do own
    a copy of the Standard at an absolute minimum.
    [ Ed. note: I'm not exactly sure why this is seen as an advantage,
      it's just something people say. ]

Spreadsheets do calculations, but don't make it easy to see how you
got there or explain things.

calculations occurred, and the result.

it supports worksheets that are easy to exchange, you can use it remotely,

<a href="http://worrydream.com/Engelbart/">"A few words on Doug Engelbart" by Bret Victor, July 3, 2013</a>:
"The problem with saying that Engelbart "invented hypertext", or "invented
video conferencing", is that you are attempting to make sense of the
past using references to the present...
Engelbart's vision, from the beginning, was collaborative. His vision
was people working together in a shared intellectual space."
In short, his work was intended to augment human intellect, not just
create the technologies such as the mouse.
It's certainly true that his

demos (1968)</a>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mother_of_All_Demos">(Wikipedia)</a>
was a landmark event in computing.
That said, one reason today's systems don't work the same way is because
of security concerns, and all ideas are transformed as they
enter into practice.
Engelbart was an amazing innovator, and humanity has
been greatly enriched because of his work.

Event-stream is a toolkit that helps developers create and work with streams in Node.js more easily. It is used by almost 1,600 Node packages and gets downloaded around 1.8 million times per week from the npm registry.  Flatmap-stream was added as a dependency to event-stream back in September; not by the original maintainer, but by a user who received publishing rights to the package. It seems that this user, using the handle right9ctrl (now suspended on GitHub and npm), managed to convince the original author, Dominic Tarr, to transfer the package to him after making a few legitimate code contributions."

<!-- Wiener’s wife. Margaret Wiener was, by all accounts, a controlling, conservative prude—and she despised McCulloch’s influence on her husband. McCulloch hosted wild get-togethers at his family farm in Old Lyme, Connecticut, where ideas roamed free and everyone went skinny-dipping. It had been one thing when McCulloch was in Chicago, but now he was coming to Cambridge and Margaret wouldn’t have it. And so she invented a story. She sat Wiener down and informed him that when their daughter, Barbara, had stayed at McCulloch’s house in Chicago, several of “his boys” had seduced her. Wiener immediately sent an angry telegram to Wiesner: “Please inform [Pitts and Lettvin] that all connection between me and your projects is permanently abolished. They are your problem. Wiener.” He never spoke to Pitts again. And he never told him why.3
For Pitts, this marked the beginning of the end. Wiener, who had taken on a fatherly role in his life, now abandoned him inexplicably. -->

point you’re making. If your point is “No model can always be best”,
I would suggest citing Shalev-Shwartz and Ben-David. If your point is
“Learning is impossible without proper assumptions”, you might cite
the whole chapter by Shalev-Shwartz and Ben-David."

<a href="https://www.av8n.com/physics/clifford-intro.htm">Introduction
to Clifford Algebra</a> by John Denker describes Clifford Algebra,
a mathematical approach to modeling constructs (like physical space)
that seems to have a lot of advantages.
In particular, its "wedge product", unlike the traditional "cross product",
does not require any concept of handedness (e.g., right hand rule).
As a result, the 4 equations of Maxwell's equation become a single equation!

the Gigatron is cool, a computer built out of TTL logic and <i>no</i>

If you want to get a deeper understanding of how computers really work,
this isn't a bad way to do it.

It looks really amazing as-is.
It'd be cool if they added support for source code
abstract syntax trees!

Strongly recommended:
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtIzMaLkCaM">"Leadership Lab: The Craft of writing Effectively" presentation by  (Larrry McEnerney, Director of the University of Chicago's Writing Program aka Little Red Schoolhouse)</a>.
This is a good video about writing when you’re trying to create and
explain new ideas.
In particular, “your writing needs to be valuable for your audience” and
"you're here to create valuable work, not original work".
Another point: "Writing is not about communicating your ideas to your readers,
it's about changing their ideas."
He sometimes apologizes for focusing on the audience, but in my mind,
focusing on anything other than the audiences' needs is a form of selfishness.

>"Hello! You've Been Referred Here Because You're Wrong About Section 230 Of The Communications Decency Act" by Mike Masnick (June 23, 2020)</a>
is a wonderful explanatory piece about
Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act.
He recommends (and I agree) reading the actual law,
<a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/47/230"
>47 U.S. Code § 230 - Protection for private blocking and screening of offensive material</a>.

<a href="https://www.darkreading.com/vulnerabilities---threats/most-organizations-have-incomplete-vulnerability-information/d/d-id/1336460"
>"Most Organizations Have Incomplete Vulnerability Information"
by Jai Vijayan (2019-11-25)</a> says that
"Companies that rely solely on CVE/NVD are missing 33% of disclosed
flaws, Risk Based Security says."
I don't know the exact value of the number (it's probably higher than that),
but this shows that there's clearly work to do to make it easier to
submit reports to the CVE process, and I think the CVE process needs to
be more proactive so that it identifies the known vulnerabilities.
