<p>
Steelman is the original requirements document for the Ada 83 computer
programming language.
Steelman was released June 1978 by the
High Order Language Working Group (HOLWG) of the US Department of Defense (DoD).
Its formal title is
"Steelman Requirements for High Order Programming Languages",
AD-A059 444, US Dept of Defense, June 1978;
it was also published in the December 1978 edition of SIGPLAN Notices.
See the <a href="#history">history section below</a> for more about
the related history of Steelman.

Advanced users can jump to any specific requirement
by appending a "#" and the requirement number to the Steelman URL.
For example, a link to <a href="steelman.htm#3-2C">steelman.htm#3-2C</a>
brings up requirement 3-2C (which requires a Boolean type).
You can start at specific chapters in the same way, for example,
a link to
<a href="steelman.htm#9">steelman.htm#9</a> shows chapter 9
(which discusses parallel processing).
A <a href="req-list.txt">text file listing all requirement numbers and
short names</a> is also available.

<h2>Ada, C, C++, and Java vs. The Steelman</h2>
<p>
<p>
The comparison paper "Ada, C, C++, and Java vs. The Steelman" by
David A. Wheeler is also available.
This paper compares each of these languages to each of the Steelman
requirements.
You can view the <a href="steeltab.htm">normal (long) version</a>,
or a <a href="steeltas.htm">shorter version</a>
with hyperlinks to the Steelman requirement text.
This paper was published in the July/August 1997 issue of <i>Ada Letters</i>.
You may also retrieve the <a href="steeltab.ps">postscript version</a>.
<p>
Note that this document also has a number of internal hypertext link
destinations; advanced users can use these links to jump
to specific areas of the text.
For example, a link to <a href="steeltab.htm#3-2C">steeltab.htm#3-2C</a>
shows comments on how each of these languages implement Steelman requirement
3-2C (for a Boolean type).
You can also jump straight to the conclusions by jumping to
<a href="steeltab.htm#conclusions">steeltab.htm#conclusions</a>.
<p>
Note that things have changed since the publication of this paper.
In particular, Java has added several important capabilities, including
enumerations and generics.
C++ implementations have matured, though there are still an amazing
number of problems in compilers' implementation of C++ templates.

<p>
<h2 id="changes">Changes</h2>
<p>
Of course, things have changed since the papers above.
There was an
<a href="http://www.adaic.org/ada-resources/standards/ada05/">Ada 2005</a>,
and then an
<a href="http://www.ada2012.org/">Ada 2012</a>,
and both have extended Ada further.
<p>
In Ada 2005 and 2012 the assertion-related Steelman requirements
<a href="steelman.htm#10B">10B</a>
is better met, and
Steelman requirement
<a href="steelman.htm#10F">10F</a>
changes Ada from "no" to "yes".
Ada 2005 added a simple built-in assertion, which was enough to
meet those requirements.
Ada 2012 later added
built-in support for preconditions, postconditions,
invariants, and quantified expressions, which are far more powerful
built-ins for program assertions.

TODO: Need to review this issue.
<p>
Steelman requirement <a href="steelman.htm#10B">10B</a>
(Nonassignable Record Components)
may be better met today.

<p>
<a href="http://www.dwheeler.com/essays/ada-keynote.pdf">In 2003 I gave
a keynote at the SIGAda conference</a>, noting things that needed to change
in Ada.
It took a while,
<a href="http://www.ada2012.org/">Ada 2012</a> incorporated several of
the issues I noted, including the need for a bigger standard libraries,
some syntactic sugar to simplify some common constructs,
and changes to simplify interaction with other systems.
When I presented in 2003 I noted that
"C functions often can't map to Ada functions", and I recommended
that Ada allow functions to have "in out" parameters.
This was considered heresy at the time, even though the Ada prohibition
didn't actually achieve anything other than making interfaces hard
to create (Ada functions could always manipulate global values).
Ada 2012 now allows functions to have "in out" parameters, just as I
had recommended at the time.

<p>
Of course, other languages have changed too.
Java, for example, now has generics.

<h2 id="history">History of Steelman</h2>
<p>
In the 1970s the US Department of Defense (DoD) noted that its
costs for computing were skyrocketing.
A summary of the costs of the time can be found in
"Automatic Data Processing Costs in the Defense Department" by
David A. Fisher, October 1974, Institute for Defense Analyses (IDA)
Paper P-1046.
Steelman development later began; here's how the process
is explained in IDA document P-1191 from 1976:
<blockquote>
"In January 1975, the Director, Defense Research and Engineering (DDR&amp;E),
in a memo to the Assistant Secretaries of the
Military Departments for R&amp;D, noted the multiple benefits of a
single common language for military applications.
He requested immediate formulation of a joint Service program to
assure maximum useful software commonality in the DoD.
A working group was formed from official representatives of the Military
Departments and chaired by DDR&amp;E.
Representatives from OASD-I&amp;L,
OASD-Comptroller, and the Defense Communications Agency, and NASA
also participated. The author [David Fischer]
acted as technical advisor...
This trial set of characteristics was widely distributed
by the Military Departments with a request that the recipients
submit their own set of language requirements in response.
Outside contractors, contacted by the individual offices that deal
with them, responded overwhelmingly. The responses were first
sent to Working Group representatives
of the individual Departments for coordination
within their departments and on to IDA.
IDAâ€™s task was to analyze, interpret, and resolve the responses into
a consistent and unambiguous set of needed characteristics.
In many cases, this involved direct consultation
with individual contributors. The result was an extensive document
which explained some of the implications, noted the trade-offs
which were considered, and, in general, provided the ra
tionale behind the listed characteristics.
The whole process was then repeated.
The revised document
was distributed by the Services and, again, many thoughtful and
helpful responses were received, processed, analysed, and
reconciled by IDA. A revised version of the characteristics was then
prepared. This set of requirements involved few major changes..."

The previous versions of Steelman were named:
<ol>
<li>Strawman: HOLWG, DoD, April 1975. This was the original draft.
<a href="http://iment.com/maida/computer/requirements/strawman.htm">Strawman
(for Ada) is available online</a>.
<a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/m/#!msg/comp.lang.ada/UaO0ZN4Q4tQ/a9JD2Is4FY0J">Arthur Evans Jr reports that there was a draft requirements
document earlier than the "Strawman" document of mid-1975</a>
but it got no responses.
He said about Strawman:
"Anyone even moderately competent at language design recognized that the
requirements were self-contradictory and, given the then state of the
art, vastly over ambitious; I said so.  Later, I learned that Strawman
had been deliberately written that way in order to elicit responses from
people (like me) who were perfectly happy to point out how DoD didn't
understand the problem, but who probably wouldn't otherwise have
bothered replying.  (Clever!  I think Dave Fisher gets credit for that
idea)."
<li>Woodenman: HOLWG, DoD, 1975

High Order Programming Language", David A. Fisher,

<li>Tinman: HOLWG, DoD, Jan 1976

Department of Defense - Background and Technical Requirements",
Institute for Defense Analyses, Paper P-1191, AD-A028297, IDA Log Number
HQ 76-18215, June 1976.
Fisher's paper has not just the requirements but a great deal of
background material and rationale, so Fisher's paper is 158 pages long.
After Tinman came out, there was a conference at Cornell at which
position papers were presented on it, published in:
"Design and Implementation of Programming Languages",
DoD Sponsored Workshop, Ithaca 1976, Lecture Notes in Computer Science #54,
Springer-Verlag.
<a href="http://iment.com/maida/computer/requirements/tinman.htm">Tinman
(for Ada) is available online</a>.
<li>Ironman: Ironman was issued in January 1977.
Its requirements were substantially the same as Tinman but with a
different format.
An official reference for this document is:
High Order Language Working Group, "Department of Defense Requirements
for High Order Computer Programming Languages - IRONMAN", January 14, 1977.

Fisher did some work regarding numeric
computation, and an appendix to that report includes the basic
requirements of revised ironman.  So a reference which you can actually

Steelman was the final requirements document for the language design,
which then went to an international competition.
There were four entrants, which were called
Green (from Honeywell and Jean Ichbiah),
Red (from Intermetrics),
Blue (from Softech), and Yellow (from Wirth and Pascal crew).
Green won, and was renamed as Ada.
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/aeronautics-and-astronautics/16-01-unified-engineering-i-ii-iii-iv-fall-2005-spring-2006/comps-programming/15_robertdewar.pdf">"Ada: Past, Present, and Future" by Robert Dewar has some comments about this competition.</a>
<p>
<a href="http://iment.com/maida/computer/redref/">Early Ada documents
including copies of Strawman, Woodenman, Tinman, Ironman, Steelman,
and versions of the "Red" language are available
from Mary S. Van Deusen</a>.

<p>
Ada did not fare as well as it could have, primarily because it cost
<i>far</i> too much to get and use an Ada compiler.
They were often orders of magnitude more expensive to buy, and typical
PCs couldn't run them (you needed nonstandard memory cards just to load one).
There were reasons for this.
A strategic decision made in the early version of the Ada language,
which I believe was a terrible mistake, was its rule that there would be
no subsets and no supersets.
Allowing arbitrary subsetting and supersetting would have been a problem,
but having <i>no</i> subsets or supersets was an overly-strict rule.
I think if there had been at least a standard subset without tasking,
and perhaps a few other capabilities, early Ada would have fared much
better.
You can create standards with standardized subsets and supersets
(I did that with OpenDocument OpenFormula), and that would have
made Ada far more practical for the computers at the time.
A subtle related problem was that people thought that because Ada was
ambitious, it <i>had</i> to be hard to implement - a self-fulfilling
prophecy.
Too many of its early implementers didn't focus on making the implementations
easy.
The result was that while early Ada compilers were capable, they were
also slow, big, and very expensive... and that severely hampered where
Ada could be used in practice.
<i>Cost matters</i> - failing to ensure that Ada compilers were affordable
turned out to be a disastrous mistake.
<p>
After the language was standardized as Ada 83 its history becomes
much easier to track.
The
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ada_%28programming_language%29">Wikipedia
article on the Ada programming language</a> has much about its evolution.
One part of Ada's history that perhaps was not so clear was that
after its original release,
<a href="../essays/make-it-simple-dewar.html">Robert Dewar determined
how to implement key Ada requirements in a more conventional way</a>,
resulting in a far smaller, far faster, and far less expensive Ada compiler.
Indeed, Ada has been part of the GCC compiler since the 1990s, making
Ada far more available.
