10. Bd3  h6
11. Bh4  b4!?  {the idea is to cramp Wt's pieces, but this gives Wt a target}
12. Rb1?
 {Black says: "I've no idea of what the idea here was!?  --to lose?",
  but White has a reason for this move.  White has noticed that
  Black's clock has nearly expired and all White
  has to do is make moves fast without losing but attacking enough
  that  Black will have to think about his moves.
  By moving Rb1, the next bxc will suddenly give White's rook
  an open file with a potential move to the 7th rank.  White
  figures that's threatening enough to keep time pressure on Black.
}
12. ...  b4xc3  {Black takes the offered piece}
13. bxc3  Qa5
 {Black figures that this is -/+ and that Black has a won game, since
  White has nothing for the lost N.  White figures that Black's clock is
  about to expire (it started at 5 min each) and
  avoiding mate is all that's needed to win.}
14. c4  ...
*
{From this point on, the game was woodpushing, and as White expected
 Black's clock expired first. Bk took a2's enticing risk,
 ultimately to find the Q trapped, but Wt didn't go for it (after Re2-c3);
 Bk later gave the Q away before noticing a B's protection of back-row mate
 on d1.
 Later moves not recorded, unfortunately.
