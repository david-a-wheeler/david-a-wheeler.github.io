  {attacking a potential pawn base. If White plays b5, that
   permits Black to play Nc5 with a nice central, protected
   Knight that attacks White's e4 pawn.
   If White plays c5, Black can undermine c5 pawn, though that
     might have worked out.
   If White plays bxa5, Rxa5 and now White has 3 pawn islands
   to Black's two. }
