{Just a simple little game against ChessGenius on a Palm PDA,
but fun.  The sides castle to opposite ends and storm each other's
positions, with queen attacks on both sides.
ChessGenius was at "Easy 02" level, not at its best. So sue me.}

{This begins black's attack on white's king, which makes the
white king walk across the board. Black's attack eventually peters out.}
