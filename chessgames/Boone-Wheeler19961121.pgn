1. e4 e5 
2. Nf3 Nc6 
3. Bb5 a6 
4. Ba4 Nf6 
5. O-O Bd6??
{ ?? - This blocks the d pawn.  }
6. d4 O-O 
7. Re1 Re8 
8. d5 Na5 
9. Bg5 b5 
10. Bb3 Nxb3 
11. axb3 c6 
12. c4 Qb6??
{ This abandons the Knight and helps white's king-side attack
  by requiring that exchange be performed by the Kingside pawn, ruining
  Black's position. }
13. Bxf6 gxf6 
14. dxc6 Bc5 
15. Kh1 dxc6 
16. cxb5 cxb5 
17. Nc3 Bxf2 
18. Nd5 Qc6
19. Rf1
{ Preparing for Nxf6.  }
19... Bd4?!
{ ?! - This move was hasty-black is now under time pressure.  }
20. Nxd4 exd4 
21. Qxd4 Qc2
{ Black hopes to counterattack with a Queen/Bishop combination,
  and to unite Rooks, by moving the Bishop.
  But White's mating attack has already begun.  }
22. Nxf6+ Kf8 
23. Qd6+ Re7 
24. Qd8+ Kg7 
25. Qg8+ Kh6 
26. Qxh7+ Kg5 
27. Rf5+??
{ White thinks this is mate, but it really just loses an exchange.
  Better is Qh5, which really is mate.  It worked out this time,
  but had it been the Queen ...  }
27... Bxf5 
28. Qxf5+ Kh4
{ Kh6 *might* save the King, but will probably drop the Rook, at least..  }
29. Qh5#
1-0
