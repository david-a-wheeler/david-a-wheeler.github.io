8. dxe5 Nb7    {Black retreats again; end of book opening we'd agreed to}
9. Nc3 O-O
10. Ne4 d5
11. Neg5 Bf5 {Black protects pawn at h7; Crafty recommends h6 instead}
12. c4 Nc5
13. Nd4? Qd7?!
{Should have played Bd3:  Nxc6 Bxe2, Nxd8 Bxf1, Nc6 Bxg5, Bxg5 f6! -+ ; or
            Qh5 h6, Nxc6 Qd7, Nxe7+ Qxe7, cd Qxd5, Be7 Rfe8, Bxc5 Qxc5-+}
14. Re1 Nd3
15. e6?       {This opens a fatal file.}
15. ... fxe6
16. Qh5??      {Whups! A fatal flaw.  Nxf5 would have been better}

23. Bb4 c5
24. Bc3 Rg5
25. Rxe6?
     {this move loses, but what else?  Qf2 or Kh1: Rxf3! ; Kf1!?.
      Crafty suggests Qe4, Re3, or Kf2. }
25. ...Rxg2+!
{Black pulls a surprise move out of his hat; if Kxg2 then Qxf3+ Kg1 Qf1#.}
26. Kh1 Qd1+?
{Better plays for Black would have been Rxf3, Rc2, or Rxh2+.
 Black pleads for White's King to take the Rook--because white 
 can win:  Re1! Qe7 (if Qxf3 Re8+! Rf8, Qxc5+! Kh8! (Qf7 leads to
 simplification), Rxf8+ Qxf8, Kxg2 +-), Kxg2 ... (so, Re1 Rxh1+!
 ... and then the simplification previously shown nets 2 P for N).
 Better is:  Re2!, Rxe2 Qxf3+, Rg2 Qd1+!, Be1 Rf1+, Rg1 Qd5+ -+.
 It's not clear if this would have been seen during play, since even
 after some analysis neither player saw this sequence.}
27. Kxg2??
 {Ouch, this leads to mate.  Re1 would have been better.}
27. ... Qxf3+
28. Kg1 Qf1#
