[Round "1"]
[White "Meyer, Brian"]
[Black "Wheeler, David A."]
[Result "0-1"]

{Brian Meyer is age 5, and playing well for his age!
However, Wheeler pulls out a checkmate in 9 moves.
The interesting thing about this game is the checkmate, which has a
dangling knight and queen.}

1. e4 e5 2. Bc4 Nf6 3. Nf3 Nc6 4. Nh4?
{Uh oh, this places the knight away from the center and
leaves the e4 pawn undefended.}

4... Nxe4 5. Bb3? {Doesn't protect knight on h4}

5... Qxh4 6. O-O Bc5
{This creates pressure on f2}

7. Qe2 O-O
8. Qc4? {This is a good idea in principle; white is setting up
a diagonal on a2-g8, with the queen in front, directly attacking
black's king.  However, the timing is bad, because this
moves a white defender away from protecting f2.}

8... Bxf2+

9. Kh1
{Defending using Rxf2 won't help - then Qxf2+ Kh1 Qe1+ Qf1 Qxf1#}

9...Ng3#
{Black mates. Note that nifty dangling knight, which can't be
attacked by the h2 pawn because it's pinned, and the Queen is
dangling too.} 0-1
