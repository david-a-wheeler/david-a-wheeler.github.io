1. e4 e6
2. Nf3 d5
3. d3 Bb4+
4. Nc3
 {This may not have been a good move, perhaps Bd2 would be better.
  With this move, black could force a queen trade where white can't castle.}
4... dxe4
5. dxe4 Nc6
 {Bad move, allows White to trade queens and forbid black to castle.}
6. Qxd8+ {White trades queens so that black won't be able to castle.}
6.... Kxd8
7. Bc4 Bxc3+
8. bxc3 Nge7
9. O-O h6
10. Bf4 a6
11. Ne5 {Threatening Nf7 to fork rook and king.}
11.... Rf8
12. Rad1+ Ke8
13. Nxc6 {By trading knights, this opens Bxc7 to pick up a black pawn.}
13.... Nxc6
14. Bxc7 e5
15. f4 exf4
16. Bxf4 Bf4
17. Rd2 b5
18. Bd5 {This pins the knight on c6, since if the knight moves, white
    can take the rook on a8.} Kd7? {Bad move, permits discovered check.}
19. Bxf7+ {A discovered check so white can pick off one of black's pawns.}
19.... Kc8
{Now the position is: r1k2r2/5Bp1/p1n4p/1p6/4PBb1/2P5/P1PR2PP/5RK1}
20. Bd5 Kd7
21. Bg3 Rxf1+
22. Kxf1 Rc8
23. Rd3 Rf8+
24. Kg1 Be2 {Threatens white's rook at d3 and a mate with Rf1. Nasty!}
25. h3
{removing the mate threat; black gets a white rook for a black bishop,
 and officially black now has more piece material,
 but at least white's pawn structure improves. White now storms his
 central pawns, threatening to promote a pawn.}
25. ... Bxd3
26. cxd3 g5
27. Bb3 a5
28. d4 h5
29. e5 a4
30. Bc2 h4
31. Bf2 Nd8
32. d5 Rf7
33. e6+ Nxe6 {Black gives up his Knight to eliminate white's two
    advanced central pawns.}
34. dxe6+ Kxe6
    {Now it's black's rook vs. white's two bishops, plus 4 pawns and king each.}
35. Bd3 Kd5
36. Bxb5 Rc7
37. c4+ Kd6
38. Be3 Rg7
39. Bxa4 Rg8
{Now: 6r1/8/3k4/6p1/B1P4p/4B2P/P5P1/6K1}

48. c7+ Kd7
49. Bg4+ Ke7
50. c8=Q Rxc8
51. Bxc8 Kd8
52. Bg4
 {It's hopeless for black now; the king cannot pass the diagonals
  defined by the bishops, and white can now promote the a-pawn without
  opposition.}
52.... Ke8
53. a4 Ke7
54. a5 Kf7
55. a6 Kf6
56. a7 Kf7

{Final position: 6k1/6Q1/8/4B3/6Bp/7P/6P1/6K1}
