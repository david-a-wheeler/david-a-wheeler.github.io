8. d4 b5
9. Bb3 Bg4 {creating a nasty pin on the Knight through to the Queen}
10. Bd5 {One pin deserves another; white creates a pin on another
    Knight through to a Rook, and theatens to take the Knight
    for free.  This isn't a good pin, but it's enough to force Black
    to protect the Knight.}
   ... Qd7 {Protecting the Knight}
11. Qd3 {getting out of the pin, but continuing to force the Queen
    to babysit the f3 Knight and put the Queen uncomfortably close
    to the center of the board early in the game.}
   ... exd4
12. cxd4 Bxf3
    {If White took the Bishop back with Qxf3, then Black wins with:
     Nxd4 threatening the Queen.  If White protects with the Queen,
     Black has chopped off a central pawn and can hold onto it.
     For example, Black could bring the Knight
     back to c3 (to protect the Rook) or capture White's
     light-square bishop with Nxd5, or just move the Rook.
     White has to do something else.}
13. Bxc6 {White counter-attacks with the Bishop and attacks
    Black's Queen.  White isn't worried about Black sacrificing
    the Bishop onto one of the King pawns, since White will get
    Black's Queen in compensation.}
    ... Qxc6
14. Qxf3 {Now that Black's c6 Knight is gone, White can safely
    take Black's Bishop with the Queen}
    ... Rfe8 {beginning to gang up on one of White's central pawns}
15. Nc3 Bf8
16. Qg3 {White is trying to set up Bh6 once Black moves his Bishop,
    but Black never fell for it}
    ... b4
17. d5 Nxd5
18. Nxd5 Qxd5!
    {Sneaky move by Black!! White can't take Black's Queen using
    exd5, because of the back-row mate threat Rd1#. }
19. Qg4 Re6
20. b3
 { The point of White's move is to give his remaining Bishop somewhere
   to go.
   At this point Black lost on time. The game continued just
   to see how it would have gone. }
   ... Qe5
21. Bd2 Rae8
22. Bxb4 Qd4
23. Ba5 Rxe4
24. Qd1 Rxe1+
25. Bxe1 Qxd1
26. Rxd1 Re2
27. a4 c5
28. Kf1 Rb2
29. Rd3 f6
30. h3
 { At this point the game halted so Davy Lo could get a game in
   with Dan Lehman. Lehman (Black) probably would have eventually
   won positionally; Black has a Queenside pawn majority. }
1-0
