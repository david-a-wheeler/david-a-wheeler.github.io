This game was reconstructed from notes by all of the participants,
but since the original notes were incomplete (and in error) this may
not have been exactly how the game went.

After a number of moves Dan Lehman left and was replaced by Reg Meeson.
 
Dan managed to really open things up on the Kingside. How?
 "By tactics learned from book that's helped me immeasurably, by Houdini,
  in the chapter on sleight-of-hand!  (-;
  (that, and I used the grade-school trick of pulling Dave's chair closer to
  the table, with my feet, and this gave him a cramped feeling)".
 
   I think that my (and JB's) departure from the book began on the 1st
   chance, with d5.  Dave consumed some time with Q moves to b6, b7, & then
   to a7 to align with B on b6 and so pressure f2/e3 strongly, which pressure
   I broke finally with Qf3 before turning over the favorable position to Reg
   for the Kside aggression.
