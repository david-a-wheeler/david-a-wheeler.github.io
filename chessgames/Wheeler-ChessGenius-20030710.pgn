{Just a simple little game against ChessGenius on a Palm PDA,
but pleasantly satisfying.
This was Wheeler's first try into the "build-a-house" opening.}


1. Nf3 d5
2. g3 Nc6
3. Bg2 e5
4. d3 Bb4+
5. Nc3 Bf5
6. O-O Nf6
7. e4 {Now that white has his King protected, and black doesn't,
 White tries to simplify the board (particularly the center)
 to attack the poorly-situated black king.}

15. Rae1 Nxd5
16. Qxd5 f6
17. Be3 {Theatening black's queen}
17. ... c6?
{Black counter-threats.  However, this is a bad idea;
an exchange of queens will allow Nc7+, forking the
king and rook; this will cause a material loss (black's Rook
for white's knight) and black will have an even harder time
protecting his king, since black won't be able to castle}
18. Bxb6 Kf8
{Unclear why this move was made instead of cxd5}
19. Qe6 cxb5
20. Bc7 b4

24. Qxe7+ Kg8
25. Qe8# {A very pleasing mate.}
