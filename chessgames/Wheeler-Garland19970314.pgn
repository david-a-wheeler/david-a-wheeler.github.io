{Black let White get ahead in development; White had castled before
 Black could even do so, and Black didn't have a very safe place to put
 his King. Black started with a spacial advantage with a row of pawns,
 but this came crashing down on 11. b3.  White then attacked d5 hoping
 to eventually capture the rook at a1, but Black repulsed the attack.
 White then exchanged pieces (a bad move, since Black's king
 was open to attack while White's was not).  Pieces were exchanged left
 and right, and eventually ended with White managing to Queen a pawn first.}

19. Qxb7?  {This exchange of Queens was a bad move by White,
  because Black is wide open while White is well-defended.
  An aggressive move sequence by White such as
  19. Bf7+ Kd8 Bg5+ Kc8 Re1 (threatening Re8)
  would have given Black a terrible position with many mating
  possibilities and/or opportunities to lose pieces.
  At that point Bd6 looks good for Black,
  but that is countered with g3 and later with Bg8.}
