</center>
<p>
This short paper gives links to important pages related to
Open Source Software / Free Software (OSS/FS), also called
Free-Libre / Open Source Software (FLOSS) or FOSS.
This idea / movement / community has risen to prominence, and I've
found it very interesting.
The following are the links I've found most helpful to understanding it.
<p>
<h1><a name="definitions">Definitions/Names</a></h1>
You can find definitions for the terms
<A HREF="http://www.opensource.org/osd.html">open source software
(OSS, defined in the Open Source Definition)</A> and
<A HREF="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html">free software
(defined by the Free Software Foundation (FSF))</A>.
In practice, nearly all software meeting one definition also meets the other.
In summary, OSS/FS programs are programs whose licenses permit
users the freedom to run the program for any purpose,
to study and modify the program, and to freely redistribute copies of the
original or modified program.
<p>
The motives (or at least the emphasis)
of the people who use the term ``open source'' are sometimes different than
those who use the term ``Free Software.''
The term ``open source software'' (a term championed by Eric Raymond)
is often used by people who wish to stress aspects such as high reliability
and flexibility of the resulting program as the primary motivation
for developing such software.
In contrast, the term ``Free Software'' (used in this way)
stresses freedom from control by another (the standard explanation is
``think free speech, not free beer'').
The FSF has a page written by its founder, Richard Stallman,
on <a href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-software-for-freedom.html">why
the FSF
prefers the term ``free software'' instead of ``open source software''</a>.
<a href="http://emoglen.law.columbia.edu/publications/lu-07.html">Eben Moglen
has some commentary about these two terms as well</a>.
<a href="http://www.infoworld.com/articles/hn/xml/02/10/01/021001hnbizopen.xml?s=IDGNS">Merrill Lynch executive Robert Lefkowitz found what may be a better
way to describe the phrase free software:
"We like to think of it as 'free as in market.'"</a>
A <a href="http://lwn.net/daily/guardians.php3">speech by Tony
Stanco</a> describes some of the issues of free software; a good quote
from it is that "[in cyberspace] software is the 
functional equivalent to law in real space, because it controls people, 
just like law does... [it is] much more obedient and 
therefore dangerous in the wrong hands."
In contrast, Eric Raymond's
Open Source Initiative declares that the term ``open source''
is <a href="http://www.opensource.org/faq.html">``a marketing program
for free software''</a> (and recommends using
the term ``open source'' instead).
<p>
<a name="linux-vs-gnu-linux">In a similar manner,
the most widely used OSS/FS operating system is
referred to by two names: ``GNU/Linux'' and simply ``Linux.''</a>
``GNU'' is pronounced ``guh-new'', and ``Linux'' rhymes with ``cynics.''
Technically, the name ``Linux'' is just the name of one system component
(the ``kernel''), but often ``Linux'' is used to mean the entire system.
Richard Stallman has written an article on
<a href="http://www.fsf.org/gnu/why-gnu-linux.html">why he believes
GNU/Linux should be the preferred term when discussing the entire
system</a>, as well as a
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/gnu/gnu-linux-faq.html">FAQ</a>.
The advantage of the term ``GNU/Linux'' is that it properly gives credit
to the organization most responsible for its development - the
FSF's GNU project.
Not only did the FSF spearhead the initial work, but
<a href="http://www.dwheeler.com/sloc">as measured by
lines of code the GNU project contributes far more code than
the Linux kernel does</a>.
An advantage of the term ``Linux'' is that it's much easier to say.
It's also worth noting that many other organizations besides GNU
helped develop GNU/Linux, and calling the result ``GNU/Linux'' doesn't
give them credit.
I try to use the term ``GNU/Linux'' here and in my related paper
<a href="http://www.dwheeler.com/oss_fs_why.html">Why Open Source Software /
Free Software? Look at the Numbers!</a>, simply to be consistent
(I have to pick <i>a</i> name!).
In person, and in some other articles, I use either one;
while names are important, I'm more interested in clear communication.
<p>
The Free Software Foundation has developed a set of
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/categories.html">terms for
categories of software</a> that you may find helpful.
<!--
<p>
Different people often have a range of motivations for working
on different projects.
Some people simply give away their software because they get changes back,
resulting in a product better than what they could have produced alone.
In a sense, they're getting the product that they want at less cost
than if they tried to develop it themselves.
Others develop simply for the pleasure of developing software.
-->
<!--  Too much detail?
At the
http://lwn.net/2001/0301/history.php3 first LinuxWorld Conference
and Expo</a>, Eric Raymond (OSI), Richard Stallman (FSF), and
Linus Torvalds (leader of the Linux kernel project) had this classic
exchange showing three different motivations:

  Eric: I want to live in a world where software doesn't suck. 
  Richard: Any software that isn't free sucks. 
  Linus: I'm interested in free beer. 

-->
<p>
The word "free" has many different meanings, and these different meanings
often make it harder to understand OSS/FS.
The term "Free software" (as used in OSS/FS literature) is based on the word
"freedom" (the word "libre" is used in some other languages).
However, "free" can also mean "no cost", and sometimes "no cost" products come
with a "catch" that in fact is the <i>opposite</i> of freedom.
<a href="http://linuxtoday.com/news_story.php3?ltsn=2002-04-20-002-26-OS&amp;tbovrmode=1#talkback_area">A LinuxToday posting</a>
found a simple way to express these different meanings of the word
free, which I'll slightly paraphrase here:
<blockquote>
Free can mean:
<ul>
<li>Free, as in free speech.
<li>Free, as in free beer.
<li>Free, as in free cocaine ("the first one is on me").
</ul>
- They are not all the same.
</blockquote>
<!--
The poster then adds  
"... do people really, REALLY price their freedom at zero?
Because MS [Microsoft] stuff is only cheap/free if
your freedom really is worth nothing."
Indeed, Microsoft in particular is famous for giving away things for free or at
lower prices, and raising prices substantially and limiting
your alternatives once you're hooked.
-->
Indeed, the notion of being "free from control by another" 
is a concept that many OSS/FS advocates or sympathizers emphasize.
For example, ZDNet's article by David Berlind titled
<a href="http://techupdate.zdnet.com/techupdate/stories/main/0,14179,2875958,00.html">Who gave Microsoft control of your IT costs? You did</a>, states that
"Let this be a lesson: The minute you get you or your company hooked
on a proprietary technology, you put the vendor of that technology
in control of a lot of things that I'm certain you'd prefer to control..."
<!--
he then goes on to state that includes giving up control over cost,
security, stability, performance, and scalability, and closes stating that
those who depend on proprietary approaches must accept the
"consequences of addiction."
-->
This is publicly known to be Microsoft's approach;
as reported by Cnet (July 2, 1998), Bill Gates said that
"about 3 million computers get sold every year in China,
but people don't pay for the software... Someday they will, though.
As long as they are going to steal it, we want them to steal ours.
They'll get sort of addicted, and then we'll somehow figure out how
to collect sometime in the next decade."

Colin Stefani noted on August 1, 2002, that the license for
Windows update "SP3" now requires that users give automatic consent
to send to Microsoft not only their product identification number, but
the names and version numbers of <i>every</i> software package, and
the id's of every hardware device.
Many people fear this kind of loss of privacy.

Bugtraq posting:
Subject: RE: Windows 2000 Service Pack 3 now available.
From: Colin Stefani <cstefani@tideworks.com>
Date: Thu, 1 Aug 2002 14:43:42 -0700
To: "'Leif Sawyer'" <lsawyer@gci.com>, bugtraq@securityfocus.com, full-disclosure@lists.netsys.com

Be sure to read the new EULA/privacy statement for Windows update, it has an
interesting portion about how Windows Update and Automatic Update (which
gets installed with SP3) can, by agreeing to this license, send the
following pieces of info to Microsoft, this was posted on the MS focus list
by Javier Sanchez:

"With the latest version of Windows Update (essentially a mandatory download
and now part of SP3) you consent to sending the following information to
Microsoft:

* Operating-system version number and Product Identification number 
* Internet Explorer version number 
* Version numbers of other software 
* Plug and Play ID numbers of hardware devices 

This is stated in the "Windows Update Privacy Statement" which you can read
at <http://v4.windowsupdate.microsoft.com/en/about.asp?> You can also
follow the "About Windows Update" link off the WindowsUpdate page. Don't
bother trying to right-click, they've made sure to disable that."

Enjoy! Way to go MS!

At one time, it was widely understood that while commercial off the shelf
(COTS) products were useful, you needed to stick with standards so
that you had the freedom to switch to competing products when necessary.
That lesson has had to be re-learned by some people quite painfully.

IanM ianm@firstlinux.net used this interesting phrasing

``In any case, do people really, REALLY price their freedom at zero?

<p>
Don't confuse ``open source software'' or ``free software''
with ``non-commercial'' software -- there are many examples
of commercial open source / free software, and OSS/FS must be
usable for commercial purposes.
Antonyms of OSS/FS are ``closed'' and ``proprietary'' software.

<h1><a name="licenses">OSS/FS Software Licenses</a></h1>
Essentially all of today's software is licensed; to be OSS/FS, the software
license has to follow certain rules.
As noted above, although there are two different definitions
(for <a href="http://www.opensource.org/osd.html">open source software</a> and
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html">free software</a>),
in practice a license either meets or doesn't meet both definitions.
<p>
The
<a href="http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/Software-Release-Practice-HOWTO/index.html">Software Release Practice HOWTO</a>
discusses briefly why license choices are so important to
OSS/FS projects: 

<blockquote><i>
The license you choose defines the social contract you wish to set up among your co-developers and users ... 
<br>
       Who counts as an author can be very complicated, especially for software that has been worked on by many hands. This is why licenses are important. By setting out the terms under
       which material can be used, they grant rights to the users that protect them from arbitrary actions by the copyright holders. 
<br>
       In proprietary software, the license terms are designed to protect the copyright. They're a way of granting a few rights to users while reserving as much legal territory is possible for
       the owner (the copyright holder). The copyright holder is very important, and the license logic so restrictive that the exact technicalities of the license terms are usually unimportant.
<br>
       In open-source software, the situation is usually the exact opposite; the copyright exists to protect the license. The only rights the copyright holder always keeps are to enforce the
       license. Otherwise, only a few rights are reserved and most choices pass to the user. In particular, the copyright holder cannot change the terms on a copy you already have.
       Therefore, in open-source software the copyright holder is almost irrelevant -- but the license terms are very important. 
</i></blockquote>
<p>
There are dozens of OSS/FS licenses, but nearly all OSS/FS
software uses one of the four major licenses:
the GNU General Public License (GPL),
the GNU Lesser (or Library) General Public License (LGPL),
the MIT (aka X11) license, and the BSD-new license.
Indeed the Open Source Initiative refers to these four licenses as the
<a href="http://www.opensource.org/licenses/">classic open source licenses.</a>
The GPL and LGPL are termed ``copylefting'' licenses, that is,
these licenses are designed to prevent the code from becoming proprietary.
See <a href="http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/opensources/book/perens.html">Perens' paper</a> for more information comparing these licenses.
The GPL allows anyone to use the program and modify it, but
prevents code from becoming proprietary once distributed and it also
forbids proprietary programs from "linking" to it.
The MIT and BSD-new licenses let anyone do almost anything with the code
except sue the authors.
One minor complication:
there are actually two "BSD" licenses, sometimes called "BSD-old" and
"BSD-new"; new programs should use BSD-new instead of BSD-old.
The LGPL is a compromise between the GPL and MIT/BSD-new approaches and
is primarily intended for code libraries;
like the GPL, LGPL-licensed software
cannot be changed and made proprietary, but
the LGPL does permit proprietary programs to link to the library.
<!--

The most popular OSS/FS license by far is the GPL.
For example, Freshmeat.net reported on April 4, 2002
that 71.85% of the 25,286 software branches (packages) it tracked
are GPL-licensed (the next two most popular were LGPL, 4.47%,
and the BSD licenses, 4.17%).
Sourceforge.net reported on April 4, 2002 that the GPL accounted
for 73% of the 23,651 ``open source'' projects it hosted
(next most popular were the LGPL, 10%, and the BSD licenses, 7%).
In my paper
<a href="http://www.dwheeler.com/sloc">More than a Gigabuck:
Estimating GNU/Linux's Size</a>,
I found that Red Hat Linux, one of the most popular GNU/Linux distributions,
had over 30 million physical source lines of code in version 7.1,
and that 50.36% of the lines of code were licensed solely
under the GPL (the next most common were the MIT license, 8.28%,
and the LGPL, 7.64%).
If you consider the lines that are dual licensed
(licensed under both the GPL and another license, allowing
users and developers to pick the license to use),
the total lines of code under the GPL accounts for 55.3% of the total. 
<a href="http://www.dwheeler.com/essays/gpl-compatible.html">My paper
on GPL compatibility discusses these figures further.</a>
<p>
The popularity of the GPL is easy to explain, indeed,
for many OSS/FS projects the GPL is a good license.
An OSS/FS program using a non-copylefting
license like the MIT or BSD-new license
can be taken by a large company, extended in incompatible ways,
and made proprietary .
Over time the proprietary version may have so many
features needed by customers (or be incompatible with the original)
that all users, including the original developers, have to buy and become
dependent on that other company for what was originally the original
developers' work.
This technique is sometimes called "embrace, extend, extinguish".
Whether or not this is a problem depends, of course, on the goals of
the program developers.
A program licensed under the GPL or LGPL, which are copylefting licenses,
has a much lower risk of this occurring (again, program developers
may not perceive this as a risk).
Many people writing libraries want proprietary programs to be able to call
them, so for them the LGPL is a popular choice.
Note that a GPL or LGPL program can be used for commercial gain - you just
can't distribute binaries without distributing their source code.
Of course, if it's your desire that people be able modify the code
and create a proprietary version of it,
then a non-copylefting license should be used instead
(in that case, I'd suggest using the MIT license, which is simpler and clearer
than the BSD licenses).
Some projects are "dual licensed", that is, they are available under multiple
licenses.
<p>
There are legions of articles on licenses, some quite heated.
Evan Leibovitch wrote three columns about them at ZDNet:
(<a href="http://techupdate.zdnet.com/techupdate/stories/main/0,14179,2582875,00.html">Fatal flaw in BSD?</a>,
<a href="http://techupdate.zdnet.com/techupdate/stories/main/0,14179,2587033,00.html">Is the GPL really "user hostile"?</a>
<a href="http://techupdate.zdnet.com/techupdate/stories/main/0,14179,2591417,00.html">When you have Right on your side (or Left, as the case may be)</a>,

thoughtful piece by Jason Earl
on why some BSD advocates are hostile to the GPL</a>.
<a href="http://librenix.com/?inode=22">A posting by Morris McGee
briefly contrasts the GPL and BSD approaches, arguing that both are needed
for OSS/FS development.</a>
Sadly, some of it degenerates into name-calling, with Microsoft calling the
GPL a "virus"; a counter-claim is that the
GPL is a "vaccine against proprietary vendor lock-in".

However, it is true that
licenses are important, because they set the rules for future users and
developers, and any license will restrict what one group or another can do.
<p>
Most OSS/FS developers shouldn't create their own licenses; creating
a good license requires a good lawyer, and the probability of
unintentional incompatibility is great.
Even large organizations are usually poorly served by creating their own
license, since doing so will greatly reduce the amount of possible code reuse
and the size of developers willing to aid the project.
In summary, if you want to develop OSS/FS software,
consider the GPL for applications, the LGPL for libraries (if you want
proprietary applications to call it), and the MIT license if you want your
code incorporated into others' proprietary code.
The BSD-new license is a reasonable alternative to the MIT license.
In particular, it's unwise to create an OSS/FS project using a license
incompatible with the GPL, because such a license bars code sharing with a vast
amount of OSS/FS software;
see my article for more information on
<a href="http://www.dwheeler.com/essays/gpl-compatible.html">why
OSS/FS developers should select a GPL-compatible license</a>.
The LGPL, MIT, and BSD-new licenses are compatible with the GPL.

It's possible to read a number of political approaches into OSS/FS;
at one time some tried to claim that open source was essentially communistic.

Microsoft has attacked open source, particularly the
GNU General Public License (GPL)  - the most widely-used of such software
licenses.
This prompted a letter by Bruce Perens and many other OSS/FS leaders
titled
<a href="http://perens.com/Articles/StandTogether.html">Free Software Leaders Stand Together</a>.
This letter explains, for example,
that ``the business model of Open Source
is to reduce the cost of software development and maintenance by distributing
it among many collaborators.
The success of the Open Source model arises from
copyright holders relaxing their control in exchange for
more and better collaboration.
Developers allow their software to be freely redistributed and modified,
asking only for the same privileges in return.''

More complex web projects may use major libraries or frameworks, such as

<p>
There isn't really one place to find ``all about GNU/Linux'';
you could do worse than looking at the
<a href="http://www.linux.org/info/index.html">linux.org information</a>.
<p>
For information on other packages, you could go to places which track
OSS/FS projects like
<a href="http://freshmeat.net">Freshmeat</a>
(which lists new software available for GNU/Linux and other systems),
the
<a href="http://www.fsf.org/software/software.html">FSF list of free software</a>, and the

<h1><a name="distributions">GNU/Linux Distributions</a></h1>
Few people will want to do all the packaging work for entire
operating systems based on GNU/Linux.
Thus, ``Linux distributors'' sprung up, who do that work and sell
support, extra services, and so on.
Major distributions of GNU/Linux include:
<a href="http://www.redhat.com">Red Hat</a> (#1 in the U.S. by most measures),
<a href="http://www.ubuntu.com">Ubuntu</a> (a derivative of Debian that is one of the widely-used desktop distributions worldwide),
<a href="http://www.debian.org">Debian</a> (#1 non-commercial distribution),
<a href="http://www.suse.com">Novell/SuSE</a> (a major force in Europe),
<!-- <a href="http://www.caldera.com">Caldera</a> (significant for old Novell
and SCO users), -->
<!-- <a href="http://www.turbolinux.com">TurboLinux</a> (significant in Asia) -->
and
<a href="http://www.mandrake.com">Mandrake</a>;
there are many others.
If you're just starting up, I'd suggest trying out
<a href="http://fedoraproject.org/">Fedora</a> (sponsored by Red Hat) and
and
<a href="http://www.ubuntu.com">Ubuntu</a>.
<p>
It's tricky to figure out the market share of GNU/Linux distributions.
An IDC study of copies of GNU/Linux sold in 1999
(<a href="http://news.cnet.com/news/0-1003-200-2662090.html">Red Hat
holds huge Linux lead, rivals growing</a>)
found that
Red Hat shipped 48% and SuSE sold 15%.
<!-- Caldera Systems and TurboLinux each sold 10%,
Mandrakesoft had 4%, Corel 1%, and the others 11%. -->
However, while the market grew 89%, Red Hat's share grew only 69%,
suggesting that Red Hat will have more competition ahead.
<p>
The fundamental failure of these numbers is that they only count sales.
Debian is not usually "sold" in the traditional manner.
A copy of a Linux distribution
can in many cases be downloaded for free (see
<a href="http://www.linuxiso.org">LinuxISO.org</a> for one source), and/or
installed on as many computers as you wish.
Thus, this measure is useful to show that Red Hat is widely used, but
it's less useful in showing true market shares.
<p>
One good source for information on distributions is
<a href="http://www.distrowatch.com">Distrowatch</a>;

<a href="http://www.distrowatch.com/game.htm">The Linux Distribution Game</a>.


<h1><a name="community">Community/News</a></h1>
Open source / free software is a community and culture, not just an idea.
Thus, you can get news and cultural information from some of the following:
<ul>
<li>
<a href="http://lwn.net">Linux Weekly News (LWN)</a>, in my opinion one of the
best news sources; the summarized weekly news comes out every Thursday,
but they release news as it happens.
Other useful news sources include
<a href="http://lxer.com/">LXer</a> (pronounced Elexer, it tries to
link to any related articles on other sites),
and
<a href="http://www.newsforge.com/">NewsForge</a> (similar).

<a href="http://blogs.zdnet.com/open-source/">ZDNet.com's Open Source blog</a>.
<li>
The best source for news specific to the Linux kernel (in my opinion) is
<!-- Formerly http://kt.linuxcare.com, email zbrown@tumblerings.org -->
<a href="http://www.kerneltraffic.org">Kernel Traffic</a>, which provides a
weekly summary of the linux-kernel mailing list
(see the

for general information about this).
Another useful site about the Linux kernel is the

He argues that many of the new and most actively developed

because of various fears.
Programmers fear that their work would be used in a manner
they did not support, and companies fear that their work would be used
by competitors against them.

Some are experimenting with applying open source/free software approaches to
areas other than software and its documentation.
Even many OSS/FS leaders are skeptical, since the attributes of software

if it doesn't work in these other areas people might unreasonably assume it 
can't work in software either.
Still, it will be interesting to see the results of these experiments.

have to pay anything to gain these exclusive rights).
Personally, I believe an activity is going to be far more successful
copying open source methods
when copying the item is essentially free and where collaboration
is like to be produce a better results.
This is more likely to be true for software programs, designs,
documents, and so on, and less true for physical objects.

Karl Fogel's "Recognizing rudeness in the open source culture"</a>,
which argues that "One of the defining characteristics of
open source culture is its distinctive notions of what
does and does not constitute rudeness. While the conventions
described below...  would be familiar to anyone working in mathematics,
the hard sciences, or engineering disciplines....
[in OSS/FS] these conventions are especially likely to
be encountered by people unfamiliar with them...
Technical criticism, even when direct and unpadded, is not rude [and]
Blunt, unadorned questions, are not rude either. Questions that in
other contexts might seem cold, rhetorical, or even mocking,
are often intended seriously, and have no hidden agenda other
than eliciting information as quickly as possible.
The famous technical support question "Is your computer plugged in?"
is a classic example of this. The support person really does
need to know if your computer is plugged in...
The intent is not to insult the recipient, but to quickly rule
out the most obvious (and perhaps most common) explanations."
If you intend to contribute to a project, make sure you learn what the
rules are;
