<h1>Quoter Home Page</h1>
<p>
This is the home page for quoter, a simple tool (filter)
that takes HTML, XML, or SGML files as input and sends them back out
as output with their quotation marks fixed.
It's designed for Unix-like systems (including GNU/Linux);
it may run on Windows, but that is untested
(and you'll need many tools, such as flex and a C compiler, that
come standard with Unix-like systems but take more work to install
on Windows systems).
It is <i>extremely fast</i>, and is smart enough to handle correctly lots of
special cases without help.
<p>
It handles Microsoft's non-standard quotes, typical Unix
conventions (<tt>``</tt> and <tt>''</tt>),
and straight single and double quotes.
It knows to leave untouched anything in comments and scripts, as well as
anything surrounded by &lt;tt&gt;...&lt;/tt&gt; and
&lt;pre&gt;...&lt;/pre&gt;.
<p>
You can freely use, modify, and redistribute it under the terms of the
GPL version 2 or later.
It's a standard source distribution (more technically, an
autoconfiscated tarball), so you can install it normally.
<p>
If you repeatedly reuse quoter
(instead of using it as a one-time repair system),
edit HTML/XML/SGML files using a tool that doesn't insert curling quotes,
and sometimes need both straight quotes and curling quotes in the main body
&mdash; well, you have an incredibly rare requirement.
You can still do that while using quoter; just
use the character encodings of the straight
quote marks (&amp;#34; and &amp;#39;).
Probably the only people who will need
to do this are people who write about character encodings, like me;
normal people can gleefully ignore this suggestion.
