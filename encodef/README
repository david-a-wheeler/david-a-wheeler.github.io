This is the "encodef" suite, a suite of programs that
tries to make it easier to process filenames in Unix*/Linux/POSIX systems.

The main site for this suite is:
 http://www.dwheeler.com/encodef

It's released under the MIT/X11 license (see COPYING).
The author is David A. Wheeler.

Historically, Unix/Linux/POSIX allow almost any byte in a filename,
but this flexibility is the source of many problems.
I describe the problem in
"Fixing Unix/Linux/POSIX Filenames:
Control Characters (such as Newline), Leading Dashes, and Other Problems"
(http://www.dwheeler.com/essays/fixing-unix-linux-filenames.html)
I discuss ways of writing shell programs to work around this,
using existing tools, in
"Filenames and Pathnames in Shell: How to do it correctly"
(http://www.dwheeler.com/essays/filenames-in-shell.html)

We include convenience unmodified copies of some autoconf-archive files,
primarily to turn on various compile-time checks.
If you want to update those files, install autoconf-archive in /usr
(download it, run in its dir "./configure --prefix && make && make install"),
then in this directory run "rm -f m4/ax*".  They will be reloaded.

If you obtain the files via "git", use:
  autoreconf -i

To compile:
  ./configure --prefix=/usr # Or wherever you want to install it.
  make
To run a test suite:
  make test
To install:
  make install

The usual GNU options and DESTDIR are supported, e.g.:
  ./configure --prefix=/usr
  make
  mkdir /tmp/mystuff
  make DESTDIR=/tmp/mystuff install
