	* Version 0.2.
	* Switched to "-b" for PFB aka printf(1) %b encoding; was -e (extra 0)
	* Fixed encodef.1 for -U/-B flags (-U was formerly -p)
	* Added support for -C (just escape control chars) and -S (-C + space)
	* For printf %b, now encode to \a and \\ instead of octal values.
	* For printf %b, null byte is just \0 if followed by non-digit.
