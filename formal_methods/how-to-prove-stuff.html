The real world is a complicated place;
in many cases we don&#8217;t even know the probability of something happening.
Nevertheless, there are a variety of circumstances where
it is important to prove that, given certain reasonable assumptions,
certain conclusions necessarily follow.
<p>
The desire to conclusively prove claims is an ancient desire.
Euclid showed (in geometry) that it was possible to start with a short
list of reasonable assumptions, called axioms,
and then prove an astonishing array of results.
In 1685 Gottfried Leibniz stated in &#8220;The Art of Discovery&#8221; that
&#8220;The only way to rectify our reasonings is to make them as tangible
as those of the Mathematicians, so... when there are disputes... we can
simply say: Let us calculate... to see who is right.&#8221;
At the time, the logic languages necessary to apply to many fields didn&#8217;t
exist, and even if they did, the challenge of applying them manually
would have made them less useful.
<p>
The good news is that
today there are a variety of computer programs and logic systems (languages)
that can help you conclusively prove claims about the real world.
The bad news is that it&#8217;s often hard to find out how to use these tools.
For example, many of their creators assume that users have a vast amount
of mathematical background.
<p>
When I was writing my dissertation
<a href="http://www.dwheeler.com/trusting-trust">
Fully Countering Trusting Trust through Diverse Double-Compiling</a>
I ended up having to learn a lot of poorly-documented &#8220;folklore&#8221;.
In this paper, I briefly provide some &#8220;lessons learned&#8221; that I hope
will help others who want to prove that certain claims are true.
<p>
<h1>Brief Lessons Learned</h1>
<p>
Here are some brief lessons learned:
<ol>
<li>
<i>
Determine your goal (claim) and the basic kinds of assumptions that
you believe will prove it</i>.
You&#8217;ll need to do this in great detail to complete a real proof, but
it&#8217;s important to at first get a basic sense of what you&#8217;re trying to
prove.
Creating a few figures and naming all the &#8220;parts&#8221; of your problem can help.
Proofs always require that you assume <i>something</i>;
trying to prove something from nothing is hopeless.
So, the key is to clarify your goals, and look for
assumptions that you can easily defend to others.
<li>
<i>Learn several different logic languages and their supporting tools,
then choose the
&#8220;weakest&#8221; language that can easily express your assumptions and goals
and the tool that best meets your needs</i>.
There are many different mathematical/logic languages, each with
their strengths and weaknesses.
In general, the more &#8220;expressive&#8221; a language is, the harder it is to
automate... and if it&#8217;s hard to automate, the human ends up with more work
to do to prove things.
I&#8217;ll talk more about this below.
<li>
<i>Tools matter</i>.
Some tools are nicer to work with than others; try out several
before you select one.
<li>
<i>If you're trying to prove something about (a model of) the real world,
then start with an extremely simple model of the world, prove a simplified
claim about that, and then slowly expand</i>.
Trying to model the whole world at once will get you nowhere.
By slowly expanding from a very simple model of the world
that you <i>can</i> prove, you will immediately see
what addition causes problems.
<li>
<i>Generate counter-examples if you cannot prove it</i>.
If you feed assumptions and a goal into a program, and the tool
can&#8217;t prove it,
feed the same thing to a &#8220;model checker&#8221; to generate a counter-example.
(Obviously, this only works if there&#8217;s such a tool for your language.)
The counter-example will show you an example of <i>why</i> you can&#8217;t
prove something, and that may be helpful to you.
<li>
<i>Remember, you must provide all needed assumptions</i>.
A prover can only assume what you give it; if you don&#8217;t state it, it
cannot assume anything.
Some logic languages look like Prolog, but if you&#8217;re familiar with Prolog
this can be misleading.
Prolog presumes
&#8220;negation as failure&#8221;, that is, if it can&#8217;t prove
something is true, then Prolog assumes it&#8217;s false.
General theorem provers make no such assumption!
On the other hand, theorem provers include an &#8220;occurs check&#8221;,
so the kinds of expressions that get Prolog programs into infinite loops
are non-problems for theorem provers.
<li>
<i>Strive to have good, consistent names</i>.
Using clear names and a consistent naming convention can not only make
the final proof clearer, it can also save a lot of time debugging things.
A good name can keep you from making some mistakes in the first place,
simply because some false claims will be &#8220;obviously&#8221; untrue.
Many systems using naming conventions to distinguish between
constants and variables, and some (like prover9) even let you choose
between conventions.
I find that the Prolog convention (uppercase are variables,
lowercase are constants) is simpler to use when modelling the real world
compared to some other conventions, because then it&#8217;s easier to
have clear names.
(The prover9 alternative is that terms beginning with u-z are variables,
but this can lead to odd names if you&#8217;re modelling the real world.)
<li>
<i>Check that your assumptions are consistent</i>.
In most logic systems, if you baldly assume something inconsistent
(such &#8220;a equals b&#8221; <i>and</i> &#8220;a is not equal to b&#8221;), then you can
prove <i>anything</i>.
Thus, once you have your proof, run your assumptions through a
model-checker;
if the model-checker can find a model, then
the assumptions are satisfiable and thus consistent.
See my dissertation
<a href="http://www.dwheeler.com/trusting-trust">
Fully Countering Trusting Trust through Diverse Double-Compiling</a>
for an example of this.
Beware: The word "model" has different meanings.
In this paper and in casual conversation, the word "model" often means
an abstract (and typically mathematical) representation of the real world.
Model-checkers use a different technical definition of the word "model";
in model-checkers, a "model" can considered the set of assignments
that can can meet a given set of assumptions.
<li>
<i>Use a separate verifier</i>.
Proof tools can have bugs, too.
So, have the proof tool output the proof, and then run it through
a separate &#8220;verifier&#8221; program that checks each step.
Verifiers can be much simpler than a program for <i>creating</i> proofs,
so they can act as a good test for whether a proof is true or not.
Not all tools have verifiers, so
you may want to prefer a tool where there&#8217;s a separate verifier.
For example, prover9 proofs can be checked by ivy.
<li>
<i>Have others review the proof</i>.
A prover can prove that some claim is true, given the assumptions,
but it cannot tell you if the claim or assumptions are adequate
models of reality.
Others can tell you where they think your model is inadequate for what
you are trying to prove, warn you of dubious assumptions
(maybe you can break those up into simpler assumptions), and so on.
</ol>

<p>
<h1>Choosing a logic language and tool</h1>
<p>
Unless you <i>want</i> to do things by hand, you&#8217;ll need a tool.
Different tools implement different logic languages, and of course,
the language you use matters greatly.
So in practice, you end up selecting both the logic language and the
tool simultaneously.
(This is a lot like selecting a programming language, really.)

<p>
Unfortunately, the current practice is that you need to
learn a little bit about several different tools and their languages
before you can decide if they&#8217;re right for your problem.
That&#8217;s unfortunate, but probably unavoidable.
In particular, tools tend to add little improvements or extensions that
may or may not be helpful to you.

<p>
My paper
<a href="http://www.dwheeler.com/essays/high-assurance-floss.html">
High Assurance (for Security or Safety) and Free-Libre / Open Source Software (FLOSS)</a> specifically discusses a number of FLOSS formal methods tools
that may be useful to you.
I recommend that you prefer FLOSS proof tools for these purposes;
they cost nothing, aren&#8217;t tied to a particular vendor
(avoiding vendor lock-in),
won&#8217;t disappear on you in the future, and so on.

<p>
There are several different basic logic languages.
Going from weakest to strongest, major types of languages include
propositional logic, first-order logic (FOL),
modal FOL, and higher-order logic (HOL).
([Schumann2001, page 73] has a slightly more complicated summary
about language expressiveness.)
Propositional language is too weak for most ordinary users;
programs that implement propositional languages
(such as SAT solvers) are usually building blocks for creating
larger systems instead of being used directly by end-users.

<p>
I recommend that if you&#8217;re new to this, start by learning
first-order logic (FOL), and see if you can make your problem fit inside FOL.
The modal logic and higher-order logic (HOL) systems can be <i>very</i>
useful, but they are more difficult to automate (thus requiring more
human intervention).
What&#8217;s more, it&#8217;s much easier to learn other systems once you know FOL.

<p>
In practice, real-world languages have lots of extensions and
&#8220;built-in theorems&#8221;.
At the least, almost every tool builds in equality (=), because that&#8217;s
necessary for lots of real work.
Some systems (like prover9) build in list handling, so you can handle
arbitrary-length lists; these can be really useful.
Many systems build in or add various forms of arithmetic;
if you need arithmetic, you <i>need</i> to use such systems
instead of trying to add them yourself.
The program CVC3 is a good program to use if you need something
that includes lots of arithmetic.
Other useful programs include HOL, PVS, and (if you&#8217;re proving programs) ACL2.

<p>
I should warn you that the term &#8220;model&#8221; has two subtly different meanings.
The non-technical term &#8220;model&#8221;
means &#8220;a simplified representation
of the real world&#8221;; in this sense, if you are trying to prove something
about the real world, then your assumptions and goal(s) are
models of the real world.
There&#8217;s also a technical meaning of the term &#8220;model&#8221;
that means
&#8220;an assignment of constants that meet all the given constraints&#8221;;
this is the kind of model that &#8220;model-checkers&#8221; find.
Both meanings are used, and it can be confusing.  Sorry.

<p>
You can see a little more about formal methods in general at my
<a href="http://www.dwheeler.com/formal_methods/">formal methods page</a>.



<p>
<h1>First-Order Logic (FOL)</h1>
<p>
Many provers are based on &#8220;first-order logic&#8221; (FOL).
If you can express your requirements using some version of FOL, then
you can probably use lots of highly-automated tools that actually
<i>create</i> the proof (instead of just checking it).
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=First-order_logic&amp;printable=yes">
Wikipedia&#8217;s
&#8220;First-order logic&#8221; entry has some useful information</a>.
Some people use different symbols for the same concept, and may add or remove
some operations, but once you know one variant
it&#8217;s trivial to learn another variant.
<p>
My dissertation
<a href="http://www.dwheeler.com/trusting-trust">
Fully Countering Trusting Trust through Diverse Double-Compiling</a>
section 5.2 gives a brief summary of FOL in 5.2.
In short, in FOL, every expression is a term or a formula.
A term (which denotes an object) is defined as: a variable, a constant, or a function application of form f(...) where each of the zero or more comma-separated parameters is a term.
A formula (which denotes a truth value of true or false)
is defined as being one of the following (if both A and B are formulas):
<table border="1">
<tr><th>Expression</th><th>Meaning</th></tr>
<tr><td>-A</td><td>&#8220;not A&#8221;. If A is true, then -A is false; if A is false, then -A is true.</td></tr>
<tr><td>A &amp; B</td><td>&#8220;A and B&#8221;.  Both A and B must be true for the expression to be true</td></tr>
<tr><td>A | B</td><td> &#8220;A or B&#8221;. At least one of A or B must be true for the expression to be true.</td></tr>
<tr><td>A -&gt; B</td><td> &#8220;A implies B&#8221; or &#8220;if A, then B&#8221;</td></tr>
<tr><td>A &lt;-&gt; B</td><td>&#8220;A implies B, and B implies A&#8221;. This is a short form of &#8220;(A -&gt; B) &amp; (B -&gt; A)&#8221;</td></tr>
<tr><td>A &lt;- B</td><td>&#8220;B implies A&#8221;; this is just a sometimes-useful reversed form of &#8220;B -&gt; A&#8221;</td></tr>
<tr><td>all X A</td><td> &#8220;for all values of X, A is true&#8221;; X is a variable</td></tr>
<tr><td>exists X A</td><td> &#8220;there exists some X where A is true&#8221;; X is a variable</td></tr>
<tr><td>T1 = T1</td><td> &#8220;T1 equals T2&#8221;; T1 and T2 must be terms</td></tr>
<tr><td>T1 != T2</td><td> &#8220;T1 is not equal to T2&#8221;</td></tr>
<tr><td>p(...)</td><td>predicate (a &#8220;function&#8221; that returns a boolean); each of the 1 or more comma-separated parameters is a term.</td></tr>
</table>
<p>
For example, you can state &#8220;all men are mortal&#8221; in FOL as:
<pre>
  % "For all X, if X is a man, then X is mortal"
  all X man(X) -&gt; mortal(X).
</pre>
You can express &#8220;Socrates is a man&#8221; in FOL as:
<pre>
  man(socrates).
</pre>
From these two statements, you can then prove that Socrates is mortal:
<pre>
  mortal(socrates).
</pre>
<p>
There are endless books and pages on FOL;
a good library and/or a web search should get you started.

&#8220;forall x: An introduction to Formal Logic&#8221; by P.D. Magnus</a>
is an open access introductory textbook in formal logic.

<p>
Here are some external pages on how to convert ideas into FOL:

&#8220;Guide to Axiomatizing Domains in First-Order Logic&#8221; by Ernest Davis</a>
</ul>
<p>
Unfortunately, FOL has some real weaknesses that are easily extended, but
many mathematicians don&#8217;t seem to <i>realize</i> that they are weaknesses.
For example, you can&#8217;t define &#8220;if-then-else&#8221; easily in FOL.
FOL has two &#8220;types&#8221;: formula (essentially booleans) and terms
(everything else).  You can define a multi-parameter object that returns
a boolean (Predicate) or a term (function), but <i>all</i> parameters have
to be terms (non-booleans) - and if-then-else inherently takes a boolean!
<a href="http://www.cs.nyu.edu/pipermail/smt-lib/2003/000018.html">This
email notes why it&#8217;s important to add if-then-else for practical
languages</a>.

<p>
<h1>Prover9/Mace4</h1>
<p>
<a href="http://www.cs.unm.edu/~mccune/mace4/">Prover9/Mace4</a>
(GPLv2+ license) is a really neat combination of tools.
Prover9 can be used to search for a proof, and mace4 can be used to search
for a counter-example, which is an interesting combination.
Prover9&#8217;s language is limited (it&#8217;s basically FOL), but if you
can express your problem using its language, it&#8217;s extraordinarily good at
automatically finding proofs or counter-examples.
Prover9 includes support for equality and lists, and generally it
has a "nice" syntax that's faily close to textbook formats
(making it easy to use).
<p>
Prover9 is a "theorem prover" that works in a way similar to many other
provers.
First, it negates the "goal" statement
(the idea is that you're trying to prove that there's some contradiction).
Then, it tries to generate all possible facts from this set of assumptions
(including the negated goal statement), until it finds a contradiction.
Obviously, this is <i>not</i> the way that a human would work, but
that's okay if you're simply trying to find out if something is true
given certain assumptions.
This works primarily because computers are remarkably fast, and
the developers of prover9 (and other such programs) have honed heuristics
that work in many cases.
<p>
Mace4 and prover9 include <i>limited</i> support for integer arithmetic.
In Mace4 you can turn on arithmetic support with set(arithmetic),
and it's fairly capable.
Historically, prover9 couldn't handle arithmetic at all,
but as of 2008-2009 its "production mode" can do this
(use set(production) to turn this on).
However, production mode
disables many of prover9's other capabilities so this is <i>much</i>
more limited (for example, it won't show the rewrites in the output).
Many problems don't require calculation, and these limited capabilities
may be sufficient for some problems that do.
Prover9 has also recently added an if(boolean,if-term,else-term),
which is very convenient but again has limitations.
If your problem focuses on in-depth arithmetic calculations,
prover9 is probably not the tool for you.
<p>
Prover9 is easy to invoke; just say &#8220;prover9 -f FILE.in&#8221; on the command line,
where FILE.in gives the assumptions and goal to be proved.
The prover9 documentation doesn&#8217;t describe its input format very clearly;
here&#8217;s my attempt at documenting the
<a href="prover9-bnf.txt">prover9 formula syntax (in BNF)</a>.
<!--
In the long term, I might switch to
<a href="http://www.cs.miami.edu/~tptp/TPTP/SyntaxBNF.html">
TPTP syntax</a>
(as
<a href="http://mally.stanford.edu/cm/">Stanford's Computational
Metaphysics project</a> has done), since this is a standard format accepted
by many tools... but prover9/mace4 include tools to translate to/from
TPTP, so I can delay doing that (knowing that I <i>can</i> escape from
the unique format of the tool).
-->

<p>
There&#8217;s a paucity of small, simple examples of prover9 in use.
It's hard to be simpler than
<a href="mortal.in">mortal.in</a>, which is the
"Socrates is mortal" proof in prover9 syntax.

<p>
Here&#8217;s the proof that the square root of 2 is irrational, as
<a href="sqrt2.in">prover9 input</a> and
<a href="sqrt2.xml">prover9 output</a>.
(This is a translation of
the Otter proof from Larry Wos, by Michael Beeson and William McCune,
as published in
<a href="http://www.cs.ru.nl/~freek/comparison/">
&#8220;The Seventeen Provers of the World&#8221;
compiled by Freek Wiedijk</a>).
Here&#8217;s the
<a href="sqrt2.pdf">square root of 2 proof, as a graphic</a>.

<p>
Here&#8217;s another example, <a href="distinct.in">distinct.in</a>, which
defines this predicate:
<pre>
  distinct([First, Second : Rest]) -&gt;
   ( (First != Second) &amp;
     distinct([First : Rest]) &amp;
     distinct([Second : Rest])).
</pre>
The &#8220;distinct&#8221; predicate is useful all by itself, because &#8220;distinct&#8221; makes it
easy to declare that a collection of terms are all different.
Basically, &#8220;distinct&#8221; accepts a list of terms, and then declares that
every term is different from all the other terms.
For example, you can then state that a, b, c, and d are all different
by stating &#8220;distinct([a,b,c,d]).&#8221;.
This is also a useful example of how to do recursive
list-handling in prover9.
<p>
Note: due to technical issues in prover9, if you include this definition
of "distinct" in your assumptions but you never <i>use</i> it,
then you may get a misleading message.
If prover9 can find a proof but "distinct" is not used, it may output
"SEARCH FAILED" followed by "Exiting with 1 proof" (or some other number).
In such cases, prover9 <i>did</i> find a proof, but
thought it had to keep searching.

<p>
Unfortunately, FOL doesn&#8217;t have any built-in notion of type, so
programs like prover9 that implement FOL don&#8217;t have types either.
You can implement types in prover9, using FOL; whether or not you
<i>should</i> do this depends on your problem.
If you add types where they aren&#8217;t needed, then the assumptions,
goal, and proof may become much more complicated.
In my dissertation I decided to discuss types in the informal
text, but not use them in the actual proof.
A <i>trivial</i> way to implement types is to simply make a predicate
that is true if the object is a given type, e.g.:
<pre>
  % human(X) is true if X is human.
  human(abraham_lincoln).
  % penguin(X) is true if X is a penguin.
  penguin(tux).
</pre>
If there are only two types, then it&#8217;s easy to declare that
if something is of one type, then it&#8217;s not of the other type.
Here, we declare that any unknown X cannot be both a human and a penguin:
<pre>
  -(human(X) &amp; penguin(X)).
</pre>
File
<a href="penguin.in">penguin.in shows how to implement simple types
in prover9's first-order logic (FOL)</a>

<p>
That doesn&#8217;t scale well to many types if you want to make
claims about many types.
If you have 30 different types, and an item is at most one of those
types, it&#8217;d be a pain to directly declare that the same way.
Thankfully, you can then use recursion
(just like the &#8220;distinct&#8221; predicate above)
to declare that instances of different types are themselves distinct.
The file
<a href="distinct_types.in">distinct_types.in</a>
shows how to do this.

<p>
You can even define that certain types are subclasses of other classes,
and so on, but again, you have to build that yourself.
The file
<a href="classes.in">classes.in</a>
is a trivial example.

<p>
File
<a href="distinct_classes.in">distinct_classes.in
demonstrates how to implement
partitioned superclasses and subclasses (in a hierarchy), instances of
types, and various facts about them using
in prover9's first-order logic (FOL)</a>.

<p>
My dissertation
