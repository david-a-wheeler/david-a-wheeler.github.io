After poking at the modules, found that there are many options:

One problem: this oddmuse is WAY OLDER than the current one.


"markup" is installed, here is its doc:

But so is usemod, its doc:

[http://www.cs.ru.nl/~freek/100/ "Formalizing 100 Theorems" by Freek Wiedijk] lists 100 mathematical theorems and the various systems that have formalized a nontrivial number of them.  This list is discussed in [http://www.ams.org/notices/200811/tx081101408p.pdf "Formal Proof - Getting Started" (Freek Wiedijk, Notices of the AMS, Volume 55, Number 11, December 2008)]. Rightly or wrongly, this list is used by others to judge proof systems.  Wiedijk's "getting started" picks as its primary examples HOL Light and Mizar, which at the time had the largest number of proofs.  Another example is [http://www.cs.sjsu.edu/faculty/beeson/Masters/KamThesis.pdf "Case Studies in Proof Checking" by Robert C. Kam], which says, "Judging by Dr. Wiedijkâ€™s Formalizing 100 Theorems list, which gives an overview of the headway various proof systems have made in mathematics, Coq and Mizar are two of the most successful systems in use today (Wiedijk, 2007)".

Currently there are 18 proofs proven by Metamath from this list of 100 (including #68, "Sum of an arithmetic series", per the notes below).   As of 2014-02-11 this number of proofs is more than !NuPRL/!MetaPRL (8) or PVS (16), and the same as nqthm/ACL2 (18).  However, this is far short of HOL Light (86), Mizar (57), Isabelle (52), Coq (49) or !ProofPower (42). This is still pretty good considering that there had been no concerted effort to prove theorems from this list of 100.

Here is the list of the [http://www.metamath.org/ metamath] proofs that are available from this list of 100, along with credit to the individual(s) who created the Metamath formalization. Please add missing entries!

The following theorems are *not* known to be proven using metamath, even though there are proofs of theorems with similar-sounding names:

* 2. Fundamental Theorem of Algebra ([http://us.metamath.org/mpegif/1arith2.html 1arith2] is not the same)
* 5. Prime Number Theorem ([http://us.metamath.org/mpegif/prime.html prime] is not the same)

Note that there are pages similar to this one for other tools, such as these pages on [http://www.cs.ru.nl/~freek/100/hol.html HOL] and [http://www.cs.ru.nl/~freek/100/mizar.html Mizar].

This metamath list was originally developed by David A. Wheeler and Norman Megill.
