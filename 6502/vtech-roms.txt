Dear David,

Thank you for your email.

We have no problem to release the code but it will take some time for us to
find it out, as it is a very old product. We will keep you posted on any
update.

Regards,
Corporate Communications Department

Dear VTech,

Would you please release the VTech Laser 128 ROM as open source software?
Below I will explain what I mean, and why I am asking this.

In the 1980s and early 1990s, VTech produced the "Laser 128", a clone of
the Apple //c computer.  This computer is obsolete today. However, it is
important to history, and a small group of hobbyists like to work with it.
A key part of this computer was the software built into the computer
itself, the "ROM".

Other obsolete programs of that time have been released as "open source
software".  Open source software is software where anyone is allowed to
view, modify, and re-release it; these rights enable people to reuse them
and update them (e.g., so that they can work with modern equipment).
Communities often coalesce to maintain these obsolete programs, without
cost to the original developers.  CP/M has been released as open source
software, for example.

Would VTech please release, as open source software, the portions of the
Laser 128 ROMs that they developed?  Vtech will not be selling more Laser
128s, while releasing this software would help ensure that its legacy will
be available to the future.  This would also meet the "Corporate Social
Responsibility" of Vtech, such as supporting communities (especially
education).

Thank you for your time.
