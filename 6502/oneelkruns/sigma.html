<h2>Sigma Software Package Disk - 1983</h2>
<hr>
This disk contains the Apple II software sold by my high school science club.  We wrote all of
these programs ourselves (ok, Manson wrote most of them, I wrote a few)  There are some classic
games here, as well as stirling examples of what can happen when silly high school students get
their hands on a computer.
<p>
Minimum requirements:  <b>Apple II+ with 48k RAM **</b><p>
(** archive is a DOS 3.3 disk but must be expanded on a ProDOS system using ShrinkIt)
<hr>
<p>
Download: <a href="sigma1.zip">
 SIGMA.SDK</a> - ShrinkIt archive, or 
<a href="sigma2.zip">
 SIGMA.ZIP</a> - Zipped disk image for emulators, ProDOS order
<p>
<b>Just a few of the exciting and novel programs available to you at no charge!</b>
<p>
<ul>
<li><b>ALIEN DEATH</b> - You're gonna die.  Just pick where.. but choose wisely!
<li><b>QUELPNEG DEFENSE</b> - Battle fierce aliens before they can destroy the Earth!
<li><b>SAVAGE TERROR</b> - Must be seen to be believed!
<li><b>PLUTONIAN RAIDERS</b> - Choose wisely and defend your moonbase
<li><b>CIRCUS APPLE</b> - Collect that garbage!
<li><b>BILL THE MONK</b> - Watch Bill the Monk on his way to the monestary [sic]
<li><b>NOOB ESSAY</b> - >Random sentences with sometimes hilarious results!

    Will work with ProDOS disks.
</ul>
