<p>
<h1>The Problem</h1>
<p>
Many people find Lisp s-expressions hard to read as a programming notation.
I've developed Lisp programs for decades, and though I can read s-expressions
well, I remain dissatisfied with their syntactic limitations.
Others, including Lisp luminary Paul Graham, feel the same way.
(<a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2009/12/01/Clojure-Theses">
Tim Bray loves Clojure, but not its syntax</a>.)
Yet s-expressions have a lot of benefits to them, and it turns out
to be <i>very</i> hard to design a more readable notation
that retains all the benefits of s-expressions.
But I believe it <i>is</i> possible - so let's try!
<p>
This web page identifies some ways to extend/modify
s-expressions so they can be more readable <i>without</i> losing their power
(such as homoiconicity, generality, macros, quasiquoting,
and easily-manipulated program fragments).
A vast number of projects have tried to create "a more readable
Lisp notation" and failed, including M-expressions, IACL2, and Dylan.
In hindsight, it's clear that they failed because they didn't have some
key advantages of S-expressions, in particular, that they are generic
(they do not depend on some underlying semantic)
and homoiconic (the underlying data structure is clear from the syntax).
Since these old "readable Lisp" syntaxes weren't generic or homoiconic,
they could not handle semantic change and metaprogramming - yet
those are some of the very reasons someone would use a Lisp!
Now that we know <i>why</i> those efforts failed, we can avoid their mistakes.
<p>
My goal is to spur work to create one or more readable, general-purpose,
homoiconic notations for s-expressions that do a good job representing
programs.  A good way to measure that is to see that it should be easy
to translate back and forth between arbitrary S-expressions and this other
notation (by computer and in people&#8217;s heads).
<p>
If you are unwilling to consider that there might be a better approach,
<a href="retort-lisp-can-be-readable.html">read my retort/rebuttal that
Lisp can be readable</a>.
If you're still unwilling to consider alternatives, stop reading.
But if you're interested in developing a better way, keep reading.
After all, the quote operator ' did not fall from the sky - it was not
in the original Lisps, and was added because that construct was so
common that it was worth creating an abbreviation.
We're just adding new abbreviations.
On this page, I explain how to get involved, present my 3-layer approach
(curly infix, modern-expressions, and sweet-expressions),
and point to others' approaches to the problem.

<h1>How to discuss solutions</h1>
<p>
Interested?
Please
<a href="https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/readable-discuss">
join the readable-discuss mailing list</a> of
<a href="http://readable.sourceforge.net">
SourceForge project "readable"</a>.

<p>
This project exists to discuss options for taming s-expressions,
and then develop and distribute open source software to implement those ideas.
<a href="http://www.mail-archive.com/readable-discuss@lists.sourceforge.net/">
See the mail-archive archives of the readable Lisp archive</a>
to see what we've discussed so far.

<h1>Curly Infix, Modern-expressions, and Sweet-expressions</h1>
<p>
I've developed a 3-layer approach to making Lisp more readable, which
is all based on creating simple abbreviations that work on
<i>any</i> S-expression:
<ol>
<li><i>Curly infix</i>: Any expression surrounded by {...} is merely
an abbreviation for an infix expression.
So {n&nbsp;&lt;=&nbsp;2} maps to (&lt;=&nbsp;n&nbsp;2),
{2&nbsp;*&nbsp;3&nbsp;*&nbsp;4} maps to (*&nbsp;2&nbsp;3&nbsp;4), and
{2&nbsp;+&nbsp;{3&nbsp;*&nbsp;4}} maps to (+&nbsp;2&nbsp;(*&nbsp;3&nbsp;4)).
By intent there is <i>no</i> precedence and embedded infix expressions must use another {...}.
<li><i>Modern-expressions</i>: This takes curly infix, and adds special meanings
to the prefixed grouping symbols (), [], and {}.
Thus, f(1&nbsp;2) maps to (f&nbsp;1&nbsp;2).
<li><i>Sweet-expressions</i>: Includes modern-expressions, and adds the idea that
indentation is meaningful (like Python, Haskell, and many other languages).
</ol>
<p>
All of these can be used in <i>any</i> Lisp-like language
(Common Lisp, Scheme, Emacs Lisp, ACL2, BitC,
<a href="http://clipsrules.sourceforge.net/">CLIPS</a>, etc.).
Curly-infix is 100% compatible with existing code; modern-expressions
and sweet-expressions are 100% compatible with well-formatted code.

<h2>Sweet-Expression Examples</h2>
Let's do two quick examples -  we'll use sweet-expressions version 0.2
to represent calculating factorials and Fibonacci numbers,
in both cases using Scheme:

<br>
<br>
<!-- <table cellpadding="4" border="1">-->
<table cellpadding="4" border="1" rules="cols">
<tr>
<th align="center">(Ugly) S-expression</th>
<th align="center">Sweet-expression 0.2</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="left" valign="top">
<pre>
(define (fibfast n)
  (if (&lt; n 2)
    n
    (fibup n 2 1 0)))
</pre>
</td>
<td align="left" valign="top">
<pre>
define fibfast(n)  ; Typical function notation
  if {n &lt; 2}       ; Indentation, infix {...}
    n              ; Single expr = no new list
    fibup(n 2 1 0) ; Simple function calls
</pre>
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td align="left" valign="top">
<pre>
(define (fibup max count n-1 n-2)
  (if (= max count)
    (+ n-1 n-2)
    (fibup max (+ count 1) (+ n-1 n-2) n-1)))
</pre>
</td>
<td align="left" valign="top">
<pre>
define fibup(max count n-1 n-2)
  if {max = count}
    {n-1 + n-2}
    fibup max {count + 1} {n-1 + n-2} n-1
</pre>
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td align="left" valign="top">
<pre>
(define (factorial n)
  (if (&lt;= n 1)
    1
    (* n (factorial (- n 1)))))
</pre>
</td>
<td align="left" valign="top">
<pre>
define factorial(n)
  if {n &lt;= 1}
    1
    {n * factorial{n - 1}} ; f{...} =&gt; f({...})
</pre>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>
Note that you can use traditional math notation
for functions;
<tt>fibfast(n)</tt> maps to <tt>(fibfast&nbsp;n)</tt>.
Infix processing is marked with {...};
<tt>{n&nbsp;&lt;=&nbsp;2}</tt> maps to <tt>(&lt;=&nbsp;n&nbsp;2)</tt>, and
<tt>f{n&nbsp;*&nbsp;2}</tt> maps to <tt>(f&nbsp;(*&nbsp;n&nbsp;2))</tt>.
Indentation is significant, unless disabled by (...), [...], or {...}.
This example uses variable names with embedded "-" characters; that's
not a problem, because the infix operators must be surrounded by whitespace
and are only used when {...} requests them.
<p>
It's actually quite common to have a function call pass one parameter,
where the parameter is calculated using infix notation.
Thus, there's a rule to simplify this common case (the prefix {} rule).
So factorial{n&nbsp;-&nbsp;1} maps to
factorial({n&nbsp;-&nbsp;1}) which maps to
(factorial&nbsp;(-&nbsp;n&nbsp;1)).
<p>
Credit where credit is due: The Fibonacci number code is loosely based on
<a href="http://hansonchar.blogspot.com/2006/01/fibonacci-numbers-in-scheme.html
">an example by Hanson Char</a>.

<p>
It's a joy to use at the command line; with sweet-expressions, you can
type in simple-to-read expressions and have the system immediately respond.

<h2>More information about Sweet-expressions</h2>
<p>
Interested? You can get:
<ul>
<li>
<a href="tutorial-sweet-expressions.html">Tutorial on Sweet-expressions: A readable format for Lisp-like languages</a> gives a brief tutorial, and it focuses on actually trying out the demo code that implements this idea.
You don't need to know much about Lisp-like languages; if you know how to program you should be able to follow along (though Lisp knowledge helps).
<li>
<a href="sweet-expressions.html">Sweet-expressions: A readable format for Lisp-like languages</a> is more in-depth, explaining the rules and why.
It assumes you know something about Lisp-like languages.
</ul>
<p>
From the SourceForge page (noted above) you can download implementations.
There's a production-ready Common Lisp implementation of curly infix,
and a reasonably complete (though work is still ongoing) Scheme implementation
of Sweet-expressions.

<h2>Analysis of alternatives</h2>
<p>
If you want even more detail, look here:
<ul>
<li><a href="version02.html">The Sweet-expressions version 0.2 page</a>
shows examples and experimentation that led to sweet-expressions
version 0.2, including the split into three layers and removing
automatic determination of infix operators.
The latter was a surprise; I thought automatically determining infix would
be a big advantage, but the experiments suggested otherwise.
It shows sweet-expressions using samples of <i>many</i> different
Lisp-based languages - this shows that sweet-expressions are <i>not</i>
tied to a particular semantic.
<li>
<a href="readable-s-expressions.html">
My older paper
"Readable s-expressions and sweet-expressions: Getting the infix fix and fewer parentheses in Lisp-like languages"</a>
has <i>lots</i> more information.
It's the original paper I used to
identify and discuss various ways to make s-expressions to read.
It identifies three approaches that seem particularly promising:
indentation, name-prefixing (so func(x y) is the same as (func x y)),
and infix support.
In the process of creating sweet-expressions, I went through many
alternatives, and wrote down in this paper what I learned as I went.
It turns out that many people have tried to solve this problem but foundered;
I think by learning from their problems I've got a better mousetrap.
You may find my thoughts helpful!
This resulted in the development of sweet-expressions version 0.1.
</ul>

<h2>Implementation approaches</h2>
<p>
I want to have final sweet-expression readers that
work on Scheme, Common Lisp, emacs Lisp, and ACL2 at least,
without having to implement it multiple times.
Scheme is in some ways the most strict of the these,
e.g., it's picky about the meaning of a boolean value,
what is at the end of a list, and the legal names of parameters.
Thus, I've been implementing sweet-expressions in
a small subset of "easily translatable"
Scheme, so that it can eventually be auto-translated to other Lisps.
(It's easier to translate from more-picky Scheme to others than vice-versa.)
<a href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/moore/publications/hyper-card.html">
ACL2 has a very short list of built-ins</a>, which are
similar to Scheme's, so this seems plausible.
Perhaps I could use
<a href="http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/dorai/">Dorai Sitaram's
Scmxlate Scheme translate tool (LGPL license)</a> so that I could write
a single implementation and have it be useful in Common Lisp (CL) and ACL2
as well.
<!-- There's also:
http://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs/project/ai-repository/ai/lang/scheme/impl/pseudo/0.html
but I found no license info.
-->
The final program will be so small
that a specialized program to do the translation might be enough.
<p>
One nastiness about this technique:
In Scheme, recursion is how you do everything.
In Common Lisp, tail recursion isn't guaranteed.
However, tail recursion is
a very common optimization in simple cases, e.g., where
a function tail recurses into itself.
In ACL2, mutually-recursive
functions have to be declared, which is annoying -
but they <i>can</i> occur.
In fact, ACL2's only iteration technique is recursion.
Emacs lisp doesn't optimize tail recursion at all, but since code doesn't
require a deep stack that should be okay.
<a href="http://www.accesscom.com/~darius/writings/scheme-for-lispers.html">
Scheme for Common Lispers</a> discusses differences between Scheme and CL, as
does the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Lisp">Wikipedia article on
Common Lisp</a>.
<a href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~novak/schemevscl.html">Here's a
convenient table of Common Lisp/Scheme function "equivalences"</a>.
<a href="http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/cce/acl2/">DrACuLa combines
ACL2 with DrScheme</a>, and
<a href="http://lambda-the-ultimate.org/node/1343">this page discusses
combining ACL2 with DrScheme</a> (basically, ACL2 builds on just a few
primitives, so DrScheme just implemented those and ACL2 showed up!).
<p>
Ideally, an implementation should go both ways
(translate text to S-expressions, and
pretty-print S-expressions as indented with infix format).
It should be absolutely rock-solid (maybe even proved).
It should also provide a "check for change" tool, e.g., read in some
text using the 'regular' read and the indented, and make sure there's
no change.

<h1>Why am I bothering?</h1>
<p>
I'm very interested in improving the security and safety of programs.
Doing that well requires good program analysis tools.
S-expressions have proven themselves, over many decades,
to be a very good tool for creating programs to
transform or analyze programs (or other symbolic systems).
Many proving tools such as ACL2 and PVS are based on s-expressions,
as well as existing computer alegebra tools like
<a href="http://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/axiom">Axiom</a> and
Maxima.
<p>
Sadly, traditional s-expressions are nearly unreadable to most people,
making them difficult to use, and a notoriously poor way to communicate
with a wider world.
Its inability to properly support infix notation directly -
a basic starting point for symbolic manipulation of mathematics -
is laughable in the 2000s.
By having a <i>readable</i> notation for s-expressions, I hope to be able to
spur on better abilities for programs that analyze programs... resulting
(perhaps) in more secure and safe programs.
<p>
Besides, I'm drawn like a moth to the flame of "impossible" problems.
For more proof of this character flaw, see my
