; Implementation of a revision of SRFI-49.  The original SRFI-49
; was developed by Egil Möller, and revised by David A. Wheeler. See:

; WARNING - this approach will probably be abandoned; see sugar.scm.

;
; This provides "Indentation-sensitive syntax" for Scheme.
; This SRFI descibes a new syntax for Scheme, called I-expressions,
; with equal descriptive power as S-expressions. The syntax uses
; indentation to group expressions, and has no special cases for
; semantic constructs of the language. It can be used both for
; program and data input.

; The following code implements I-expressions as a GNU Guile module
; that can be loaded with (use-modules (sugar)).

; This is a major re-implementation of I-expressions by
; David A. Wheeler, with some small snippets from the code by
; Egil Möller.  The key is that this code is intentionally modelled
; after the production rules of the specification - so it's more likely
; to (1) be correct, and (2) have other people BELIEVE it's correct.

; I-expressions: Detailed Specification
; David A. Wheeler
; 2008-01-06
; 
; SRFI-49 (http://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-49/srfi-49.html dated 2005/05/29)
; provides a pretty good system for indentation, but there are some issues
; with it.  The spec has a few errors, and the BNF productions don't
; include much information on the whitespace-handling (which may explain
; why the sample implementation has bugs in handling comments in certain
; constructs).  Instead, much of the whitespace handling is described
; only informally.  In addition, the sample code isn't obviously related
; to the BNF productions, so it's difficult to be confident that the code
; is correct even if its known bugs were fixed.
; 
; So, below are step-by-step transforms of the
; SRFI-49 rules.  The first one is a mild "fix-up" of the SFRI rules;
; the second takes the first and adds whitespace rules that are
; (mostly) implicit in the text, as well as proposing a way to deal
; with "initial indent".  The goal is to make the specification more
; detailed, in a step-by-step fashion, and then create an implementation
; that is "obviously correct" from the detailed spec.
; That way, we can be much more confident that the code is correct.
; 
; ===========================================================
; The SRFI-49 spec productions are modified as follows:
; 
; (1) Fix spec bug: the "head" productions' "expr" are changed to "s-expr"
; 
; (2) Fix spec bug: the rule for "head-> s-expr" is changed from "(list expr)"
;     to "(list $1)"
; 
; (3) Fix spec bug: the missing rule for UNQUOTE-SPLICING has been added
; 
; (4) Editorial: rules are reordered so the GROUP productions are adjacent
; 
; (5) Relaxation of rule: This version adds a "start-expr" production,
;     which defines reading the first line of an expression, and adds a new
;     rule to permit indented initial lines:
;         start-expr -> INDENT expr DEDENT
; 
;     Rationale: The original specification completely forbid initial
;     indentation, but this turns out to have been overly strict.  See below
;     for details about various alternatives. This alternative was selected
;     because it has the "obvious" meaning, yet does NOT require "read"
;     to store hidden indentation state after returning.  Many other
;     alternatives required hidden state or could be easily misleading
;     (resulting in subtle bugs).  This means that if initial expressions
;     are all indented, they must be separated with blank lines.
; 
; (6) Proposed bug-fix: After the FIRST line of an expression, any
;     line with ONLY zero or more spaces and tabs, and no ;-comment,
;     ENDS the expression.
; 
;     This is only a small change from the spec text as literally written.
;     A line with zero or more horizontal whitespace characters followed by
;     a ;-comment, aka an "empty line", is (still) ALWAYS ignored
;     and not considered for indentation processing. In addition,
;     a line with ONLY horizontal whitespace characters, aka a
;     "blank line" (it has only blanks), is (still) ignored and skipped
;     when reading the first line of an expression (and not considered
;     for identation processing).
; 
;     Rationale: If the spec were followed literally, interactive use
;     would be quite unpleasant. That's because the results of an
;     expression would NEVER be written until after the next
;     expression's first line was entered, which is very confusing.
;     Here, pressing "Enter Enter" (a blank line) causes execution, which is
;     much clearer.
; 
;     The modification also states that lines with JUST spaces and tabs
;     would be considered the same as a line with no characters at all.
;     Otherwise, printed and displayed text could not be understood with
;     certainty - a line that looked completely blank COULD mean either
;     "expression completed" OR "expression continues", depending on the
;     invisible whitespace indentation - leading to hard-to-debug code.
;     What's worse, many tools (including editors and email clients) quietly
;     remove trailing whitespace, so differentiating between lines that
;     have only spaces/tabs from lines with no characters can lead to
;     many quiet changes in code meaning.
; 
;     Note that the sample implementation (in the spec) does not follow the
;     spec production rules - it DOES return on empty lines in
;     some circumstances.  So this is considered a bug in the production rules.
; 
;     As noted in its spec, I-expressions were specifically designed
;     so that they will work the same way whether they are entered
;     interactively or via a file, enabling cut-and-paste
;     and avoiding the complexities of a "mode" flag (which can be hard

; ===========================================================
; Detailed version of spec
; 
; The original spec described primarily in words what to do about whitespace.
; This can make it difficult to implement with certainty, so the following
; is a more detailed version of the production rules, but with whitespace
; rules made explicit as part of the productions (instead of being
; implicit in the English text).
; 
; Instead of having an anonymous "whitespace preprocessor", we will
; define a special rule that can consume a line's initial indentation, and
; compare that with the currently-active indentation.
; It can then produce INDENT, DEDENT, or SAME (for the same indentation).
; During processing of the start-expr rule, the "current" indentation is
; the empty string, and it can start immediately (since this rule only
; applies to new lines).  For the rest of the rules, INDENT, DEDENT or
; SAME can only match if the currently-being-processed character is newline
; or EOF.  It will match INDENT if the new line is further indented,
; DEDENT for each level of dedenting, and SAME if it's the same level of
; indenting.
; 
; Note that EOF can start a whole new expression, but can't be in
; the middle of one.  Thus, a ' followed by EOF is not legal, but
; EOF is perfectly legal result of start_expr (it's how a correctly-terminated
; file would end).
; 
; A current proposal is to treat as line with only horizontal
; whitespace as if it's a line solely with newline - i.e.,
; as if the horizontal whitespace didn't even exist.
; After all, you can't see the difference when printing,
; and typically can't see them when editing either.
; This appears to be the safer alternative.
; That's what the text below does.
; 
; The following is psuedocode for key functions, followed by
; modified productions that add specific rules for whitespace processing
; (instead of the English descriptions):
; 
; define get-leading-hspace()
;    {sequence <- get/consume sequence of spaces and tabs}
;    if pair?(memv(peek-char() '(NL EOF)))
;       ""  ; if newline (no ;), treat as newline-by-self. Don't consume here.
;       sequence ; return new indent level
; 
; Here's the whitespace processor, described
; in pseudocode using sweet-expressions 0.2.
; This is called when INDENT/SAME/DEDENT are being matched; we know we
; have one (it begins with a newline after start-expr), but we need
; to figure out which one.
; 
; define process-line-begin()
;   ; Used by the productions OTHER that start-expr; consume the newline
;   ; (which is the current character if you peek), and return the new
;   ; indentation text.  Do NOT use this in start-expr, because start-expr
;   ; need NOT begin with a newline.
;   ; Use "whats-indent" to see if the indentation text returned is
;   ; an INDENT, SAME, DEDENT, or an error.
;   ; The following consumes the newline - and complains if it's NOT a newline
;   if {(read-char) char-ne? #\newline) error("process-line-begin miscalled")
;   {new-indent <- get-leading-hspace()}
;   cond
;     {peek() = #\; }       ; Comment-only line?
;       get-comment()       ; Yes, ignore comment-only lines -
;       consume-nl-ifany()  ; even their indentation is irrelevant.
;       process-line-begin()
;     #t
;       new-indent
;   ; Note: This won't consume "return" when we have a line with no characters,
;   ; or ONLY spaces/tabs.  Instead, it will return all the way back up to
;   ; start-expr.  If we're processing something, it will eventually return
;   ; to complete a start-expr, which returns with the expression.
;   ; If we're _already_ in start-expr, then start-expr will just consume the
;   ; blank line and keep going.
; 
; define whats-indent(old-indent new-indent)
;   cond
;     {new-indent > old-indent}  return(INDENT)
;     {new-indent = old-indent}  return(SAME)
;     {new-indent < old-indent}  return(DEDENT)
;     #t                         error("Incomparable indents")
;   
; 
; 
; Here are the modified production rules, making whitespace explicit.
; The expectation is that in the implementation, each of these nonterminals
; would be implemented by a function; one of its input parameters would be
; the current indentation, and each would return
; (new-indentation result-so-far).  A function can compare the indentation
; that it received when it started with a new-indentation returned
; using what-indent.  Note that some of the $values are changed in below,
; because when the whitespace symbols were inserted they caused the positions
; of the other non-terminals to change.  In some cases $last is used, so that
; it'd be more likely to be right as the text below was edited.
; 
;   ; Definitions of whitespace:
;   eol -> comment? eol-final               ; eol = "end of line"
;   comment -> ";" (not NL|EOF)*   ; Note: does not consume NL or EOF.
;   eol-final -> NL | EOF
;   hspace -> SPACE | TAB
; 
;   ; Start-up is special (esp. for EOF handling).
;   ; INDENT-NO-NL, DEDENT-NO-NL, and SAME-NO-NL are like INDENT, DEDENT, and
;   ; SAME, but they do NOT start with a newline.  Thus, they do NOT consume
;   ; an initial newline.  We use these, because in start-expr we are ALREADY
;   ; at the start of a new line, while in all other productions, we don't
;   ; transition to a new line until we see the newline character.
; 
;   start-expr -> hspace* comment? EOF
;     ; Consume this EOF, in case it's interactive - all others should be peeked
;     ; Note: get hspace* using get-leading-hspace, and NOT by skipping the
;     ; space (because we need to retain those characters for examination)
;     ; and NOT by invoking process-line begin (because that presumes that we're
;     ; beginning with a newline, not necessarily true here)
;     $last ; EOF is legal at top level (here).  Note that '<EOF> isn't legal
;   start-expr -> hspace* comment? NL start-expr
;     $last ; skip any initial content-free lines.
;   start-expr -> INDENT-NO-NL expr DEDENT-NO-NL
;     $2 ; Use "most consistent" approach for handling toplevel indents.
;     ; Note that DEDENT-NO-NL does NOT consume a newline; that was already
;     ; done in expr.
;   start-expr -> expr SAME-NO-NL
;     $1 ; this is an expression starting at the left edge.
;     ; Notice that we have no way of knowing when we're "done" until we
;     ; read the next line, and see that it has effectively a left-edge-start
;     ; (because it's a whitespace-only line, or because it's another expr
;     ; starting at the left edge).  Note that SAME-NO-NL does NOT consume a
;     ; newline; that consumption was already done by expr.
; 
;   ; "expr" describes a single expression/datum.
;   ; Abbreviations; these are considered first (have higher priority)
;   ; that the abbreviation processing built into the nonterminal "s-expr".
;   ; That way, we do NOT leave indentation processing merely because we had
;   ; one of the standard abbreviations, preventing certain misleading formats.
;   expr -> QUOTE hspace* SAME? expr
;    (list 'quote $last)
;   expr -> QUASIQUOTE hspace* SAME? expr
;    (list 'quasiquote $last)
;   expr -> UNQUOTE hspace* SAME? expr   ; , without a following @
;    (list 'unquote $last)
;   expr -> UNQUOTE-SPLICING hspace* SAME? expr  ; ,@
;    (list 'unquote-splicing $last)
;   ; Note: Abbreviations only accept expr at their tail; they
;   ; do NOT (by intent) accept "INDENT body DEDENT" instead of expr.
;   ; If they did, that would imply that abbreviations can have multiple
;   ; arguments (because bodies can have more than one entry) - but they can't!
;   ; Thus, if an abbreviation symbol is followed by hspace* newline,
;   ; the next line (that isn't a comment-only line) must have the SAME
;   ; indentation level. This prevents nonsense like a ' with two arguments.
;   ; Notice that an expr is required after an abbreviation,
;   ; so '<EOF> is not legal.
; 
;   ; In actual code, you can't distinguish between GROUP and head until the
;   ; leading s-expr is read in.  So in the implementation:
;   ;   * peek at the first character - remember if it is G/g or not.
;   ;   * read in the s-expr
;   ;   * if the s-expr is the symbol "group", _and_ the first peeked character
;   ;     was G/g, then it is GROUP... else it is not.
;   ;
;   expr -> GROUP hspace* head INDENT body DEDENT
;    (append $3 $5)
;   expr -> GROUP hspace* comment? INDENT body DEDENT
;    $4
;   expr -> GROUP hspace* head
;    (if (= (length $last) 1)
;        (car $last)
;      $last)
;   expr -> head INDENT body DEDENT
;    (append $1 $3)
;   expr -> head  ; followed by DEDENT or SAME
;    (if (= (length $1) 1)
;        (car $1)
;      $1)
; 
;   ; "head" describes multiple datums on one line:
;   head -> s-expr hspace* head ; typically hspace+.
;    (append $1 $3)
;   head -> s-expr hspace* comment?
;    (list $1)
;    ; this is the terminating production (the other one recurses to "head");
;    ; this production is followed by EOF or newline (newline is represented
;    ; here as part of the indentation token)
; 
;   ; "body" describes the sequence of child lines.
;   ; It's impossible to have the sequence INDENT DEDENT, there MUST be
;   ; something in between.  Thus, when body is first called, it cannot
;   ; match the "empty" rule of the I-expression spec.  Thus, we'll rewrite
;   ; the rule as a body followed by body-tail, because that's
;   ; easier to implement.
;   body -> expr body-tail
;     (cons $1 $last)
;   body-tail -> SAME body
;     $1
;     ; It's another line at the SAME indentation, so we have another body.
;   body-tail ->
;     '()
;     ; No more children.  This will be a DEDENT in caller,
;     ; ending the sequence of bodies. But the DEDENT is actually
;     ; consumed by the caller (one of the expr productions),
;     ; not this production, so we'll write the production rule this way.
;     ; If it's DEDENT, we've ended the list of bodies.
;     ; Note: It would be illegal to be INDENT; INDENT would be handled
;     ; by expr, not body.
; 
;   ; s-expr is a traditional s-expr, aka datum.  It does NOT begin with
;   ; ";", hspace, NL, or EOF.
;   ; To implement it, the I-expression reader presumably calls on
;   ; the _previous_ "read" routine for datum.
;   ; When processing "expr", the special definitions for
;   ; abbreviations QUOTE etc. take precedence, so that indentation
;   ; processing is not accidentally disabled. But, if you're processing
;   ; the later entries of "head" (i.e., datums that are NOT the first
;   ; datum on the line), the s-expr reader must handle the abbreviations.
;   ; Users could abuse this to make ugly-looking code, but unlike the
;   ; case of the initial expr, this wouldn't confuse the indentation...
;   ; once you're processing later datums on a line, if the line ends in
;   ; an abbreviation, then the next line's indentation is ignored since we
;   ; KNOW we're trying to read in exactly one datum.
;   ; Use a style checker if you want to curb the worst abuses.
; 
; 
; 
; Note: I-expressions do not provide special syntax for improper lists,
; e.g., (a . b).  When you need them, just use s-expressions or cons.
; A _syntax_ for this would be easy, e.g., rules like:
;   head -> s-expr hspace+ "." hspace+ s-expr
; However, it'd be hard to IMPLEMENT, because "." is a leading character
; for many different circumstances (.9, ..., etc.), yet calling the
; underlying reader might not be effective.  E.G., clisp's "read" will
; fail if given a solo ".".  There doesn't seem to be a compelling need
; anyway; you can use s-expressions or cons to construct these,
; and there's an implementation headache to create
; another syntax in I-expressions to implement them.
; 
; Other than in start-expr, "INDENT" matches newline followed by a deeper
; indentation than the current one.  Similarly for SAME and DEDENT.
; Thus, INDENT/SAME/DEDENT only match in non-initial lines streams that
; begin with newline or EOF... and obviously, INDENT can't match an EOF.
; 
; On a match, all the matching characters (and only those) should be
; consumed.  The exception is EOF: Except for the first rule of
; start-expr, "peek" for EOF and don't consume it.
; 
; Note some invariants:
; * You can't follow DEDENT/SAME/INDENT with any hspace - it'd be ambiguous.
;   - Therefore, expr, head, and body can't begin with an hspace.
; 
; Goals:
; * Inside a line, you should be able to separate s-expr with hspace+
; * hspace* should be okay at the end of each line, with unchanged meaning.
;   - This is handled by a "head" production
; 
; ========================
; Whitespace problems in original spec
; 
; Unfortunately, there are several problems in the original spec
; regarding the handling of lines that contain 0+ spaces or tabs,
; possibly followed by a ;-leading comment.
; 
; The original final I-expression spec says:
; "Unfortunately, [in Python] the syntaxes of file input and
; interactive input differs slightly...
; [In I-expressions,]
; Each line in a file is either empty (contains only whitepace and/or a
; comment), or contains some code, preceeded by some number of space and/or tab
; characters.
; In the following syntax definition, this initial space, as well as linebreaks,
; is not included in the rules. Instead, preceding any matching, the leading
; space of each line is compared to the leading space of the last non-empty line
; preceeding it, and then removed. If the line is preceeded by more space than
; the last one was, the special symbol INDENT is added..."
; 
; Thus, in the original spec, a line with only horizontal whitespace,
; optionally trailed by a comment (presumably a ;-comment), was ignored after
; the first line of an expression.  But this says nothing about what
; happens on the FIRST line of an expression; some clarification is needed.
; 
; In addition, the text above implies that in I-expressions,
; the file input and interactive input formats are the same.
; Yet this is improbable as stated.  The "obvious" reading of the spec
; suggests that blank lines ("Enter Enter") at the end of an expression
; would be ignored. But this would mean that in interactive use, the output
; of a first expression would only be produced after the first line of the
; second expression were entered.  This would lead to confusion like this
; (where ">" is an input prompt):
; > + 1 1
; > + 1 2
; 2
; > + 1 3
; 3
; 
; The sample implementation given in SFRI-49 didn't really follow
; the spec of SFRI-49.  For example, it DID accept indentation of the
; first line (though with a problematic semantic), and it DID accept
; blank lines (in some cases) as ending an expression.
; This suggests that the spec is not quite accurate, and needs careful
; revision/clarification.
; 
; The sections below discuss two issues:
; * Leading whitespace at start of expression reading
; * Blank and comment-only lines after initial line of an expression.
; 
; ========================
; ISSUE: Leading whitespace at start of expression reading in I-expressions
; 
; I propose a specific interpretation for leading whitespace in an
; indented I-expression, which I'll call the "most consistent" format.
; Below is an explanation of the problem, and my proposed resolution.
; 
; Thoughts?  After fiddling with the alternatives, I'm getting very worried that
; it'd be easy to type in text that would APPEAR to mean one thing, but would
; ACTUALLY mean something else.  That's definitely something to avoid.
; My "most consistent" proposal completely avoids that, without being quite as
; strict as Python's "thou shalt always start any expression at the left edge".
; 
; First, the initial situation:  The I-expression spec revised 2005/05/29
; does NOT permit an indentation at the beginning of an expression.
; The sample implementation does permit them; it simply skips horizontal
; whitespace on the first line (ignoring them).  The spec's completely
; forbidding them is easily done, but is overly strict; the
; "skip horizontal whitespace" approach has unforunate consequences
; (as discussed further below).
; 
; What SHOULD be done if the start of an expression
; (I'll call that start-expr) begins with whitespace that
; is followed by content (and not just an
; ;-comments, newline (NL) or end-of-file (EOF))? E.G.:
;  start-expr -> hspace+ (not eol...)
; 
; An example should make it clear. Imagine you read this (three lines,
; all indented to the same level at the TOPMOST level):
;    x
;    y
;    z
; 
; One interpretation is that there should be 3 different results: x, y, and z.
; But consider how this would be read.
; You'd read in the indentation before x, and note
; that as the "topmost" indentation.  Then you'd read in the indentation
; before y, notice that it was the same as x's, and stop just before reading
; the "y" and return with just "x".
; But wait - if you did that, when you read "y" you would think that there
; was <i>no</i> indentation (the previous read consumed it), and thus z
; would be further indented... returning (y&nbsp;z).  Ooops, that can't be right.
; 
; Since essentially the dawn of Lisp in the 1950s
; there has been a "read" function that reads an S-expression
; from the input and returns it.
; This is an extremely stable function interface, and one not easily changed
; in fundamental ways.
; In particular, no user of "read" expects it to <i>also</i> return some
; state - such as the indentation that was read the <i>last</i> time read
; was called - and certainly they aren't going to provide that information
; back to "read" anyway.
; Not only is this difficult to change for backwards-compatibility reasons,
; it's not clear you should - simple interfaces are a good idea, if you can
; get them, and adding such "indentation state" as a required parameter would
; certainly complicate the interface.
; 
; In theory, you could "unget" all the indentation characters, so that the
; next read would work correctly.
; But support for this is rare; for example,
; Scheme doesn't even <i>have</i> a standard unget character function, and
; the Common Lisp standard only supports one character unget (not enough!).
; 
; You could store "hidden state" inside the read function.
; Problem is, character-reading is not the exclusive domain of the read function;
; many other functions read characters, and they are unlikely to look at this
; hidden state.
; These functions tend to be low-level functions and in some implementations
; are difficult to override.  So you'd probably have inconsistent values
; from different reading functions, a recipe for subtle bugs.
; What's more, you would have to store hidden state for each possible input
; source, and this can become insane in the many implementations that support
; support ports of non-files (such as from strings).
; "Hidden state" could allow for all this, but the complications of
; <i>implementing</i> hidden state suggests that it'd be better to spec
; something that does <i>not</i> require hidden state.
; 
; 
; 
; 
; Possible solutions:
; 
; 1. Simplest approach: Forbid it.  It's an error if it doesn't start on
; left line.  Python does this.  You could argue that the original spec requires
; this, since there's no production that accepts an initial INDENT.
; The xyz example above would then be illegal.
; 
; But this is not very flexible; #2 (next) appears to be a better option.
; 
; 2. Most consistent: Allow indentation on initial line (and consider that
; the indentation for that expression), as long all later lines have
; a further indentation OR are on the left edge (including a blank line
; ending in EOL or EOF, or a comment the left edge).
; Anything on the left edge ends the expression.
; This at least LETS you indent each expression if you like,
; with NO risk of misinterpretation of later lines.
; The result is that you can indent the first lines of expressions.. you just
; have to separate the different expressions with blank lines.
; To implement this:
; start-expr -> INDENT expr DEDENT
; 
; The xyz example above would be illegal, and thus rejected.
; However, if you inserted blank lines between x, y, and z, you'd be okay.
; 
; This is the most consistent and most flexible, and has no risk of
; misinterpretation, so I propose this one.
; 
; 3. Original implementation ignores hspace:
; start-expr -> hspace+ start-expr
;   $2
; 
; But when this is given the xyz example above, it will misleadingly
; produce (x y z).  That kind of surprise seems undesirable, esp. given
; that there is alternative #2.
; 
; 4. Instead, could disable indent processing on initial hspace, to maximize
; backwards-compatibility and simplify some command line use:
; start-expr -> hspace+ s-expr
;   $2
; 
; This would read in the "xyz" example as you would expect.  It would
; also read in old text like this as it was originally intended:
;   (define x 5) (define y 6)
; 
; However, other formats will be misinterpreted, e.g.,
;   fact
;     5
; will be understood as the two separate expressions (requiring two reads):
;   fact
;   5
; and not as (fact 5).
; 
; This is risky; on printouts, it might not at ALL be obvious when
; expressions are indented like this - resulting in hard-to-debug code
; and hidden defects.
; 
; In general, I think it's much wiser to reject text that might
; be very easily misinterpreted by the reader.  So I suggest #2.
; 
; 
; ========================
; ISSUE: Blank and comment-only lines after initial line of an expression.
; 
;     *** THIS IS UNDER DISCUSSION IN THE MAILING LIST. ***
; 
; Both the original I-expression definition, and this revision,
; have the following rule: After the initial line of an expression,
; any line containing zero or more leading spaces and tabs,
; FOLLOWED by a ";"-leading comment, is COMPLETELY IGNORED, even in the
; middle of an expression.  In particular, its indentation is ignored.
; 
; The proposed change is that lines with 0+ spaces or tabs,
; and no ;-leading comment, end an expression.  Note that a line
; WITH just spaces and tabs is treated the same as a line with no characters.
; 
; This changes is necessary for reasonable interactive use.
; If lines with only zero or more horizontal whitespace were completely
; ignored, as the original spec stated, then interactive use is painful.
; Results would print only after the first line of the NEXT expression
; are entered.  Even the "sample implementation" in the spec didn't
; actually do this.
; 
; To make interactivity pleasant, at least lines with absolutely no
; characters should end an expression after the first line.  That way,
; "Enter Enter" will cause an expression to be executed.
; 
; Then the question becomes, how should a line with 1 or more
; spaces/tabs, and no ;-comments, be interpreted?  And should a line
; with the current indentation be treated differently than if it is not?
; 
; Such lines COULD be interpreted as "continue the indentation"
; if they matched the current indentation... or even if there was
; at least one space/tab.  A minor argument FOR this alternative
; is that it makes "pretty" vertical spacing a possibility.
; 
; But there is a serious problem to treating lines with no characters
; differently from lines with only spaces and tabs.
; The problems is that this could lead to mysterious bugs.
; With such a rule, printed or displayed text could not be understood
; with certainty; a line that looked empty COULD mean either
; "expression completed" OR "expression continues",
; leading to hard-to-debug code.  What's worse, many tools
; quietly remove trailing horizontal whitespace on a line
; (including many text editors and mailers); these deletions would
; generally be unnoticed, yet change the meaning of a program.
; 
; The risk of mysterious, undetectable errors in code is serious,
; and one that leads at least Wheeler to recommend that space/tab-only
; lines (with no comments) be treated exactly like lines with no
; characters at all.  Certainly, it's sometimes valuable to create
; vertical space, but this can be done using comment-only lines
; (which may, but need not, have leading whitespace).
; 
; It is true that Python 2.5 in _interactive_ mode distinguishes
; between lines with no characters (not even whitespace) and lines
; with only whitespace.  In interactive mode, a line with no characters
; ends an expression, while lines with whitespace are considered relevant
; (and can continue further lines).  However, Python 2.5 in
; _file-reading_ mode has different semantics - it ignores both types of
; lines (they have no effect on indentation).  This difference in modes
; has the problem that it can cause cutting-and-pasting from a file to
; an interactive session to fail, which is unfortunate.
; But it's even more difficult for a Lisp-based system; it's often even
; more difficult to be certain when a session is interactive or not -
; there is no standard way for doing so.  This distinction of
; interactive and non-interactive modes is very inconvenient, and
; should be avoided if practical.
; 
; Note that this does NOT change how comment-only lines, preceded by
; only 0+ spaces and tabs, are interpreted - these are STILL completely
; ignored, and any indentation they have is considered irrelevant.
; Thus, people will not need to "line up" indentation
; of comments. This is useful for "FIXME" comments, or for
; long comments to explain a complicated circumstance which is deeply
; indented.  Since this ONLY applies to ;-comment-only lines,
; blank lines (without comments) still end an expression - so
; interactive use is still pleasant.  Most importantly, there's no
; need for a difference between interactive and non-interactive use -
; there's no need for a "mode" flag (which can be hard to get right),
; and you can always cut-and-paste from a file into an interactive session.
; 
; ===================
; Notes about multiline comments
; 
; Note that multiline comments (e.g., #| ... |#) are NOT considered
; comments by these rules. There is simply no way a
; library implementation can reliably detect
; such multicharacter sequences without disabling the reader's
; implementation of # prefixes, because they are limited in many
; languages to single character lookahead.  A #| will be considered
; an s-expr by the indentation processor.  The following uses of #|
; are known to be safe and not misleading:
;   * #| _inside_ an s-expression; in this case indentation processing
;     isn't happening.
;   * #|...|#, where the opening "#|" is the first non-whitespace on the
;     line, nothing trails the line after the closing |#, and
;     the opening #| is indented the same way as the first
;     non-comment-only line following the closing #|.
; 
; ========================
; Possible Test patterns
; 
; Below are some possible test patterns to help eliminate
; errors in an implementation.
; 
; test = (first (second third?)?)?  (SPACE? semicolon - comment)?
; first = abbreviation? t1 (SPACE t2 (SPACE t3)?)?
; t1 = A | GROUP
; t2 = B
; t3 = C
; 
; second = first | SPACE first
; third = SPACE first | SPACE SPACE second

; ;
; ; NOTE: This would be really easy to implement in Scheme, except for one
; ; quirk: most Scheme implementations' "read" function CONSUMES [, ], {, and },
; ; instead of treating them as delimiters like space, (, or ).
; ; This is even true when the Scheme standards don't permit such characters
; ; at all, such as at the end of a number.
; ; The only solution is to re-implement "read" in Scheme, but one that
; ; DOES treat them as delimiters.  So a simple re-implemention is provided.
; ; If your Scheme _does_ treat these characters as delimiters,
; ; you can eliminate all of that re-implementation code, and just use your
; ; built-in "read" function (which probably has additional extensions that
; ; this simple reader does not).
; ;
; ; If you DO use an ordinary Scheme reader, there is a limitation:
; ; the vector notation #(...) could not contain modern notation.
; ; In code, just use vector(...) instead.  The best solution, of course,
; ; is to build this into your Scheme reader.
; ;
; ; You _could_ in a pinch use a standard Scheme reader that didn't
; ; consider {} or [] as delimiters.  But then closing characters } and ]
; ; must be PRECEDED by a delimiter like a space, and you CANNOT invoke
; ; prefixed [] and {} at all.
