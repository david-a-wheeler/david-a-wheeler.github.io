This directory contains code to implement improvements in
the readability of Lisp-like (s-expression-based) programming languages,
including Common Lisp, Scheme (including guile), Emacs Lisp, BitC,
ACL2, AutoCAD Lisp, etc.  There are several different approaches here,
to support different needs and goals.

ALL of the code is released under open source software / Free Software
licenses approved by both the OSI (opensource.org) and FSF (fsf.org).
Most are released under the MIT license, which permits practically any use.

For more information, see:
 http://sourceforge.net/projects/readable/

File suffixes are:
.cl   - Common Lisp
.lisp - Common Lisp
.scm  - Scheme

This directory includes (in alphabetical order):

* curly-infix.cl: A simple reader macro that implements infix operations
in lists surrounded by {...}.  It can optionally be used along with
a separate compile/execution-time macro (such as Gloria's).
By David A. Wheeler. MIT license.

* curly-infix-test: test suite/demo of curly-infix-test.  Requires
Unix-like system and clisp. By David A. Wheeler.  MIT license.

* iformat.cl: A simple pretty-printer that generates I-expressions
(indented S-expressions) given an object. By David A. Wheeler. MIT license.

* infpre.lisp: Common Lisp infix/prefix conversion utility (macro).
By Joern Inge Vestgaarden (jivestgarden at gmail com). License LGPL.
This is a copy from: http://folk.uio.no/jornv/infpre/infpre.lisp

* gloria-infix.lisp: A macro that implements infix notation in Common Lisp.
By Alan Manuel Gloria.  MIT license.

* gloria-infixdemo.lisp: A demo of gloria-infix.lisp.
By Alan Manuel Gloria.

* modern.cl: "Modern Lisp" reader, Common Lisp.

* modern.scm: "Modern Lisp" reader, Scheme.  "modern-scm-test.scm" is
  a guile Scheme program you can run to test it.

* spec-indent.txt: Detailed specification information on I-expressions.

* sugar.scm: an implementation of an I-expression reader, defined in
SFRI-49.  These use indentation to reduce the number of parentheses
needed to represent S-expressions.
By Egil MÃ¶ller (modifications by David A. Wheeler).  MIT license.

* sugar-original.scm: The original sugar.scm as presented in SFRI-49.
This version has a number of bugs in it, but is included separately since
this is the version defined in SFRI-49. MIT license.

* sweet.scm: an implementation of a "sweet-expression" reader, a much
easier-to-read format for S-expressions.  Implemented in the guile
dialect of Scheme.  By David A. Wheeler.  MIT license.
Currently a prototype, and only implements sweet-expressions version 0.1.

* Eventually there will be a small assurance case demo, using ASCAD notation.  
  For more on the ASCAD notation (goal / argument / evidence), see:

Some of this code uses guile's module capability.
To use these in guile, you need to make sure that the %load-path
includes the directory where the source code resides.  For example,
to add searching the current directory "." to the end of the search path:
  (set! %load-path (append %load-path '(".")))
You could include this command in your ~/.guile file, and then it would
be run each time.
Alternatively, you can do this at a shell prompt (or ~/.bashrc or similar):
  export GUILE_LOAD_PATH="."
which will insert the given path(s) at the beginning of %load-path.
Beware: the GUILE_LOAD_PATH has the highest precedence when setting
up the %load-path, so while this is useful for testing,
setting GUILE_LOAD_PATH to include "." can have security problems
if used in "real" programs (an attacker might arrange for a malicious
scheme file to be loaded instead of an intended one).

Once the %load-path is set up, you can easily load modules, e.g.:
  (use-modules (sugar))
