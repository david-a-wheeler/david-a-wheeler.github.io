; iformat.scm  version as of 2008-01-11
; This Scheme program reformats an S-expression into an I-expression.
; An I-expression can represent the same information, but can use indentation
; instead of parentheses.

; To run, just:
;  (load "iformat.scm")
;  (iformat '(your expression) "")

; LIMITATIONS:
; This version changes EVERY list into indentation form, which is overly
; wordy.  A future version should add same-line information, which
; shortens the results dramatically.
;
; A future version should optionally support term-ending like f(x) to mean
; (f x), and {..} for infix operations.  See "sweet-expression" information
; at http://www.dwheeler.com/readable/.
;
; For efficiency, it should use another approach than string concatenation.
; Rewrite this using cons of strings, then flatten the list
; to a single string in a final pass.
