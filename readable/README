This directory contains code to implement improvements in
the readability of s-expression-based programming languages,
including Common Lisp, Scheme (including guile), BitC, Emacs Lisp, etc.

sweet.scm is an implementation of "sweet-expressions" in Scheme (guile's),
released under the MIT license.

./sweet-test  : Run this to run tests.

./sweet-guile : Quick way to start up in sweet-expressions mode.
 : sweet-guile doesn't work any more with the newer versions of guile; TODO.
