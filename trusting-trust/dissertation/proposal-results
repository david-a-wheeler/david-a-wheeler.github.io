  	Thanks for attending my proposal defense! Here are my current plans:
* Drop doing the maliciously misleading source code analysis. The committee decided that it was optional, and Dr. Sandhu suggested it'd be wiser to focus on making the rest high-quality instead of spending time on something optional. I do plan to _discuss_ the issue in the paper, as recommended by the committee - but not delve into analyzing a set of examples as I originally proposed. I can always do a paper doing an analysis of misleading source code another time.
* The term "malicious" has more than one meaning; find a way to tease them apart. I will probably need at least 2 terms, and define them clearly ("corresponding" vs. "non-corresponding", for example, to contrast with "malicious" and "non-malicious"). I haven't settled on the terms yet, suggestions certainly welcome.
* Discuss bytecode (such as used in Java). This may be easiest to do when discussing the LISP example, since LISP is sometimes interpreted, but in any case it'll be somewhere in the dissertation. As a side-effect, I'm thinking about replacing another term. I've consistently used the term "binary" to denote the output of a compiler, and tried to make clear that it's not necessarily the same as the underlying machine code. But perhaps using another term like "object code" instead of "binary" would make that concept easier to understand.

I plan to send status report emails 1-2 times/month from here on. I plan for them to be "event-driven" in many cases (saying when something's been accomplished), rather than solely being date-driven.

=====================

NOTE: Committee agreed that I would (1) create a formal proof, and
(2) demonstrate it on a "real" compiler.
