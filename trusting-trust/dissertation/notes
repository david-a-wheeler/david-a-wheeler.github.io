NOTES on recompiling gcc:

Set up system:
rpm -e ccache
 Disabled caching of compiled results

ran system-config-selinux
 Switched to permissive mode, so any failure to set file values
 wouldn't interfere.

Using tcc to recompile gcc
Decided to use the "main line" of tcc, version 0.9.24:
 http://bellard.org/tcc/
This is led by grischka, who worked to get gcc compiling with tcc.

In the ACSAC paper, tcc had 2 defects that harmed recompilation of tcc:
1. Typecasting bug
   David Heine has posted a patch, which was later included in
   Landley's fork (along with a test case).
  Unclear if this is in tcc 0.9.24, but it may be, e.g.:
   474: Cast ptrs to ints of different sizes correctly (Joshua Phillips)

2. Failure to zero some bits of long double values
   This was fixed by a patch from Felix Nawothnig:
    420: Zero pad x87 tenbyte long doubles (Felix Nawothnig)
   Main branch  0.9.24 and Landley's fork both include this.

(Rob Landley has abandoned his fork.)

Recompiled tcc 0.9.24; unlike older versions of tcc, this one
recompiles itself with the same values, so the bugs I had problems with
are now gone.

grischka noted some timings of recompiling gcc by several C compilers,
and developed patches for tcc so it could recompile gcc.

"bsdiff" is a binary diff program, but it doesn't produce READABLE diff output.
