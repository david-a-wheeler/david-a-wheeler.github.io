David,

I just wanted to write you a quick note to say that I truly enjoyed your dissertation defense this afternoon. I really learned a lot and I thought that you did an excellent job of framing the problem, explaining why it was a problem and demonstrating and proving your solution to the problem. I thought that you did a fine job of anticipating the questions that would be asked and your overall preparedness is something that I hope to incorporate into my dissertation defense someday.

Thanks,
