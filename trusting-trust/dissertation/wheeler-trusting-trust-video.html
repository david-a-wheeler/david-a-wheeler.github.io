<p>
Here is a video of my PhD public defense, November 23, 2009, 1-3pm.
It is not a professional recording, but it&#8217;s the real thing.
This public defense is an overview of my PhD dissertation,
justifying this thesis:
<blockquote>
&#8220;The trusting trust attack can be detected and
effectively countered using the &#8216;Diverse Double-Compiling&#8217; (DDC)
technique, as demonstrated by:
<ol>
<li>a formal proof that DDC can determine if source
code and generated executable code correspond
<li>a demonstration of DDC with four compilers
(a small C compiler, a small Lisp compiler, a small
maliciously corrupted Lisp compiler, and a large
industrial-strength C compiler, GCC), and
<li>a description of approaches for applying DDC in
various real-world scenarios.&#8221;
</ol>

recent hosting service didn't like hosting big files.)

<i>Your browser does not support the HTML5 video tag or the webm format.  Please upgrade. For more information, see <a href="http://www.webmproject.org/users/#supported_web_browsers">how to play webm videos</a>.  One solution would be to use Firefox or Chrome, which have built-in support for webm videos.  Internet Explorer 9 also works, just you download the no-cost webm drivers.  You might also try YouTube or downloading the file, as described below.
<br><br>
If you are using an iPad, the problem may be a known bug in some iPads: At least some iPads require MP4 to be listed first.  But I have no interest in listing MP4 first; the MP4 size is much larger than the webm (straining my system), and MP4 is a patent-encumbered format.  Please tell Apple to fix this bug, and use a standards-compliant product in the meantime.

The presentation material is separately available in

A few notes about the presention that day.
The disembodied voice at the beginning of the video is
Dr. Ravi Sandhu, one of my advisors,
who simply asked me to repeat audience questions.
On slide #23 the audio is hard to follow for a moment; there I warn
that the details of section 5 (the formal mathematical proof)
can be a little &#8220;forbidding&#8221;.
<p>
The 2009 dissertation itself is also available;
you can see
<a href="wheeler-trusting-trust-ddc.pdf">Fully Countering Trusting Trust through Diverse Double-Compiling in the PDF format</a>, as well as in
<a href="html/wheeler-trusting-trust-ddc.html">HTML</a> or
<a href="dissertation/wheeler-trusting-trust-ddc.odt">OpenDocument</a> formats.
If you read the dissertation you should also read the
<a href="../dissertation-errata.html"><b>dissertation errata</b></a>
(which correct minor typos and such).
<p>
At the end of the public presentation
I was asked when I went to GMU, and I made some unintentional mistakes
in my answer.
Basically, I incorrectly remembered ending years as
starting years (for example, I first started at GMU in 1983, not 1987).
Sorry about that.
The correct answer is that
my PhD took more than 14 years (from my start in the fall of 1995
through its award in January 2010), and
my first appearance at GMU through completion of my PhD took more than 26
years (from the start of my BS degree in the fall of 1983 through
January 2010).
