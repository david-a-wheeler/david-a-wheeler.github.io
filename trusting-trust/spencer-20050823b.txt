No, it would have been thought of strictly for compiler debugging.  (Which
was also the purpose I originally knew it for -- the security application
hadn't occurred to me, I believe, until that mailing-list discussion.)

Aha, it was Peter Neumann's "Robust Open Source" list.  And I saved a copy
of my message -- see attached.  (Interestingly enough, it lacks the typo!)

If you're a member of that list, you might want to ask Peter for a copy of
the archive (as far as I know, there's never been an openly-accessible
archive of that list); there probably was related discussion.
