David,

The more or less complete archives are actually accessible on my 
website, but not directly linked to my main webpage.  Try
  http://www.csl.sri.com/neumann/open.txt
, which contain 2233 messages at the moment!

Posting to it is restricted to subscribers, but subscription
is open to folks with a genuine interest -- to keep out spam
primarily and hostile contributors.

You could say

  Henry Spencer, ..., posted on the Robust Open Source mailing list
  (open-source@CSL.sri.com) established by Peter G. Neumann
  (neumann@sri.com).  

Then let's see who wants to subscribe!  If they are smart enough
to try to use mailman, it should require my approval anyway.

Thanks for checking.  Peter
