This directory contains the original files by Goerigk, and the
modified files I created from them.

The file "demo-output" has the raw output.
Run "demo" to do the demo, which in turn runs demo-shell.cl.
Requires the "clisp" implementation of Common Lisp.

"compiler.lisp" and "machine.lisp" converted from ACL2 to straight
Common Lisp, so that any Common Lisp implementation can handle it directly
(no need to depend on ACL2).  This just required:
* removing the "defthm" (define theorem) statements,
* removing the mutual-recursion declarations
  (ACL2 requires that mutually-recursive functions be declared
  as such, something not required by Common Lisp).
* Renaming "execute" to "execute-am" (CLISP has "execute" predefined).
* Defined a few functions in ACL2, but not in CL.


 clisp -v -on-error debug demo-shell.cl
(type ":bt" for backtrace)
