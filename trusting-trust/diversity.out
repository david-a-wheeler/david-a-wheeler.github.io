### Creating chain of tiny C compilers. First, bootstrap tcc.


#### Copying tcc-0.9.22 into tcc-0.9.20-chain-bootstrap
### Now patching for 8-bit casting problem, 0.0 difference
### PATCH!
### gcc 3.4.3 won't compile tcc-0.9.20 directly, because
### gcc's checking is more stringent now. In tcc-0.9.20,
### functions are defined like this:
###  void *__bound_ptr_add(void *p, int offset) __attribute__((regparm(2)));
### but in others the  __attribute__((regparm(2)) is omitted.
### gcc now perceives that as inconsistent.
### We can pretend we're part of the bootstrap compiler (a preprocessor)
### and just throw away the regparm() stuff; it's just an optimization.
