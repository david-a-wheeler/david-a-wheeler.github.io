I poked around a bit in my files and found one or two related tidbits. 
Notably, the problem you saw with non-deterministic output (the don't-care
bytes in the floating-point constant) can occur for other reasons:  one of
the Java compilers dumps its constant pool out in hash-table order, and
its hash function apparently uses object addresses as part of the hash, so
the output order is exquisitely sensitive to the slightest changes in
compile environment.
