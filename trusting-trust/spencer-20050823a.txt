Neat!  On a quick skim, looks very nicely done -- I'll have a closer look
tonight.

The assorted virtues of a self-compiling compiler have been vaguely part
of the folklore for a long time, but I may have been the first to notice
this particular technique... although I thought of it (long before that
posting) in the context of compiler debugging rather than Trojan-horse
finding. 

The one specific source that I *might* have picked it up from, without
remembering, is the old XPL book ("A Compiler Generator"; McKeeman,
Horning, and Wortman; 1970).  XPL, which was a PL/I dialect used for
compiler writing, was self-compiling.  Its compiler was bootstrapped into
existence with a really elaborate series of self-compilation and
non-self-compilation steps -- the process was so complex that a diagram of
it filled one of the endpapers of the book!  They may, just possibly, have
used the idea.  I don't have the book on hand to check.  (Hmm, I'll ask
Wortman -- he was my MSc supervisor.)

Point of curiosity:  where *was* that posting?  I have only the vaguest
recollection of the discussion, and don't remember where it took place.

> If you have any comments, let me know by the end of August...

Well, I *would* like to ask that you edit out that unfortunate typo in my
posting! 

That aside, the only thing I noticed on my quick skim is that the Sabin
reference is out of sequence in the references list.  Possibly more
comments tonight.
