So many people have reviewed my paper
"Countering Trusting Trust through Diverse Double-Compiling" that
it's hard to keep track.  Here are the ones I can remember - thank you!

Reg Meeson -- Many conversations about the technique, some paper comments
Dale Lichtblau -- Strongly recommended I start small (thanks!),
     his skepticism that it would work at all forced me to significantly
     improve the description of it, such as the M68K example (thanks).

Clyde Roby
Aaron Hatcher -- in particular, for noticing a "self-gen" statement
     that should have said "stage 1" (wrong and confusing, not what was meant)
Tawnia Wheeler -- edit check
Clyde Moseberry (in particular, for re-discussing notation)
