I checked with Dave Wortman.  Yes, they routinely used such a technique
when developing and extending XPL -- compile new source with old compiler,
compile new source with resulting new compiler, compare binaries to see if
there was any difference (or, if code generation was changing, if there
were any differences other than the expected ones) -- and it is indeed
written up in the book.  So I almost certainly got the basic idea from
them, and you should probably mention that.

However, they definitely thought of the technique only in terms of
debugging.  I think I still have a clean claim to being the first to
notice the security application. 

Incidentally, Dave tells me that XPL still (!) sees a small amount of use,
and it has a web site:  <http://www.cs.toronto.edu/XPL/>.
