David,
The Transactions is more prestigious in the academic world, the magazine is more prestigious in the practitioner's world.   I can see why your adviser would want to publish in Transactions; is there anyway to break up the current paper so that you get one pub for each?  S&P has a much shorter word count than Transactions, so it would not allow you to elucidate your ideas and proofs in any detail.  Maybe start with a publication in detail in Transactions, followed up with a practitioners paper for S&P?  Can he give you an idea of the delay for Transactions, S&P is currently running about 17 months (unless you luck out and get a special issue that they would put your paper into).  S&P has a much bigger readership, but if you want to go into academia someday the Transactions pub would be much more advantageous.  

I'd try to cut the paper into two versions (detailed and overview) and put a version into each.

Hope this helps.
