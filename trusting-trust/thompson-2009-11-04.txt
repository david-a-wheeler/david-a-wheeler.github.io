david,

good to hear from you. i have, of coarse, read your DDC paper.
from a theoretical point of view, i think it is very nice,
but from a practical point, i think the cure is at least as
bad as the disease. here are some of my arguments.

1. there are very few people in a position to widely install
and distribute a 'trust' bug. i think the threat is close to
zero. certainly the threat is much smaller than the distribution
of binary-only code that is so prevalent on the net today. how
do you know that one of the norton updates, microsoft patches,
flash or adobe downloads doesnt contain malicious code?
routinely you get megabytes of code off the net and then
type your system password to install it. if i were a bad guy,
i would take the path of least resistance and buy off someone
at adobe.

2. there are a lot more targets than just the C compiler and
there are a lot more disease vectors than the C compiler.
there is SH, C++, CPP, LD, LIBC, AS, AR, LINUX, JAVA, PYTHON,
etc, etc, etc. each of these would have to be generated from
scratch with a separate trusted vector. each one would be more
difficult than your TCC example, while all of them would
be close to impossible. i dont know how to even find all the
potential targets.

3. operationally, it will be hard to keep the trusted vectors
all up to date. a lot of the targets are moving targets
that are distributed from one source. getting and maintaining
a trusted version will be hard. keeping everything working
will be super-human.

again, i really enjoyed your paper. thanks for thinking of me.
