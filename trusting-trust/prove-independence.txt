Assumptions are Independent in 'Fully Countering Trusting Trust through Diverse Double-Compiling'.

In my dissertation [Wheeler 2009] I provided three proofs, and showed that the
assumptions of each of the proofs were consistent.
This paper extends the dissertation, by showing that
each of the assumptions in each proof
are independent of the other assumptions.

Given some set of consistent assumptions Q, and another assumption P,
then P is independent of Q if both Q&cup;P and Q&cup;&not;P yield consistent assumptions, 
This is noted, for example, in [Kunen 1980, page xi].
Hesseling explains that Heyting [Heyting 1930] uses this approach to prove the independence of his
formalization of intuitionist logic, and credits Bernays with the technique in which
"what we would nowadays call models in which each time ten of the eleven
given axioms are true, the eleventh one false... [by] varying the
eleventh axiom and presenting a different model to which the new
combination of axioms applies, he proves that all the axioms are independent
of each other." [Hesseling, page 278].
