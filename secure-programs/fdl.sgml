	  The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other
	  written document "free" in the sense of freedom: to assure everyone
	  the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it, with or without
	  modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially. Secondarily,
	  this License preserves for the author and publisher a way to get
	  credit for their work, while not being considered responsible for
	  modifications made by others.
	</para>
	
	<para>
	  This License is a kind of "copyleft", which means that derivative
	  works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense. It
	  complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft
	  license designed for free software.
	</para>
	
	<para>
	  We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free
	  software, because free software needs free documentation: a free
	  program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the
	  software does. But this License is not limited to software manuals; it
	  can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or
	  whether it is published as a printed book. We recommend this License
	  principally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference.

	  The <ulink type="http" url="http://www.gnu.org/fsf/fsf.html">Free
	  Software Foundation</ulink> may publish new, revised versions of the
	  GNU Free Documentation License from time to time. Such new versions
	  will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in
	  detail to address new problems or concerns. See <ulink type="http"

	  Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version
	  number. If the <link linkend="fdl-document">Document</link> specifies
	  that a particular numbered version of this License "or any later
	  version" applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and
	  conditions either of that specified version or of any later version
	  that has been published (not as a draft) by the Free Software
	  Foundation. If the <link linkend="fdl-document">Document</link> does
	  not specify a version number of this License, you may choose any
	  version ever published (not as a draft) by the Free Software
	  Foundation.
