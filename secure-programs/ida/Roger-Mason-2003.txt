Subject: [ISN] Linux Advisory Watch - August 15th 2003


For many, it has been an eventful week.  Blaster has affected nearly =
every
windows server on the net.  Although I'm sure many Linux administrators
smirked while saying "not my servers," an equal number had "to deal with
it."  Whether you maintain Windows boxes or not, there are several =
lessons
to be learned.  First, as most readers of this newsletter are already
aware, patching is critical.  Also, incident preparation is extremely
important.  It is important to develop a weekly schedule where time can =
be
allocated for regular server maintenance.  Also, a documented set of
incident procedures should be written.  It is important to have =
emergency
contacts and system procedures documented before an incident so that
damage can be minimized.

Last week I reviewed the O'Reilly book, Secure Coding: Principles &
Practices.  I received several emails about the book including one from
David Wheeler, author of the "Secure Programming for Linux and Unix
HOWTO."  Because I've found this document helpful in the past, I thought
that I should share it with you.  The latest PDF version of the document
is 168 pages, written in twelve chapters.  It is distributed under the =
GNU
Free Documentation License, therefore copying and distributing is
perfectly legal.  In the past, I've sent previous versions of this
document to friends who are full time software developers.  Everyone =
that
has read this document has been impressed.

The HOWTO includes chapters on input validation, avoiding buffer
overflows, using system resources, as well as special topics that =
include
passwords, random numbers, cryptography, and authentication.  The book
also includes a chapter with specific information for popular languages
such as C/C++, PERL, python, shell, Ada, Java, Tcl, and PHP.

This HOWTO is worth the bandwidth!  Download it!  It is a great addition
to last week's book because it focuses on many specific issues.  If you
have a problem related to secure program to solve, this is definitely =
one
of the first places you should check.
