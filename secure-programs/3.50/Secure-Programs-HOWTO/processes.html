>3.1. Processes</H1
><P
>In Unix-like systems,
user-level activities are implemented by running processes.
Most Unix systems support a ``thread'' as a separate concept;
threads share memory inside a process, and the system scheduler actually
schedules threads.
Linux does this differently (and in my opinion uses a better approach):
there is no essential difference between a thread and a process.
Instead, in Linux, when a process creates another process it can choose
what resources are shared (e.g., memory can be shared).
The Linux kernel then performs optimizations to get thread-level speeds;
see clone(2) for more information.
It's worth noting that the Linux kernel developers tend to use the
word ``task'', not ``thread'' or ``process'', but the external
documentation tends to use the word process
(so I'll use the term ``process'' here).
When programming a multi-threaded application,
it's usually better to use one of the standard
thread libraries that hide these differences.
Not only does this make threading more portable, but some libraries
provide an additional level of indirection, by implementing more than
one application-level thread as a single operating system thread;
this can provide some improved performance on some systems for
some applications.</P

>3.1.1. Process Attributes</H2
><P
>Here are typical attributes associated with each process in a
Unix-like system:

<P
></P
><UL
><LI
><P
>RUID, RGID - real UID and GID
of the user on whose behalf the process is running</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>EUID, EGID - effective UID and GID
used for privilege checks (except for the filesystem)</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>SUID, SGID - Saved UID and GID;
used to support switching permissions ``on and off'' as discussed below.
Not all Unix-like systems support this, but the vast majority do
(including Linux and Solaris);
if you want to check if a given system implements this option in the
POSIX standard, you can use sysconf(2) to determine if
_POSIX_SAVED_IDS is in effect.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>supplemental groups - a list of groups (GIDs) in which this
user has membership.
In the original version 7 Unix, this didn't exist -
processes were only a member of one group at a time, and a special
command had to be executed to change that group.
BSD added support for a list of groups in each process,
which is more flexible, and
this addition is now widely implemented (including by Linux and Solaris).</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>umask - a set of bits determining the default access control settings
when a new filesystem object is created; see umask(2).</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>scheduling parameters - each process has a scheduling policy, and those
with the default policy SCHED_OTHER have the additional parameters
nice, priority, and counter.  See sched_setscheduler(2) for more information.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>limits - per-process resource limits (see below).</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>filesystem root - the process' idea of where the root filesystem
("/") begins; see chroot(2).</P
></LI
></UL
>&#13;</P
><P
>Here are less-common attributes associated with processes:

<P
></P
><UL
><LI
><P
>FSUID, FSGID - UID and GID used for filesystem access checks;
this is usually equal to the EUID and EGID respectively.
This is a Linux-unique attribute.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>capabilities - POSIX capability information; there are actually three
sets of capabilities on a process: the effective, inheritable, and permitted
capabilities.  See below for more information on POSIX capabilities.
Linux kernel version 2.2 and greater support this; some other Unix-like
systems do too, but it's not as widespread.</P
></LI
></UL
>&#13;</P
><P
>In Linux,
if you really need to know exactly what attributes are associated
with each process, the most definitive source is the
Linux source code, in particular
<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/usr/include/linux/sched.h</TT
>'s definition of task_struct.</P
><P
>The portable way to create new processes it use the fork(2) call.
BSD introduced a variant called vfork(2) as an optimization technique.
The bottom line with vfork(2) is simple: <EM
>don't</EM
> use it if you
can avoid it.
See <A
HREF="avoid-vfork.html"
>Section 8.6</A
> for more information.</P
><P
>Linux supports the Linux-unique clone(2) call.
This call works like fork(2), but allows specification of which resources
should be shared (e.g., memory, file descriptors, etc.).
Various BSD systems implement an rfork() system call
(originally developed in Plan9); it has different
semantics but the same general idea (it also creates a process with tighter
control over what is shared).
Portable programs shouldn't use these calls directly, if possible;
as noted earlier,
they should instead rely on threading libraries that use such
calls to implement threads.</P
><P
>This book is not a full tutorial on writing programs, so
I will skip widely-available information handling processes.
You can see the documentation for wait(2), exit(2), and so on for more
information.</P

NAME="POSIX-CAPABILITIES"

>3.1.2. POSIX Capabilities</H2
><P
>POSIX capabilities are sets of bits that permit splitting of the privileges
typically held by root into a larger set of more specific privileges.
POSIX capabilities are defined
by a draft IEEE standard; they're not unique to Linux but they're not
universally supported by other Unix-like systems either.
Linux kernel 2.0 did not support POSIX capabilities, while version 2.2
added support for POSIX capabilities to processes.
When Linux documentation (including this one)
says ``requires root privilege'', in nearly all cases it
really means ``requires a capability'' as documented in the capability
documentation.
If you need to know the specific capability required, look it up in the
capability documentation.</P
><P
>In Linux,
the eventual intent is to permit capabilities to be attached to files
in the filesystem; as of this writing, however, this is not yet supported.
There is support for transferring capabilities, but this is disabled
by default.
Linux version 2.2.11 added a feature that makes capabilities
more directly useful, called the ``capability bounding set''.
The capability bounding set is a list of capabilities
that are allowed to be held by any process on the system (otherwise,
only the special init process can hold it).
If a capability does not appear in the bounding set, it may not be
exercised by any process, no matter how privileged. 
This feature can be used to, for example, disable kernel module loading.
A sample tool that takes advantage of this is LCAP at

>3.1.3. Process Creation and Manipulation</H2
><P
>Processes may be created using fork(2), the non-recommended vfork(2),
or the Linux-unique clone(2); all of these system calls duplicate the existing
process, creating two processes out of it.
A process can execute a different program by calling execve(2),
or various front-ends to it (for example, see exec(3), system(3), and popen(3)).</P
><P
>When a program is executed, and its file has its setuid or setgid bit set,
the process' EUID or EGID (respectively) is usually set to the file's value.
This functionality was the source of an old Unix security weakness
when used to support setuid or setgid scripts, due to a race condition.
Between the time the kernel opens the file to see which interpreter to run,
and when the (now-set-id) interpreter turns around and reopens
the file to interpret it, an attacker might change the file
(directly or via symbolic links).</P
><P
>Different Unix-like systems handle the security issue for setuid scripts
in different ways.
Some systems, such as Linux, completely ignore the setuid and setgid
bits when executing scripts, which is clearly a safe approach.
Most modern releases of SysVr4 and BSD 4.4 use a different approach to
avoid the kernel race condition.
On these systems, when the kernel passes
the name of the set-id script to open to the interpreter,
rather than using a pathname (which would permit the race condition)
it instead passes the filename /dev/fd/3.  This is a special
file already opened on the script, so that there can be no
race condition for attackers to exploit.
Even on these systems I recommend against using the setuid/setgid
shell scripts language for secure programs, as discussed below.</P
><P
>In some cases a process can affect the various UID and GID values; see
setuid(2), seteuid(2), setreuid(2), and the Linux-unique setfsuid(2).
In particular the saved user id (SUID) attribute
is there to permit trusted programs to temporarily switch UIDs.
Unix-like systems supporting the SUID use the following rules:
If the RUID is changed, or the EUID is set to a value not equal to the RUID,
the SUID is set to the new EUID.
Unprivileged users can set their EUID from their SUID,
the RUID to the EUID, and the EUID to the RUID.</P
><P
>The Linux-unique
FSUID process attribute is intended to permit programs like the NFS server
to limit themselves to only the filesystem rights of some given UID
without giving that UID permission to send signals to the process.
Whenever the EUID is changed, the FSUID is changed to the new
EUID value; the FSUID value can be set separately using setfsuid(2), a
Linux-unique call.
Note that non-root callers can only set FSUID to the current
RUID, EUID, SEUID, or current FSUID values.</P
