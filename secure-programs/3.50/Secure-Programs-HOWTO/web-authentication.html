>11.2. Authenticating on the Web</H1
><P
>On the web, a web server is usually authenticated to users by using SSL or TLS
and a server certificate - but it's not as easy to authenticate who
the users are.
SSL and TLS do support client-side certificates, but there are many practical
problems with actually using them (e.g., web browsers don't support a single
user certificate format and users find it difficult to install them).
You can learn about how to set up digital certificates from many places, e.g.,
<A
HREF="http://www.petbrain.com/modules.php?op=modload&name=pki&file=index"
TARGET="_top"
>Petbrain</A
>.
Using Java or Javascript has its own problems, since many users disable them,
some firewalls filter them out, and they tend to be slow.
In most cases, requiring every user to install a plug-in is impractical too,
though if the system is only for an intranet for a relatively
small number of users this may be appropriate.</P
><P
>If you're building an intranet application, you should generally use
whatever authentication system is used by your users.
Unix-like systems tend to use Kerberos, NIS+, or LDAP.
You may also need to deal with a Windows-based authentication schemes
(which can be viewed as proprietary variants of Kerberos and LDAP).
Thus, if your organization depend on Kerberos,
design your system to use Kerberos.
Try to separate the authentication system from the rest of your application,
since the organization may (will!) change their authentication system over
time.

>
discusses some approaches for implementing single sign-on (SSO) for
intranets.</P
><P
>Many techniques for authentication
don't work or don't work very well for Internet applications.
One approach that works in some cases
is to use ``basic authentication'', which is built into
essentially all browsers and servers.
Unfortunately, basic authentication sends passwords unencrypted, so it
makes passwords easy to steal; basic authentication by itself is really
useful only for worthless information.
You could store authentication information in the URLs selected by the users,
but for most circumstances you should never do this - not only are
the URLs sent unprotected over the wire (as with basic authentication),
but there are too many other ways that
this information can leak to others
(e.g., through the browser history logs stored by many browsers,
logs of proxies, and to other web sites through the Referer: field).
You could wrap all communication with a web server using
an SSL/TLS connection (which would encrypt it); this is secure
(depending on how you do it), and it's
necessary if you have important data, but note that
this is costly in terms of performance.
You could also use ``digest authentication'', which exposes the communication
but at least authenticates the user without exposing the
underlying password used to authenticate the user.
Digest authentication is intended to be a simple partial solution for
low-value communications,
but digest authentication
is not widely supported in an interoperable way by web browsers and servers.
In fact, as noted in a March 18, 2002 eWeek article,
Microsoft's web client (Internet Explorer) and web server (IIS)
incorrectly implement the standard  (RFC 2617), and thus won't work with
other servers or browsers. Since Microsoft
don't view this incorrect implementation as a serious
problem, it will be a very long time before most of their customers have
a correctly-working program.</P
><P
>Thus, the most common technique for storing authentication
information on the web today is through cookies.
Cookies weren't really designed for this purpose, but they can be used
to support authentication - but there are many wrong ways to use them that
create security vulnerabilities, so be careful.
For more information about cookies, see IETF RFC 2965, along with the
older specifications about them.
Note that to use cookies, some browsers (e.g., Microsoft
Internet Explorer 6) may insist that you
have a privacy profile (named p3p.xml on the root directory of the server).</P
><P
>Note that some users don't accept cookies, so this solution still has
some problems.
If you want to support these users,
you should send this authentication information back and forth via
HTML form hidden fields
(since nearly all browsers support them without concern).
You'd use the same approach as with cookies - you'd just use a different
technology to have the data sent from the user to the server.
Naturally, if you implement this approach, you need to include settings to
ensure that these pages aren't cached for use by others.
However, while I think avoiding cookies
is preferable, in practice these other approaches often require
much more development effort.
Since it's so hard to implement this on a large scale for many
application developers, I'm not currently stressing these approaches.
I would rather describe an approach that is reasonably secure and
reasonably easy to implement, than emphasize approaches that are too
hard to implement correctly (by either developers or users).
However, if you can do so without much effort, by all means support
sending the authentication information using form hidden fields and
an encrypted link (e.g., SSL/TLS).
As with all cookies, for these cookies you
should turn on the HttpOnly flag unless
you have a web browser script that must be able to read the cookie.</P
><P
>Fu [2001] discusses client authentication on the web, along with a
suggested approach, and this is the approach I suggest for most sites.
The basic idea is that client authentication is split into two parts,
a ``login procedure'' and ``subsequent requests.''
In the login procedure, the server asks for the user's username and password,
the user provides them, and the server replies with an
``authentication token''.
In the subsequent requests, the client (web browser)
sends the authentication token
to the server (along with its request); the server verifies that the 
token is valid, and if it is, services the request.
Another good source of information about web authentication is
Seifried [2001].</P
><P
>One serious problem with some web authentication techniques is that
they are vulnerable to a problem called "session fixation".
In a session fixation attack, the attacker fixes the user's session ID
before the user even logs into the target server, thus eliminating the
need to obtain the user's session ID afterwards.
Basically, the attacker obtains an account, and then tricks another
user into using the attacker's account - often by creating a special
hypertext link and tricking the user into clicking on it.
A good paper describing session fixation is the paper by
<A
HREF="http://www.acros.si/papers/session_fixation.pdf"

>Mitja Kolsek [2002]</A
>.
A web authentication system you use should be resistant to session fixation.</P

>11.2.1. Authenticating on the Web: Logging In</H2
><P
>The login procedure is typically implemented as an HTML form;
I suggest using the field names ``username'' and ``password'' so that
web browsers can automatically perform some useful actions.
Make sure that the password is sent over an encrypted connection
(using SSL or TLS, through an https: connection) - otherwise, eavesdroppers
could collect the password.
Make sure all password text fields are marked as passwords in the HTML,
so that the password text is not visible to
anyone who can see the user's screen.</P
><P
>If both the username and password fields are filled in,
do not try to automatically log in as that user.
Instead, display the login form with the user and password fields;
this lets the user verify that they really want to log in as that user.
If you fail to do this, attackers will be able to exploit this weakness to
perform a session fixation attack.
Paranoid systems might want simply ignore the password field and make the
user fill it in, but this interferes with browsers which can store
passwords for users.</P
><P
>When the user sends username and password, it must be checked against
the user account database.
This database shouldn't store the passwords ``in the clear'', since if
someone got a copy of the this database they'd suddenly get everyone's
password (and users often reuse passwords).
Some use crypt() to handle this, but crypt can only handle a small
input, so I recommend using a different approach (this is my approach -
Fu [2001] doesn't discuss this).
Instead, the user database should store a username, salt, and 
the password hash for that user.
The ``salt'' is just a random sequence of characters, used to make it
harder for attackers to determine a password even if they get the
password database - I suggest an 8-character random sequence.
It doesn't need to be cryptographically random, just different from
other users.
The password hash should be computed by concatenating
``server key1'', the user's password, and the salt, and
then running a cryptographically secure hash algorithm.
Server key1 is a secret key unique to this server - keep it separate
from the password database.
Someone who has server key1 could then run programs to crack user
passwords if they also had the password database;
since it doesn't need to be memorized, it can be a long and complex
password.
Most secure would be HMAC-SHA-1 or HMAC-MD5;
you could use SHA-1 (most web sites aren't really worried about
the attacks it allows) or MD5 (but MD5 would be poorer choice;
see the discussion about MD5).</P
><P
>Thus, when users create their accounts, the password is hashed and
placed in the password database.
When users try to log in, the purported password is hashed and compared
against the hash in the database (they must be equal).
When users change their password, they should type in both the old
and new password, and the new password twice (to make sure they didn't
mistype it); and again, make sure none of these password's characters
are visible on the screen.</P
><P
>By default, don't save the passwords themselves on the client's
web browser using cookies - users may sometimes use shared clients
(say at some coffee shop).
If you want, you can give users the option of ``saving the password''
on their browser, but if you do, make sure that the password is set to
only be transmitted on ``secure'' connections, and make sure the user has
to specifically request it (don't do this by default).</P
><P
>Make sure that the page is marked to not be cached, or a proxy
server might re-serve that page to other users.</P
><P
>Once a user successfully logs in, the server needs to send the client
an ``authentication token'' in a cookie, which is described next.</P

>11.2.2. Authenticating on the Web: Subsequent Actions</H2
><P
>Once a user logs in, the server sends back to the client a cookie
with an authentication token that will be used from then on.
A separate authentication token is used, so that users don't need to keep
logging in, so that passwords aren't continually sent back and forth, and
so that unencrypted communication can be used if desired.
A suggested token (ignoring session fixation attacks) would look like this:
<TABLE
BORDER="0"
BGCOLOR="#E0E0E0"
WIDTH="100%"
><TR
><TD
><FONT
COLOR="#000000"
><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>  exp=t&#38;data=s&#38;digest=m</PRE
></FONT
></TD
></TR
></TABLE
>
Where t is the expiration time of the token (say, in several hours),
and data s identifies the user (say, the user name or session id).
The digest is a keyed digest of the other fields.
Feel free to change the field name of ``data'' to be more descriptive
(e.g., username and/or sessionid).
If you have more than one field of data (e.g., both a username and a
sessionid), make sure the digest uses both the field names and data values
of all fields you're authenticating; concatenate them with a pattern
(say ``%%'', ``+'', or ``&#38;'')
that can't occur in any of the field data values.
As described in a moment, it would be a good idea to include a username.
The keyed digest should be a cryptographic hash of the other information in
the token, keyed using a different server key2.
The keyed digest should use HMAC-MD5 or HMAC-SHA1, using a different server
key (key2), though simply using SHA1 might be okay for some purposes
(or even MD5, if the risks are low).
Key2 is subject to brute force guessing attacks, so it should be
long (say 12+ characters) and unguessable; it does NOT need to be easily
remembered.
If this key2 is compromised, anyone can authenticate to the server, but
it's easy to change key2 - when you do, it'll simply force currently
``logged in'' users to re-authenticate.
See Fu [2001] for more details.</P
><P
>There is a potential weakness in this approach.
I have concerns that Fu's approach, as originally described, is weak against
session fixation attacks (from several different directions, which
I don't want to get into here).
Thus, I now suggest modifying Fu's approach and using this token format
instead:
<TABLE
BORDER="0"
BGCOLOR="#E0E0E0"
WIDTH="100%"
><TR
><TD
><FONT
COLOR="#000000"
><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>  exp=t&#38;data=s&#38;client=c&#38;digest=m</PRE
></FONT
></TD
></TR
></TABLE
>
This is the same as the original Fu aproach, and older versions of
this book (before December 2002) didn't suggest it.
This modification adds a new
"client" field to uniquely identify the client's current location/identity.
The data in the client field should be something that should change
if someone else tries to use the account; ideally, its new value should be
unguessable, though that's hard to accomplish in practice.
Ideally the client field would be the client's SSL client certificate,
but currently that's a suggest that is hard to meet.
At the least, it should be the user's IP address (as perceived from
the server, and remember to plan for IPv6's longer addresses).
This modification doesn't completely counter session fixation attacks,
unfortunately (since if an attacker can determine what the user
would send, the attacker may be able to make a request to a server
and convince the client to accept those values).
However, it does add resistance to the attack.
Again, the digest must now include all the other data.</P
><P
>Here's an example.
If a user logs into foobar.com sucessfully, you might establish
the expiration date as 2002-12-30T1800 (let's assume we'll transmit as
ASCII text in this format for the moment), the username as "fred",
the client session as "1234", and you might determine that the
client's IP address was 5.6.7.8.
If you use a simple SHA-1 keyed digest
(and use a key prefixing the rest of the data), with the server key2 value of
"rM!V^m~v*Dzx", the digest could be computed over:
<TABLE
BORDER="0"
BGCOLOR="#E0E0E0"
WIDTH="100%"
><TR
><TD
><FONT
COLOR="#000000"
><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"

></FONT
></TD
></TR
></TABLE
>
A keyed digest can be computed by running a cryptographic hash code
over, say, the server key2, then the data;
in this case, the digest would be:
<TABLE

></FONT
></TD
></TR
></TABLE
></P
><P
>From then on, the server must check the expiration time and recompute the
digest of this authentication token, and only accept client requests
if the digest is correct.
If there's no token, the server should reply with the user login page
(with a hidden form field to show where the successful login should go
afterwards).</P
><P
>It would be prudent to display the username, especially on important
screens, to help counter session fixation attacks.
If users are given feedback on their username, they may notice if they
don't have their expected username.  This is helpful anyway if it's
possible to have an unexpected username (e.g., a family that shares the
same machine).
Examples of important screens include those when a file is uploaded
that should be kept private.</P
><P
>One odd implementation issue: although the specifications for the
"Expires:" (expiration time) field for cookies
permit time zones, it turns out that some versions of
Microsoft's Internet Explorer don't implement time zones correctly
for cookie expiration.
Thus, you need to always use UTC time (also called Zulu time)
in cookie expiration times for maximum portability.
It's a good idea in general to use UTC time for time values,
and convert when necessary for human display, since this eliminates other
time zone and daylight savings time issues.</P
><P
>If you include a sessionid in the authentication token, you can limit
access further.
Your server could ``track'' what pages a user has seen in a given session,
and only permit access to other appropriate pages from that point
(e.g., only those directly linked from those page(s)).
For example,
if a user is granted access to page foo.html, and page foo.html has
pointers to resources bar1.jpg and bar2.png, then accesses to bar4.cgi
can be rejected.
You could even kill the session, though only do this if the authentication
information is valid (otherwise, this would make it possible for
attackers to cause denial-of-service attacks on other users).
This would somewhat limit the access an attacker has, even if they
successfully hijack a session, though clearly an attacker with time
and an authentication token
could ``walk'' the links just as a normal user would.</P
><P
>One decision is whether or not to require the authentication token and/or
data to be sent over a secure connection (e.g., SSL).
If you send an authentication token
in the clear (non-secure), someone who intercepts the
token could do whatever the user could do until the expiration time.
Also, when you send data over an unencrypted link, there's the risk of
unnoticed change by an attacker; if you're worried that someone might change the
data on the way, then you need to authenticate the data being transmitted.
Encryption by itself doesn't guarantee authentication, but it does make
corruption more likely to be detected, and typical libraries can support
both encryption and authentication in a TLS/SSL connection.
In general, if you're encrypting a message, you should also authenticate it.
If your needs vary,
one alternative is to create two authentication tokens - one is used
only in a ``secure'' connection for important operations, while the other
used for less-critical operations.
Make sure the token used for ``secure'' connections is marked so that only
secure connections (typically encrypted SSL/TLS connections) are used.
If users aren't really different, the authentication token could omit
the ``data'' entirely.</P
><P
>Again, make sure that the pages with this authentication token aren't cached.
There are other reasonable schemes also; the goal of this text is
to provide at least one secure solution.
Many variations are possible.</P
