><P
>A secure program should always ``fail safe'', that is,
it should be designed so that if the program does fail, the safest
result should occur.
For security-critical programs, that usually means that
if some sort of misbehavior is detected (malformed input,
reaching a ``can't get here'' state, and so on), then the program
should immediately deny service and stop processing that request.
Don't try to ``figure out what the user wanted'': just deny the service.
Sometimes this can decrease reliability or useability
(from a user's perspective), but it increases security.
There are a few cases where this might not be desired (e.g., where denial of
service is much worse than loss of confidentiality or integrity), but
such cases are quite rare.</P
><P
>Note that I recommend ``stop processing the request'', not ``fail altogether''.
In particular, most servers should not completely halt when given malformed
input, because that creates a trivial opportunity for a denial of service
attack (the attacker just sends garbage bits to prevent you from using the
service).
Sometimes taking the whole server down is necessary, in particular,
reaching some ``can't get here'' states may signal a problem so drastic
that continuing is unwise.</P
><P
>Consider carefully what error message you send back when a failure is detected.
if you send nothing
back, it may be hard to diagnose problems, but sending back too much
information may unintentionally aid an attacker.
Usually the best approach is to reply with ``access denied'' or
``miscellaneous error encountered'' and then
write more detailed information to an audit log (where you can have more
control over who sees the information).</P
