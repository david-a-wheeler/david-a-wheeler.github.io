>The first two points primarily protect me from repeatedly hearing about
obsolete bugs.
I do not want to hear about bugs I fixed a year ago, just because you
are not properly mirroring the document.
By linking to the master site,
users can check and see if your mirror is up-to-date.
I'm sensitive to the problems of sites which have very
strong security requirements and therefore cannot risk normal
connections to the Internet; if that describes your situation,
at least try to meet the other points
and try to occasionally sneakernet updates into your environment.</P

>By this license, you may modify the document,
but you can't claim that what you didn't write is yours (i.e., plagiarism)
nor can you pretend that a modified version is identical to
the original work.
Modifying the work does not transfer copyright of the entire work to you;
this is not a ``public domain'' work in terms of copyright law.
See the license in <A
HREF="fdl.html"
>Appendix D</A
> for details.
If you have questions about what the license allows, please contact me.
In most cases, it's better if you send your changes to the master
integrator (currently David A. Wheeler), so that your changes will be
integrated with everyone else's changes into the master copy.</P

>I am not a lawyer, nevertheless, it's my position as an author
and software developer that any code fragments
not explicitly marked otherwise are so small that their use fits under
the ``fair use'' doctrine in copyright law.
In other words, unless marked otherwise, you can use the code fragments
without any restriction at all.
Copyright law does not permit copyrighting absurdly small components
of a work
(e.g., ``I own all rights to B-flat and B-flat minor chords''), and
the fragments not marked otherwise are of the same kind of minuscule
size when compared to real programs.
I've done my best to give credit for specific pieces of code
written by others.
Some of you may still be concerned about the legal status of this code,
and I want make sure that it's clear
that you can use this code in your software.
Therefore, code fragments included directly in this document not otherwise
marked have also been released by me under the terms of the ``MIT license'',
to ensure you that there's no serious legal encumbrance:</P
