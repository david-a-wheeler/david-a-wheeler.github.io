>7.19. Avoid Algorithmic Complexity Attacks</H1
><P
>If it's important that your system keep working
(and not be vulnerable to denial-of-service attacks), then it needs
to be designed so it's not vulnerable to
"Algorithmic Complexity Attacks".
These attacks exploit the difference between 'typical case' behavior
versus worst-case behavior; they intentionally send data that
causes an algorithm to consistently display worst-case behavior.
For examples, hash tables usually have O(1) performance for all operations,
but in many implementations an attacker can
construct input so a large number of 'hash collisions' occur.
Other common algorithms that can be attacked include sorting
routines (e.g., quicksort's worst case is O(n^2) instead of O(n log n))
and regular expression implementations.
Many higher-level capabilities are built on these basic algorithms
(e.g., many searches use hash tables).
More information about this attack is available in
Crosby and Wallach's paper on the subject [Crosby 2003].</P

>There are several solutions.
One approach is to choose
algorithms with the best "worst-case" behavior, not just the
best "average-case" behavior;
many "real-time" algorithms are specially designed to have the best
"worst-case" behavior, so search for those versions.
Crosby and Wallach propose a "universal hashing library" hash function
that avoids this problem.
Although I've seen no proof that they'd work, trivially keyed
hashes (where what is to be hashed is first passed
through a random local key) should be effective, and cryptographically
keyed hashes should be very effective - just make sure the attacker
can't determine the key.
Judy trees may be an effective alternative to b-trees.</P
