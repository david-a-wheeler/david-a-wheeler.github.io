	  the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it, with or without

	  this License preserves for the author and publisher a way to get
	  credit for their work, while not being considered responsible for

	  complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft

	</P
><P
>	  We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free
	  software, because free software needs free documentation: a free

> to the <A
HREF="fdl.html#FDL-DOCUMENT"
> Document's</A

>Document</A
> is in part a textbook of
	  mathematics, a <A
HREF="fdl.html#FDL-SECONDARY"
>Secondary Section</A
