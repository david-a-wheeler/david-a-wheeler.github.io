secure programs (or, alternatively, how to find security problems in
existing programs), and were the basis for the guidelines highlighted

recommends the use of access(3) without noting the dangerous race conditions

>There are many documents specific to a language, which are further
discussed in the language-specific sections of this book.
For example, the Perl distribution includes
<A
HREF="http://www.perl.com/pub/doc/manual/html/pod/perlsec.html"
TARGET="_top"
>perlsec(1)</A
>, which describes how to use Perl more securely.
The Secure Internet Programming site at
<A
HREF="http://www.cs.princeton.edu/sip"
TARGET="_top"
>http://www.cs.princeton.edu/sip</A
>
is interested in computer security issues in general, but focuses on
mobile code systems such as Java, ActiveX, and JavaScript; Ed Felten
(one of its principles) co-wrote a book on securing Java
(<A
HREF="http://www.securingjava.com"
TARGET="_top"
>[McGraw 1999]</A
>)
which is discussed in <A
HREF="java.html"
>Section 10.6</A
>.
Sun's security code guidelines provide some guidelines primarily
for Java and C; it is available at
<A
HREF="http://java.sun.com/security/seccodeguide.html"
TARGET="_top"
>http://java.sun.com/security/seccodeguide.html</A
>.</P
><P
>Yoder [1998] contains a collection of patterns to be used
when dealing with application security.
It's not really a specific set of guidelines, but a set of commonly-used
patterns for programming that you may find useful.
The Schmoo group maintains a web page linking to information on
how to write secure code at
<A
HREF="http://www.shmoo.com/securecode"
TARGET="_top"
>http://www.shmoo.com/securecode</A
>.</P
><P
>There are many documents describing the issue from
the other direction (i.e., ``how to crack a system'').
One example is McClure [1999], and there's countless amounts of material
from that vantage point on the Internet.
There are also more general documents on computer architectures on how
attacks must be developed to exploit them, e.g.,
[LSD 2001].
The Honeynet Project has been collecting information
(including statistics) on how attackers
actually perform their attacks; see their website at
<A
HREF="http://project.honeynet.org"
TARGET="_top"
>http://project.honeynet.org</A
>
for more information.</P
><P
>There's also a large body of information on vulnerabilities
already identified in existing programs.
This can be a useful set of
examples of ``what not to do,'' though it takes effort to extract more
general guidelines from the large body of specific examples.
There are mailing lists that discuss security issues; one of the most
well-known is
<A
HREF="http://SecurityFocus.com/forums/bugtraq/faq.html"
TARGET="_top"
>Bugtraq</A
>, which among other things develops a list of vulnerabilities.
The CERT Coordination Center (CERT/CC)
is a major reporting center for Internet security problems which
reports on vulnerabilities.
The CERT/CC occasionally produces advisories that
provide a description of a serious security problem
and its impact, along with
instructions on how to obtain a patch or details of a workaround; for
more information see
<A
HREF="http://www.cert.org"
TARGET="_top"
>http://www.cert.org</A
>.
Note that originally the CERT was
a small computer emergency response team, but officially
``CERT'' doesn't stand for anything now.
The Department of Energy's
<A
HREF="http://ciac.llnl.gov/ciac"
TARGET="_top"
>Computer
Incident Advisory Capability (CIAC)</A
> also reports on vulnerabilities.
These different groups may identify the same vulnerabilities but use different
names.
To resolve this problem,
MITRE supports the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) list
which creates a single unique identifier (``name'')
for all publicly known vulnerabilities and security exposures
identified by others; see
<A
HREF="http://www.cve.mitre.org"
TARGET="_top"
>http://www.cve.mitre.org</A
>.
NIST's ICAT
is a searchable catalog of computer vulnerabilities, categorizing
each CVE vulnerability so that they can be searched
and compared later; see
<A
HREF="http://csrc.nist.gov/icat"
TARGET="_top"
>http://csrc.nist.gov/icat</A
>.</P

>This book is a summary of what I believe are the most
useful and important guidelines.
My goal is a book that
a good programmer can just read and then be fairly well prepared
to implement a secure program.
No single document can really meet this goal, but
I believe the attempt is worthwhile.
My objective is to strike a balance somewhere between a
``complete list of all possible guidelines''
(that would be unending and unreadable)
and the various ``short'' lists available on-line that are nice and short
but omit a large number of critical issues.
When in doubt, I include the guidance; I believe in that case it's better
to make the information
available to everyone in this ``one stop shop'' document.
The organization presented here is my own (every list has its own, different
structure), and some of the guidelines (especially the Linux-unique
ones, such as those on capabilities and the FSUID value) are also my own.
Reading all of the referenced documents listed above as well
is highly recommended, though I realize that for many it's impractical.</P
