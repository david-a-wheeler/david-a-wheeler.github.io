>7.13. Set up a Trusted Path</H1
><P
>The counterpart to needing trustworthy channels
(see <A
HREF="trustworthy-channels.html"
>Section 7.12</A
>)
is assuring users that they
really are working with the program or system they intended to use.</P
><P
>The traditional example is a ``fake login'' program.
If a program is written to look like the login screen of a system, then
it can be left running.
When users try to log in, the fake login program can then capture user
passwords for later use.</P
><P
>A solution to this problem is a ``trusted path.''
A trusted path is simply some mechanism that provides confidence that the
user is communicating with what the user intended to communicate with,
ensuring that attackers can't intercept or modify whatever information
is being communicated.</P
><P
>If you're asking for a password, try to set up trusted path.
Unfortunately, stock Linux distributions and many other Unixes don't
have a trusted path even for their normal login sequence.
One approach is to 
require pressing an unforgeable key before login, e.g.,
Windows NT/2000 uses ``control-alt-delete'' before logging in; since
normal programs in Windows can't intercept this key pattern, this
approach creates a trusted path.
There's a Linux equivalent, termed the
<A
HREF="http://lwn.net/2001/0322/a/SAK.php3"
TARGET="_top"
>Secure Attention Key
(SAK)</A
>; it's recommended that this be mapped to
``control-alt-pause''.
Unfortunately, at the time of this writing SAK is immature and not
well-supported by Linux distributions.
Another approach for implementing a trusted path
locally is to control a separate display that only the login
program can perform.
For example, if only trusted programs could modify the keyboard lights
(the LEDs showing Num Lock, Caps Lock, and Scroll Lock),
then a login program could display a running pattern to indicate that
it's the real login program.
Unfortunately, since in current Linux normal users can change the LEDs,
the LEDs can't currently be used to confirm a trusted path.</P
><P
>Sadly, the problem is much worse for network applications.
Although setting up a trusted path is desirable for network applications,
completely doing so is quite difficult.
When sending a password over a network, at the very least
encrypt the password between trusted endpoints.
This will at least prevent eavesdropping of passwords by those not
connected to the system, and at least make attacks harder to perform.
If you're concerned about trusted path for the actual communication, make
sure that the communication is
encrypted and authenticated (or at least authenticated).</P
><P
>It turns out that this isn't enough to have a trusted path
to networked applications, in particular for web-based applications.
There are documented methods for fooling users of web browsers into thinking
that they're at one place when they are really at another.
For example, Felten [1997] discusses ``web spoofing'',
where users believe they're viewing one web page when in fact all the
web pages they view go through an attacker's site (who can then monitor
all traffic and modify any data sent in either direction).
This is accomplished by rewriting the URL.
The rewritten URLs can be made nearly invisible
by using other technology (such as Javascript) to hide any possible
evidence in the status line, location line, and so on.
See their paper for more details.
Another technique for hiding such URLs is exploiting rarely-used URL
syntax, for example, the URL
``http://www.ibm.com/stuff@mysite.com''
is actually a request to view ``mysite.com'' (a potentially malevolent site)
using the unusual username ``www.ibm.com/stuff'.
If the URL is long enough,
the real material won't be displayed and users are unlikely to
notice the exploit anyway.
Yet another approach is to create sites with names deliberately similar
to the ``real'' site - users may not know the difference.
In all of these cases, simply encrypting the line doesn't help -
the attacker can be quite content in encrypting data while completely
controlling what's shown.</P
><P
>Countering these problems is more difficult;
at this time I have no good technical solution for fully preventing
``fooled'' web users.
I would encourage web browser developers to counter such ``fooling'',
making it easier to spot.
If it's critical that your users correctly connect to the correct site,
have them use simple procedures to counter the threat.
Examples include having them halt and restart their browser, and making sure
that the web address is very simple and not normally misspelled
(so misspelling it is unlikely).
You might also want to gain ownership of some ``similar'' sounding DNS names,
and search for other such DNS names and material to find attackers.

Microsoft's Internet Explorer won't allow the "@" symbol at all in URLs</A

this is an unfortunate restriction, but probably good for security.
Another less draconian solution would have been to put up a warning
dialogue, clearly displaying the real site name and user name.</P
