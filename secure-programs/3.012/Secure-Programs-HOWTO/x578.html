>4.1. Common Criteria Introduction</A
></H1
><P
>First, some general information about the CC will help understand
how to apply its concepts.
The CC's official name is
"The Common Criteria for Information Technology Security Evaluation",
though it's normally just called the Common Criteria.
The CC document has three parts:
the introduction (that describes the CC overall),
security functional requirements (that lists various kinds of security
functions that products might want to include),
and security assurance requirements (that lists various methods of
assuring that a product is secure).
There is also a related document, the
"Common Evaluation Methodology" (CEM),
that guides evaluators how to apply the CC when doing formal evaluations
(in particular, it amplifies what the CC means in certain cases).</P
><P
>Although the CC is International Standard ISO/IEC 15408:1999,
it is outrageously expensive to order the CC from ISO.
Hopefully someday ISO will follow the lead of other standards
organizations such as the IETF and the W3C, which freely redistribute
standards.
Not surprisingly, IETF and W3C standards are followed more often than
many ISO standards, in part because ISO's fees for standards simply
make them inaccessible to most developers.
(I don't mind authors being paid for their work, but ISO doesn't
fund most of the standards development work - indeed, many of the developers
of ISO documents are volunteers - so ISO's indefensible fees only line their
own pockets and don't actually aid the authors or users at all.)
Thankfully, the CC developers anticipated this problem and have made sure
that the CC's technical content is freely available to all;
you can download the CC's technical content from

>http://csrc.nist.gov/cc/ccv20/ccv2list.htm</A
>
Even those doing formal evaluation processes usually
use these editions of the CC, and not the ISO versions;
there's simply no good reason to pay ISO for them.</P
><P
>Although it can be used in other ways, the CC is typically
used to create two kinds of documents, a
``Protection Profile'' (PP) or a ``Security Target'' (ST).
A ``protection profile'' (PP) is a document created by group of users
(for example, a consumer group or large organization)
that identifies the desired security properties of a product.
Basically, a PP is a list of user security requirements,
described in a very specific way defined by the CC.
If you're building a product similar to other existing products, it's
quite possible that there are one or more PPs that define what some
users believe are necessary for that kind of product
(e.g., an operating system or firewall).
A ``security target'' (ST) is a document that identifies what a product
actually does, or a subset of it, that is security-relevant.
An ST doesn't need to meet the requirements of
any particular PP, but an ST could meet the requirements of one or more PPs.</P
><P
>Both PPs and STs can go through a formal evaluation.
An evaluation of a PP simply ensures that the PP meets various documentation
rules and sanity checks.
An ST evaluation involves not just examining the ST document,
but more importantly it involves evaluating an actual system
(called the ``target of evaluation'', or TOE).
The purpose of an ST evaluation is to ensure that, to the level of
the assurance requirements specified by the ST,
the actual product (the TOE) meets the ST's security functional requirements.
Customers can then compare evaluated STs to
PPs describing what they want.
Through this comparison, consumers can determine if the
products meet their requirements - and if not, where the limitations are.</P
><P
>To create a PP or ST, you go through a process of identifying the
security environment, namely, your
assumptions, threats, and relevant organizational
security policies (if any).
From the security environment, you derive
the security objectives for the product or product type.
Finally, the security requirements are selected so that
they meet the objectives.
There are two kinds of security requirements: functional requirements
(what a product has to be able to do), and assurance requirements
(measures to inspire confidence that the objectives have been met).
Actually creating a PP or ST is often not a simple straight line as
outlined here, but the final result needs to show a clear relationship so
that no critical point is easily overlooked.
Even if you don't plan to write an ST or PP,
the ideas in the CC can still be helpful;
the process of identifying the security environment, objectives, and
requirements is still helpful in identifying what's really important.</P
><P
>The vast majority of the CC's text is used to define standardized
functional requirements and assurance requirements.
In essence, the majority of the CC is a ``chinese menu'' of possible
security requirements that someone might want.
PP authors pick from the various options to describe what they want, and
ST authors pick from the options to describe what they provide.</P
><P
>Since many people might have difficulty identifying a reasonable set
of assurance requirements, so pre-created sets of assurance requirements
called ``evaluation assurance levels'' (EALs) have been defined, ranging
from 1 to 7.
EAL 2 is simply a standard shorthand for the set of assurance requirements
defined for EAL 2.
Products can add additional assurance measures, for example, they might
choose EAL 2 plus some additional assurance measures (if the combination
isn't enough to achieve a higher EAL level, such a combination would be
called "EAL 2 plus").
There are mutual recognition agreements signed between many of the
world's nations that will accept an evaluation done by
an accredited laboratory in the other countries as long as all of the
assurance measures taken were at the EAL 4 level or less.</P
><P
>If you want to actually write an ST or PP, there's an
open source software program that can help you, called the
``CC Toolbox''.
It can make sure that dependencies between requirements
are met, suggest common requirements, and help you quickly
develop a document, but it obviously can't do your thinking for you.
The specification of exactly what information
must be in a PP or ST are in CC part 1, annexes B and C respectively.</P
><P
>If you do decide to have your product (or PP) evaluated by
an accredited laboratory, be prepared to spend money, spend time,
and work throughout the process.
In particular, evaluations require paying an
accredited lab to do the evaluation, and higher levels of assurance
become rapidly more expensive.
Simply believing your product is secure isn't good enough; evaluators
will require evidence to justify any claims made.
Thus, evaluations require documentation, and usually the available
documentation has to be improved or developed
to meet CC requirements (especially at the higher assurance levels).
Every claim has to be justified to some level of confidence, so the more
claims made, the stronger the claims, and the
more complicated the design, the more expensive an evaluation is.
Obviously, when flaws are found, they will usually need to be fixed.
Note that a laboratory is paid to evaluate a product and determine the truth.
If the product doesn't meet its claims, then you basically have two
choices: fix the product, or change (reduce) the claims.</P
><P
>It's important to discuss with customers what's desired before beginning
a formal ST evaluation;
an ST that includes functional or assurance requirements
not truly needed by customers will
be unnecessarily expensive to evaluate, and an ST that omits
necessary requirements may not be acceptable to the customers
(because that necessary piece won't have been evaluated).
PPs identify such requirements, but make sure that the PP
accurately reflects the customer's real requirements (perhaps the customer
only wants a part of the functionality or assurance in the PP,
or has a different environment in mind, or wants something else instead
for the situations where your product will be used).
Note that an ST need not include every security feature in a product;
an ST only states what will be (or has been) evaluated.
A product that has a higher EAL rating is not necessarily more secure than a
similar product with a lower rating or no rating;
the environment might be different, the evaluation may have saved money and
time by not evaluating the other product at a higher level,
or perhaps the evaluation missed something important.
Evaluations are not proofs; they simply impose a defined minimum bar to
gain confidence in the requirements or product.</P
