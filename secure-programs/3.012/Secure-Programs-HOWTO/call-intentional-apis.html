>8.4. Call Only Interfaces Intended for Programmers</A
></H1
><P
>Call only application programming interfaces (APIs) that are
intended for use by programs.
Usually a program can invoke any other program,
including those that are really designed for human interaction.
However, it's usually unwise to invoke a program intended for human
interaction in the same way a human would.
The problem is that programs's human interfaces are intentionally rich
in functionality and are often difficult to completely control.
As discussed in <A
HREF="handle-metacharacters.html"
>Section 8.3</A
>,
interactive programs often have ``escape'' codes,
which might enable an attacker to perform undesirable functions.
Also, interactive programs often try to intuit the ``most likely'' defaults;
this may not be the default you were expecting, and an attacker may find
a way to exploit this.</P
><P
>Examples of programs you shouldn't normally call directly include
mail, mailx, ed, vi, and emacs.
At the very least, don't call these without checking
their input first.</P
><P
>Usually there are parameters to give you safer access to the program's
functionality,
or a different API or application that's intended for use by programs;
use those instead.
For example, instead of invoking a text editor to edit some text
(such as ed, vi, or emacs), use sed where you can.</P
