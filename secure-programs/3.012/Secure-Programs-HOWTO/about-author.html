>David A. Wheeler is an expert in computer security and
has long specialized in development techniques for large and
high-risk software systems.
He has been involved in software development
since the mid-1970s,
and been involved with Unix and computer security since the early 1980s.
His areas of knowledge include computer security,
software safety, vulnerability analysis, inspections, Internet technologies,
software-related standards (including POSIX),
real-time software development techniques,
and numerous computer languages
(including Ada, C, C++, Perl, Python, and Java).</P
><P
>Mr. Wheeler is co-author and lead editor of the IEEE book
<EM
>Software Inspection: An Industry Best Practice</EM
>,
author of the book
<EM
>Ada95: The Lovelace Tutorial</EM
>,
and co-author of the
<EM
>GNOME User's Guide</EM
>.
He is also the author of many smaller papers and articles, including the
Linux <EM
>Program Library HOWTO</EM
>.</P
