buffer overflow problems.
The first subsection describes the ``standard C library'' solution, which
can work but has its disadvantages.
The next subsection describes the general security issues of both
fixed length and dynamically reallocated approaches to buffers.
The following subsections describe various alternative libraries,
such as strlcpy and libmib.

extremely carefully in C/C++ to avoid all buffer overflow situations.</P

>6.2.1. Standard C Library Solution</A
></H2
><P
>The ``standard'' solution to prevent buffer overflow in C
(which is also used in some C++ programs)
is to use the standard C library calls that defend against these problems.
This approach depends heavily on the standard library functions
strncpy(3) and strncat(3).
If you choose this approach, beware: these calls have somewhat surprising
semantics and are hard to use correctly.
The function strncpy(3) does not NIL-terminate the destination string
if the source string length is at least equal to the destination's, so
be sure to set the last character of the destination string to NIL after
calling strncpy(3).
If you're going to reuse the same buffer many times,
an efficient approach is to tell strncpy() that the buffer is one
character shorter than it actually is and set the last character to
NIL once before use.
Both strncpy(3) and strncat(3) require that you pass
the amount of space left available, a computation
that is easy to get wrong (and getting it wrong could permit a
buffer overflow attack).
Neither provide a simple mechanism to determine if an overflow has occurred.
Finally, strncpy(3) has a significant performance penalty compared
to the strcpy(3) it supposedly replaces,
because <EM
>strncpy(3) NIL-fills the remainder of the destination</EM
>.
I've gotten emails expressing surprise over this last point, but this is
clearly stated in Kernighan and Ritchie second edition
[Kernighan 1988, page 249], and this behavior is clearly documented in
the man pages for Linux, FreeBSD, and Solaris.
This means that just changing from strcpy to strncpy can cause a severe
reduction in performance, for no good reason in most cases.</P
><P
>Warning!!
The function strncpy(s1, s2, n) can also be used as
a way of copying only part of s2, where n is less than strlen(s2).
When used this way, strncpy() basically provides no protection against
buffer overflow by itself - you have to take
separate actions to ensure that n is smaller than the buffer of s1.
Also, when used this way, strncpy() does not usually add a trailing NIL
after copying n characters.
This makes it harder to determine if a program using strncpy() is secure.</P
><P
>You can also use sprintf() while preventing
buffer overflows, but you need to be careful when doing so;
it's so easy to misapply that it's hard to recommend.
The sprintf control string can contain various conversion specifiers
(e.g., "%s"), and the control specifiers can have optional
field width (e.g., "%10s") and precision (e.g., "%.10s") specifications.
These look quite similar (the only difference is a period)
but they are very different.
The field width only
specifies a <EM
>minimum</EM
> length and is
completely worthless for preventing buffer overflows.
In contrast, the precision specification specifies the maximum
length that that particular string may have in its output when
used as a string conversion specifier - and thus it can be used
to protect against buffer overflows.
Note that the precision specification only specifies the total maximum
length when dealing with a string; it has a different meaning for
other conversion operations.
If the size is given as a precision of "*", then you can pass the maximum size
as a parameter (e.g., the result of a sizeof() operation).
This is most easily shown by an example - here's the wrong and right
way to use sprintf() to protect against buffer overflows:
<TABLE

CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
> char buf[BUFFER_SIZE];
 sprintf(buf, "%*s",  sizeof(buf)-1, "long-string");  /* WRONG */
 sprintf(buf, "%.*s", sizeof(buf)-1, "long-string");  /* RIGHT */</PRE
></FONT
></TD
></TR
></TABLE
>
In theory, sprintf() should be very helpful because you can use it
to specify complex formats.
Sadly, it's easy to get things wrong with sprintf().
If the format is complex, you
need to make sure that the destination is large enough for the largest
possible size of the <EM
>entire</EM
>
format, but the precision field only controls
the size of one parameter.
The "largest possible" value is often hard to determine when a
complicated output is being created.
If a program doesn't allocate quite enough space for the longest possible
combination, a buffer overflow vulnerability may open up.
Also, sprintf() appends a NUL to the destination
after the entire operation is complete -
this extra character is easy to forget and creates an opportunity
for off-by-one errors.
So, while this works, it can be painful to use in some circumstances.</P
><P
>Also, a quick note about the code above - note that the sizeof()
operation used the size of an array.
If the code were changed so that ``buf'' was a pointer to some
allocated memory, then all ``sizeof()'' operations would have to be
changed (or sizeof would just measure the size of a pointer, which isn't
enough space for most values).</P
><P
>The scanf() family is sadly a little murky as well.
An obvious question is whether or not the maximum width value can
be used in %s to prevent these attacks.
There are multiple official specifications for scanf();
some clearly state that the width parameter is the absolutely largest
number of characters, while others aren't as clear.
The biggest problem is implementations; modern implementations
that I know of do support maximum widths, but I cannot say with
certainty that all libraries properly implement maximum widths.
The safest approach is to do things yourself in such cases.
However, few will fault you if you simply use scanf and include the
widths in the format strings
(but don't forget to count \0, or you'll get the wrong length).
If you do use scanf, it's best to include a test in your installation
scripts to ensure that the library properly limits length.&#13;</P

NAME="STATIC-VS-DYNAMIC-BUFFERS"
>6.2.2. Static and Dynamically Allocated Buffers</A
></H2
><P
>Functions such as strncpy
are useful for dealing with statically allocated buffers.
This is a programming approach where a buffer is allocated for
the ``longest useful size'' and then it stays a fixed size from then on.
The alternative is to dynamically reallocate buffer sizes as you need them.
It turns out that both approaches have security implications.</P
><P
>There is a general security problem when using fixed-length buffers: the fact
that the buffer is a fixed length may be exploitable.
This is a problem with strncpy(3) and strncat(3), snprintf(3),
strlcpy(3), strlcat(3), and other such functions.
The basic idea is that the attacker sets up a really long string so that,
when the string is truncated, the final result will be what the
attacker wanted (instead of what the developer intended).
Perhaps the string is catenated from several smaller
pieces; the attacker might make the first piece as long as the entire
buffer, so all later attempts to concatenate strings do nothing.
Here are some specific examples:

<P
></P
><UL
><LI
><P
>Imagine code that calls gethostbyname(3) and, if
successful, immediately copies hostent-&#62;h_name to a
fixed-size buffer using strncpy or snprintf.
Using strncpy or snprintf protects against an overflow of an excessively
long fully-qualified domain name (FQDN), so you might think you're done.
However, this could result in chopping off the end of the FQDN.
This may be very undesirable, depending on what happens next.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>Imagine code that uses strncpy, strncat, snprintf, etc., to copy the
full path of a filesystem object to some buffer.
Further imagine that the original value was provided by an
untrusted user, and that the copying is part of a process to pass a
resulting computation to a function.
Sounds safe, right?
Now imagine that an attacker pads a path
with a large number of '/'s at the beginning.  This could
result in future operations being performed on the file ``/''.
If the program appends values in the belief that the result will be safe,
the program may be exploitable.
Or, the attacker could devise a long filename near the buffer length, so that
attempts to append to the filename would silently fail to occur
(or only partially occur in ways that may be exploitable).</P
></LI
></UL
>&#13;</P
><P
>When using statically-allocated buffers,
you really need to consider the length of the source and destination arguments.
Sanity checking the input and the resulting intermediate computation might
deal with this, too.</P
><P
>Another alternative is to dynamically reallocate all strings instead of using
fixed-size buffers.
This general approach is recommended by the GNU programming guidelines,
since it permits programs to handle arbitrarily-sized inputs
(until they run out of memory).
Of course, the major problem with dynamically allocated strings is that you
may run out of memory.  The memory may even be exhausted at some other
point in the program than the portion where you're worried about buffer
overflows; any memory allocation can fail.
Also, since dynamic reallocation may cause memory to be inefficiently
allocated, it is entirely possible to run out of memory even though
technically there is enough virtual memory available to the program
to continue.
In addition, before running out of memory the program will probably
use a great deal of virtual memory; this can easily result in
``thrashing'', a situation in which the computer spends all its time
just shuttling information between the disk and memory (instead of
doing useful work).
This can have the effect of a denial of service attack.
Some rational limits on input size can help here.
In general, the program must be designed to
fail safely when memory is exhausted if you use dynamically allocated strings.</P

NAME="STRLCPY"
>6.2.3. strlcpy and strlcat</A
></H2
><P
>An alternative, being employed by OpenBSD, is the
strlcpy(3) and strlcat(3) functions by Miller and de Raadt [Miller 1999].
This is a minimalist, statically-sized buffer approach that provides C string
copying and concatenation with a different (and less error-prone) interface.
Source and documentation of these functions
are available under a newer BSD-style open source license at
<A
HREF="ftp://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/src/lib/libc/string/strlcpy.3"
TARGET="_top"
>ftp://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/src/lib/libc/string/strlcpy.3</A
>.</P
><P
>First, here are their prototypes:

size_t strlcat (char *dst, const char *src, size_t size);</PRE
></FONT
></TD
></TR
></TABLE
>

Both strlcpy and strlcat
take the full size of the destination buffer as a parameter
(not the maximum number of characters to be copied) and guarantee to
NIL-terminate the result (as long as size is larger than 0).
Remember that you should include a byte for NIL in the size.</P
><P
>The strlcpy function copies up to
size-1 characters from the NUL-terminated string src to dst,
NIL-terminating the result.
The strlcat
function appends the NIL-terminated string
src to the end of dst.
It will append at most 
size - strlen(dst) - 1 bytes, NIL-terminating the result.</P
><P
>One minor disadvantage of strlcpy(3) and strlcat(3) is that they are
not, by default, installed in most Unix-like systems.
In OpenBSD, they are part of &#60;string.h&#62;.
This is not that difficult a problem; since they are small functions, you can
even include them in your own program's source (at least as an option),
and create a small separate package to load them.
You can even use autoconf to handle this case automatically.
If more programs use these functions, it won't be long before these are
standard parts of Linux distributions and other Unix-like systems.
Also, these functions have
been recently added to the ``glib'' library (I submitted the patch
to do this), so using recent versions of glib makes them available.
In glib these functions are named g_strlcpy and g_strlcat
(not strlcpy or strlcat) to be consistent with the glib library
naming conventions.</P
><P
>Also, strlcat(3) has slightly varying semantics
when the provided size is 0 or if there are no NIL characters in
the destination string dst (inside the given number of characters).
In OpenBSD, if the size is 0, then the destination string's length is
considered 0.
Also, if size is nonzero, but there are no NIL characters
in the destination string (in the size number of characters), then
the length of the destination is considered equal to the size.
These rules make handling strings without embedded NILs consistent.
Unfortunately, at least Solaris doesn't (at this time) obey these rules,
because they weren't specified in the original documentation.
I've talked to Todd Miller, and he and I agree that the OpenBSD
semantics are the correct ones (and that Solaris is incorrect).
The reasoning is simple: under no condition should strlcat or strlcpy
ever examine characters in the destination outside of the range of size;
such access might cause core dumps (from accessing out-of-range memory)
and even hardware interactions (through memory-mapped I/O).
Thus, given:
<TABLE

BGCOLOR="#E0E0E0"

COLOR="#000000"
><PRE
CLASS="SCREEN"
>  a = strlcat ("Y", "123", 0);</PRE
></FONT
></TD
></TR
></TABLE
>
The correct answer is 3 (0+3=3), but Solaris will claim the answer is 4
because it incorrectly looks at characters beyond the "size" length in
the destination.
For now, I suggest avoiding cases where the size is 0 or the destination
has no NIL characters.
Future versions of glib will hide this difference and always use the OpenBSD
semantics.</P

This is a dynamic approach, as the storage grows as necessary.
However, it's important to note that if that class's data is turned
into a ``char *'' (e.g., by using data() or c_str()),
the possibilities of buffer overflow resurface, so you need to be careful
when when using such methods.
Note that c_str() always returns a NIL-terminated string, but
data() may or may not (it's implementation dependent, and most
implementations do not include the NIL terminator).
Avoid using data(), and if you must use it, don't be dependent on its format.</P

>Many C++ developers use other string libraries as well, such as
those that come with other large libraries or even home-grown string libraries.
With those libraries, be especially careful - many
alternative C++ string classes
include routines to automatically convert the class to a ``char *'' type.

></H2
><P
>Arash Baratloo, Timothy Tsai, and Navjot Singh
(of Lucent Technologies)
have developed Libsafe, a wrapper of several library functions known to be
vulnerable to stack smashing attacks.
This wrapper (which they call a kind of ``middleware'')
is a simple dynamically loaded library that contains modified versions
of C library functions such as strcpy(3).
These modified versions
implement the original functionality, but in a manner that ensures
that any buffer overflows are contained within the current stack frame.
Their initial performance analysis suggests that this
library's overhead is very small.
Libsafe papers and source code are available at
<A
HREF="http://www.research.avayalabs.com/project/libsafe"
TARGET="_top"
>http://www.research.avayalabs.com/project/libsafe</A
>.
The Libsafe source code is available under the completely
open source LGPL license.</P
><P
>Libsafe's approach appears somewhat useful.
Libsafe should certainly be considered for inclusion by Linux
distributors, and its approach is worth considering by others as well.
For example, I know that the Mandrake distribution of Linux (version
7.1) includes it.
However, as a software developer, Libsafe is a useful mechanism
to support defense-in-depth but it does not really prevent buffer
overflows.
Here are several reasons why you shouldn't depend just on Libsafe
during code development:
<P
></P
><UL
><LI
><P
>Libsafe only protects a small set of known functions with obvious
buffer overflow issues.
At the time of this writing, this list is significantly shorter than
the list of functions in this book known to have this problem.
It also won't protect against code you write yourself (e.g., in
a while loop) that causes buffer overflows.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>Even if libsafe is installed in a distribution, the way it is installed
impacts its use.
The documentation recommends setting LD_PRELOAD 
to cause libsafe's protections to be enabled, but the problem
is that users can unset this environment variable... causing the
protection to be disabled for programs they execute!</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>Libsafe only protects against buffer overflows of the stack onto the
return address;
you can still overrun the heap or other variables in that procedure's frame.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>Unless you can be assured that all deployed platforms will use libsafe
(or something like it), you'll have to protect your program as though
it wasn't there.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>LibSafe seems to assume that saved frame pointers are at the beginning of
each stack frame.  This isn't always true. 
Compilers (such as gcc) can optimize away things, and in particular the
option "-fomit-frame-pointer" removes the information that libsafe
seems to need.
Thus, libsafe may fail to work for some programs.</P

shouldn't just depend on libsafe.

>The glib (not glibc) library is a widely-available
open source library that provides
a number of useful functions for C programmers.
GTK+ and GNOME both use glib, for example.
As I noted earlier, in glib version 1.3.2, g_strlcpy() and g_strlcat() have
been added through a patch which I submitted. This should make it easier to
portably use those functions once these later versions of glib
become widely available.
At this time I do not have an analysis showing definitively that the
glib library functions protect against buffer overflows.
However, many of the glib functions automatically allocate memory,
and those functions automatically
<EM
>fail with no reasonable way to intercept the failure</EM
>
(e.g., to try something else instead).
As a result, in many cases most glib functions cannot
be used in most secure programs.
The GNOME guidelines recommend using functions such as
g_strdup_printf(), which is fine as long as it's okay if your program
immediately crashes if an out-of-memory condition occurs.
However, if you can't accept this, then using such routines isn't appropriate.</P
