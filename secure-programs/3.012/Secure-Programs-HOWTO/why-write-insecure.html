>2.3. Why do Programmers Write Insecure Code?</A
></H1
><P
>Many programmers don't intend to write insecure code - but do anyway.
Here are a number of purported reasons for this.
Most of these were collected and summarized by Aleph One on Bugtraq
(in a posting on December 17, 1998):

>There is no curriculum that addresses computer security in most schools.
Even when there <EM
>is</EM
> a computer security curriculum, they
often don't discuss how to write secure programs as a whole.
Many such curriculum only study certain areas such as
cryptography or protocols.
These are important, but they often fail to discuss common real-world issues
such as buffer overflows, string formatting, and input checking.
I believe this is one of the most important problems; even those programmers
who go through colleges and universities are very unlikely to learn
how to write secure programs, yet we depend on those very people to
write secure programs.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>Programming books/classes do not teach secure/safe programming techniques.
Indeed, until recently there were no books on how to write secure programs
at all (this book is one of those few).</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>No one uses formal verification methods.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>C is an unsafe language, and the standard C library string functions
are unsafe.
This is particularly important because C is so widely used -
the ``simple'' ways of using C permit dangerous exploits.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>Programmers do not think ``multi-user.''</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>Programmers are human, and humans are lazy.
Thus, programmers will often use the ``easy'' approach instead of a
secure approach - and once it works, they often fail to fix it later.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>Most programmers are simply not good programmers.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>Most programmers are not security people; they simply don't often
think like an attacker does.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>Most security people are not programmers.
This was a statement made by some Bugtraq contributors, but it's not clear
that this claim is really true.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>Most computer security models are terrible.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>There is lots of ``broken'' legacy software.
Fixing this software (to remove security faults or to make it work with
more restrictive security policies) is difficult.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>Consumers don't care about security.
(Personally, I have hope that consumers are beginning to care about security;
a computer system that is constantly exploited is neither useful
nor user-friendly.
Also, many consumers are unaware that there's
even a problem, assume that it can't happen to them, or think that
that things cannot be made better.)</P

>Security costs extra development time.</P

>Security costs in terms of additional testing
(red teams, etc.).</P
