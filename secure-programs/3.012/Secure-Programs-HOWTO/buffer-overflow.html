>An extremely common security flaw is vulnerability to a ``buffer overflow''.
Buffer overflows are also called ``buffer overruns'', and there are
many kinds of buffer overflow attacks (including
``stack smashing'' and ``heap smashing'' attacks).
Technically, a buffer overflow is a problem with the program's internal
implementation, but it's such a common and serious problem that
I've placed this information in its own chapter.
To give you an idea of how important this subject is,
at the CERT, 9 of 13 advisories in 1998 and at least half of
the 1999 advisories involved buffer overflows.
An informal 1999 survey on Bugtraq found that approximately 2/3 of the
respondents felt that buffer overflows were the leading cause of
system security vulnerability (the remaining respondents identified
``mis-configuration'' as the leading cause) [Cowan 1999].
This is an old, well-known problem, yet it continues to resurface
[McGraw 2000].</P
><P
>A buffer overflow occurs when you write a set of values
(usually a string of characters) into a fixed length buffer
and write at least one value outside that buffer's boundaries
(usually past its end).
A buffer overflow can occur when reading input from the user into a buffer,
but it can also occur during other kinds of processing in a program.</P
><P
>If a secure program permits a buffer overflow, the overflow can often be
exploited by an adversary.
If the buffer is a local C variable, the overflow can be used to
force the function to run code of an attackers' choosing.
This specific variation is often called a ``stack smashing'' attack.
A buffer in the heap isn't much better; attackers may be able to
use such overflows to control other variables in the program.
More details can be found from Aleph1 [1996], Mudge [1995], LSD [2001],
or the Nathan P. Smith's

>Most high-level programming languages are essentially
immune to this problem, either
because they automatically resize arrays (e.g., Perl), or because they normally
detect and prevent buffer overflows (e.g., Ada95).
However, the C language provides no protection against
such problems, and C++ can be easily used in ways to cause this problem too.
Assembly language also provides no protection, and some languages
that normally include such protection (e.g., Ada and Pascal) can have
this protection disabled (for performance reasons).
Even if most of your program is written in another language,
many library routines are written in C or C++, as well as ``glue'' code to
call them, so other languages often don't provide as complete a protection
from buffer overflows as you'd like.</P
