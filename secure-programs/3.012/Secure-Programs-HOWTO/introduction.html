>This book describes a set of guidelines for
writing secure programs on Linux and Unix systems.
For purposes of this book, a ``secure program'' is a program
that sits on a security boundary, taking input from a source that does
not have the same access rights as the program.
Such programs include application programs used as viewers of remote data,
web applications (including CGI scripts),
network servers, and setuid/setgid programs.
This book does not address modifying the operating system kernel itself,
although many of the principles discussed here do apply.
These guidelines were developed as a survey of
``lessons learned'' from various sources on how to create such programs
(along with additional observations by the author),
reorganized into a set of larger principles.
This book includes specific guidance for a number of languages,
including C, C++, Java, Perl, PHP, Python, Tcl, and Ada95.</P

>This book does not cover assurance measures, software engineering
processes, and quality assurance approaches,
which are important but widely discussed elsewhere.
Such measures include testing, peer review,
configuration management, and formal methods.
Documents specifically identifying sets of development
assurance measures for security issues include
the Common Criteria (CC, [CC 1999]) and the
Systems Security Engineering Capability Maturity Model [SSE-CMM 1999].
Inspections and other peer review techniques are discussed in
[Wheeler 1996].
This book does briefly discuss ideas from the CC, but only as an organizational
aid to discuss security requirements.
More general sets of software engineering processes
are defined in documents such as the
Software Engineering Institute's Capability Maturity Model for Software
(SW-CMM) [Paulk 1993a, 1993b]
and ISO 12207 [ISO 12207].
General international standards for quality systems are defined in
ISO 9000 and ISO 9001 [ISO 9000, 9001].
&#13;</P
><P
>This book does not discuss how to configure a system (or network)
to be secure in a given environment. This is clearly necessary for
secure use of a given program,
but a great many other documents discuss secure configurations.
An excellent general book on configuring Unix-like systems to be
secure is Garfinkel [1996].
Other books for securing Unix-like systems include Anonymous [1998].
You can also find information on configuring Unix-like systems at web sites
such as
<A
HREF="http://www.unixtools.com/security.html"
TARGET="_top"
>http://www.unixtools.com/security.html</A
>.
Information on configuring a Linux system to be secure is available in a
wide variety of documents including
Fenzi [1999], Seifried [1999], Wreski [1998], Swan [2001],
and Anonymous [1999].
Geodsoft [2001] describes how to harden OpenBSD,
and many of its suggestions are useful for any Unix-like system.
Information on auditing existing Unix-like systems are discussed in
Mookhey [2002].
For Linux systems (and eventually other Unix-like systems),
you may want to examine the Bastille Hardening System, which
attempts to ``harden'' or ``tighten'' the Linux operating system. 
You can learn more about Bastille at
<A
HREF="http://www.bastille-linux.org"
TARGET="_top"
>http://www.bastille-linux.org</A
>;
it is available for free under the General Public License (GPL).
Other hardening systems include

>grsecurity</A
>.
For Windows 2000, you might want to look at
Cox [2000].
The U.S. National Security Agency (NSA) maintains a set of
security recommendation guides at
<A
HREF="http://nsa1.www.conxion.com"
TARGET="_top"
>http://nsa1.www.conxion.com</A
>,
including the ``60 Minute Network Security Guide.''
If you're trying to establish a public key infrastructure (PKI) using
open source tools, you might want to look at the
<A
HREF="http://ospkibook.sourceforge.net"
TARGET="_top"
>Open Source PKI Book.</A

More about firewalls and Internet security is found in
[Cheswick 1994].</P

>Configuring a computer is only part of Security Management, a larger
area that also covers how to deal with viruses, what kind of
organizational security policy is needed, business continuity plans, and
so on.
There are international standards and guidance for security management.
ISO 13335 is a five-part
technical report giving guidance on security management [ISO 13335].
ISO/IEC 17799:2000 defines a code of practice [ISO 17799];
its stated purpose is to give high-level and general
``recommendations for information security management
for use by those who are responsible for initiating, implementing or
maintaining security in their organization.''
The document specifically identifies itself as
"a starting point for developing organization specific guidance."
It also states that not all of the guidance and controls it contains may be
applicable, and that additional controls not contained may be required.
Even more importantly, they are intended to be
broad guidelines covering a number of areas.
and not intended to give definitive details or "how-tos".
It's worth noting that the original
signing of ISO/IEC 17799:2000 was controversial;
Belgium, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the US
voted <EM
>against</EM
> its adoption.
However, it appears that these votes were primarily a protest on
parliamentary procedure, not on the content of the document,
and certainly people are welcome to use ISO 17799 if they find it helpful.
More information about ISO 17799 can be found in NIST's
<A
HREF="http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/secpubs/otherpubs/reviso-faq.pdf"
TARGET="_top"
>ISO/IEC 17799:2000 FAQ</A
>.
ISO 17799 is highly related to BS 7799 part 1 and 2;
more information about BS 7799 can be found at
<A
HREF="http://www.xisec.com/faq.htm"
TARGET="_top"
>http://www.xisec.com/faq.htm</A
>.
ISO 17799 is currently under revision.
It's important to note that none of these standards
(ISO 13335, ISO 17799, or BS 7799 parts 1 and 2)
are intended to be a detailed set of technical guidelines for software
developers;
they are all intended to provide broad guidelines in a number of areas.
This is important, because software developers who
simply only follow (for example) ISO 17799 will
generally <EM
>not</EM
> produce
secure software - developers need much, much, much
more detail than ISO 17799 provides.</P

>The Commonly Accepted Security Practices &#38; Recommendations (CASPR)
project at
<A
HREF="http://www.caspr.org"
TARGET="_top"
>http://www.caspr.org</A
>
is trying to distill information security knowledge into a series of
papers available to all (under the GNU FDL license, so that future
document derivatives will continue to be available to all).
Clearly, security management needs to include keeping with patches
as vulnerabilities are found and fixed.
Beattie [2002] provides an
interesting analysis on how to determine when to apply patches
contrasting risk of a bad patch to the risk of intrusion
(e.g., under certain conditions, patches are optimally
applied 10 or 30 days after they are released).</P
><P
>If you're interested in the current state of vulnerabilities, there are
other resources available to use.
The CVE at http://cve.mitre.org gives a standard identifier for each
(widespread) vulnerability.
The paper
<A
HREF="http://securitytracker.com/learn/securitytracker-stats-2002.pdf"
TARGET="_top"
>SecurityTracker Statistics</A
>
analyzes vulnerabilities to determine what were the
most common vulnerabilities.
The Internet Storm Center at http://isc.incidents.org/
shows the prominence of various Internet attacks around the world.</P
><P
>This book assumes that the reader understands computer
security issues in general, the general security model of Unix-like systems,
networking (in particular TCP/IP based networks),
and the C programming language.
This book does include some information about the Linux and Unix
programming model for security.
If you need more information on how TCP/IP based networks and protocols
work, including their security protocols, consult general works on
TCP/IP such as [Murhammer 1998].</P
><P
>When I first began writing this document, there were many short articles
but no books on writing secure programs.
There are now two other books on writing secure programs.
One is ``Building Secure Software'' by John Viega and Gary McGraw [Viega 2002];
this is a very good book that discusses a number of important security issues,
but it omits a large number of important security problems that are
instead covered here.
Basically, this book selects several important topics and covers them
well, but at the cost of omitting many other important topics.
The Viega book has a little more information for Unix-like systems than for
Windows systems, but much of it is independent of the kind of system.
The other book is ``Writing Secure Code'' by Michael Howard and David LeBlanc
[Howard 2002].
The title of this other book is misleading;
the book is solely about writing secure programs for Windows,
and is basically worthless if you are writing programs for any other system.
This shouldn't be surprising; it's published by Microsoft press, and its
copyright is owned by Microsoft.
If you are trying to write secure programs for Microsoft's
Windows systems, it's a good book.
Another useful source of secure programming guidance is the
<A
HREF="http://www.owasp.org/guide"
TARGET="_top"
>The Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP)
Guide to Building Secure Web Applications and Web Services</A
>;
it has more on process, and less specifics than this book, but it
has useful material in it.</P
><P
>This book covers all Unix-like systems, including Linux and the
various strains of Unix, and it particularly stresses Linux and provides
details about Linux specifically.
There's some material specifically on Windows CE, and in fact much of
this material is not limited to a particular operating system.
If you know relevant information not already included here, please let
me know.</P

><P
><A
HREF="background.html"
>Chapter 2</A
>
discusses the background of Unix, Linux, and security.
<A
HREF="features.html"
>Chapter 3</A
>
describes the general Unix and Linux security model,
giving an overview of the security attributes and operations of
processes, filesystem objects, and so on.
This is followed by the meat of this book, a set of design and implementation
guidelines for developing applications on Linux and Unix systems.
The book ends with conclusions in
<A
HREF="conclusion.html"
>Chapter 12</A
>,
followed by a lengthy bibliography and appendixes.</P
><P
>The design and implementation guidelines are divided into
categories which I believe emphasize the programmer's viewpoint.
Programs accept inputs, process data, call out to other resources,
and produce output, as shown in <A
HREF="introduction.html#ABSTRACT-PROGRAM"
>Figure 1-1</A
>;
notionally all security guidelines fit into one of these categories.
I've subdivided ``process data'' into
structuring program internals and approach,
avoiding buffer overflows (which in some cases can also be considered
an input issue),
language-specific information, and special topics.
The chapters are ordered to make the material easier to follow.
Thus, the book chapters giving guidelines discuss
validating all input (<A
HREF="input.html"
>Chapter 5</A
>),
avoiding buffer overflows (<A
HREF="buffer-overflow.html"
>Chapter 6</A
>),
structuring program internals and approach (<A
HREF="internals.html"
>Chapter 7</A
>),
carefully calling out to other resources (<A
HREF="call-out.html"
>Chapter 8</A
>),
judiciously sending information back (<A
HREF="output.html"
>Chapter 9</A
>),
language-specific information (<A
HREF="language-specific.html"
>Chapter 10</A
>),
and finally information on special topics such as how to acquire random
numbers (<A
HREF="special.html"
>Chapter 11</A
>).</P
