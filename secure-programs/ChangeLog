2002-06-03  David A. Wheeler <dwheeler@dwheeler.com>
	* Noted algorithmic complexity attacks.

2002-05-21  David A. Wheeler <dwheeler@dwheeler.com>
	* Noted SafeStr.

2002-04-13  David A. Wheeler <dwheeler@dwheeler.com>
	* Added more on PHP functions that execute code.

2002-04-07  David A. Wheeler <dwheeler@dwheeler.com>
	* Noted PHP's safe_mode, disable_functions
	  and open_basedir directives, as well as noting that you should NOT
	  rely on them.
	* Added reference to http://www.etc.msys.ch/docs/chrooted_httpd.pdf
	  which has a nice discussion about employing chroot (it was
	  written specifically to discuss Apache on OpenBSD, but
	  the principles it discusses are actually broader).

2002-03-28  David A. Wheeler <dwheeler@dwheeler.com>
	* Python rexec and Bastion are gone - fundamentally flawed, just
	  as I'd feared.  Noted this.

2002-03-24  David A. Wheeler <dwheeler@dwheeler.com>
	* Noted that you need to minimize the access to data.
	  In particular, check configuration files & abort if they're
	  writeable by all.
	* Added id values to some section1 headings (so their URLs will
	  be better).

2002-03-17  David A. Wheeler <dwheeler@dwheeler.com>
	* Added link to smatch.

2002-03-03  David A. Wheeler <dwheeler@dwheeler.com>
	* Fixed the URL links to Eric Raymond's site:
	  "tuxedo.org" -> "catb.org".

2002-02-18  David A. Wheeler <dwheeler@dwheeler.com>
	* Clarified more about GUI applications.
	* Updated my picture, now it actually looks more like me.
	* Changed URL for libsafe.
	* Renamed LCLint to splint.
	* Mentioned dreamland.

2002-02-16  David A. Wheeler <dwheeler@dwheeler.com>
	* Released version 3.007.

2002-02-02  David A. Wheeler <dwheeler@dwheeler.com>
	* Noted Shamir and Tromir's paper on Factoring Large Numbers with
	  the TWIRL device (a draft paper at this time) - the paper basically
	  suggests that 1024-bit RSA isn't secure either.

2002-01-23  David A. Wheeler <dwheeler@dwheeler.com>
	* Clarified that HttpOnly on cookies is a useful secondary defense,
	  but don't count on it as primary.  I wrote it that way before,
	  but recent papers on "breaks" because some people thought
	  HttpOnly was sufficient as a primary defense made me decide
	  to state this even more clearly.

2002-01-16  David A. Wheeler <dwheeler@dwheeler.com>
	* Expanded the discussion on crypto protocols,
	  in part based on some suggestions from
	  Pawel Krawczyk (kravietz, at echelon ,dot pl).

2002-01-16  David A. Wheeler <dwheeler@dwheeler.com>
	* Referenced Quixote's interesting approach to XSS.
	* Mentioned RMAC.
	* Expanded the Tcl section significantly.
	  Thanks to Wojciech Kocjan (wojciech, at kocjan dot org),
	  who asked me to update the Tcl section and gave me some
	  wrong/right examples of Tcl use that helped clarify the discussion,
	  as well as noting that Tcl 8.0 implements other data types
	  internally and is really more robust than older versions.

2002-01-15  David A. Wheeler <dwheeler@dwheeler.com>
	* Clarified that you should not use "nobody" for your own
	  programs (unless you're writing a webserver) - instead, use the
	  same IDEA of creating pseudousers and groups to isolate
	  programs from each other.  Thanks to Martijn Vernooij
	  tinus, at, win (dot) tue (dot) nl for asking me about this.

2002-12-31  David A. Wheeler <dwheeler@dwheeler.com>
	* Added note about Ada's Inspection_Point. The idea of mentioning
	  Inspection_Point was suggested by Florian Weimer
	  (Weimer, at, CERT dot Uni-Stuttgart, dot DE) - thanks! -
	  but the text as usual is my own.

2002-12-30  David A. Wheeler <dwheeler@dwheeler.com>
	* Version 3.005.  Adds major new text on handling tmp files
	  where there are tmp cleaners running (true on most real systems),
	  notes on avoiding buffer overflow in FD_SET/FD_CLR(), and
	  a long discussion on a new attack against web-based systems:
	  session fixation.  I also added text about
	  protecting secrets in memory.

2002-12-26  David A. Wheeler <dwheeler@dwheeler.com>
	* Made major modifications to the tmp file section based on
	  Michal Zalewski's (lcamtuf, at, coredump, dot cx)
	  very nice article titled "[RAZOR] Problems with mkstemp()".
	  In this paper, posted on Bugtraq but also sent directly to me
	  by him (THANK YOU!), he notes the problems of tmp cleaners and
	  how they introduce races to otherwise non-racy safe uses.

	  Thankfully, it appears that my earlier suggestion on how to do
	  this in C is fine, since it's file descriptor based.
	  HOWEVER, before I had suggested NOT using temp files in shell,
	  but if you had to, use mktemp(1).  It turns out my intuition was
	  correct - you really can't do it safely in shell at all,
	  even with mktemp(1), in tmp cleaning environments where an
	  attacker can influence /tmp.  Since this describes a number
	  of environments (and sometimes environments change INTO this
	  circumstance), it's much safer to just not do it.

	* Expanded the discussion of OpenWall, and gave the specific
	  rules used in the LSM version of OpenWall.  That way,
	  people can write their code to run correctly in OpenWall-protected
	  systems running the LSM version of OpenWall.

	* Added a note about FD_SET() and FD_CLR() thanks to the
	  Timo Sirainen (tss, at, iki dot fi), who very helpfully noted:
	   Just occured to me a while ago that FD_SET() and FD_CLR() don't
	   do any buffer size checks. After a bit of googleing I didn't
	   see this mentioned pretty anywhere else than
	   in recent pppd vulnerability, which exploited exactly this problem.
	   I don't think it's obvious to most people that the
	   check should be done, especially because fd_set isn't even
	   defined to be an array. Linux's select() man page doesn't even
	   say anything about FD_SETSIZE.


2002-12-19  David A. Wheeler <dwheeler@dwheeler.com>
	* Added long discussion on session fixation.

2002-11-19  David A. Wheeler <dwheeler@dwheeler.com>
	* Significant additional discussion about protecting secrets
	  in memory, in particular mlock() and scrubbing secrets in memory.
	  In particular, added discussion about what you need to do to
	  avoid having the C/C++ compiler optimize away memory overwrites
	  (this is an old & well-known issue, but the recent Bugtraq
	  discussion jogged my memory and realized that I hadn't specifically
	  discussed it in the book).
	* Noted Perl's File::Temp.  My thanks to Steven M. Christey,
	  coley (at, linus.mitre.org), for pointing this out.

2002-10-29  David A. Wheeler <dwheeler@dwheeler.com>
	* Released version 3.000.

2002-8-13  David A. Wheeler <dwheeler@dwheeler.com>
	* Added long discussion about security requirements, in particular
	  emphasizing the Common Criteria.
	* Noted that SQL metacharacter insertion is often called
	  "SQL injection".

2002-7-13  David A. Wheeler <dwheeler@dwheeler.com>
	* Various small improvements.

2002-4-29  David A. Wheeler <dwheeler@dwheeler.com>
	* Thanks to Bastian Kleineidam, who noted that Java's clone()
	  returns Object, not void.

2002-4-10  David A. Wheeler <dwheeler@dwheeler.com>
	* Mentioned "Mastering Regular Expressions"... he has a
	  regular expression for checking email addresses.. and  it's
	  so long that it SHOWS how hard it is to really check
	  email addresses.

2002-4-10  David A. Wheeler <dwheeler@dwheeler.com>
	* Updated slides slightly, and re-posted.

2002-4-09  David A. Wheeler <dwheeler@dwheeler.com>
	* Added link to Crypto Law Survey.

2002-4-02  David A. Wheeler <dwheeler@dwheeler.com>
	* Added note about Openwall temp directory policy.

2002-3-28  David A. Wheeler <dwheeler@dwheeler.com>
	* Added reference to http://www.enseirb.fr/~glaume/indexen.html
	  (buffer overflow study)

2002-3-25  David A. Wheeler <dwheeler@dwheeler.com>
	* Recommend 2048-bit, not 1024-bit, keys for RSA.
	  Recent factoring algorithm improvements make it possible for
	  well-funded organizations to break in 1024-bit quickly.
	  See Bugtraq, 23 Mar 2002, "1024-bit RSA keys in danger of compromise"
	  by "Lucky Green" <shamrock@cypherpunks.to>.
	  Bruce Scheier has a countering opinion, but frankly, why risk it?
	  This is an area where using a few more bits is usually easy,
	  so just do it.

2002-3-18  David A. Wheeler <dwheeler@dwheeler.com>
	* Noted perl users want people to use sudo, not suidperl.
	* Noted ORDB as another anti-spam service.

2002-3-14  David A. Wheeler <dwheeler@dwheeler.com>
	* Release version 2.963 to internal website.
	* Modified my local document generation process.
	  It turns out that the version numbers weren't printing on
	  the copies I was generating!! That's fixed now.
	* Fixed date of zlib bug (it's 2002, not 2001).
	  My thanks to Colin Simmonds (Nortel Networks), who noticed this
	  mistake only two days after I released my book.  
	  And wow - there must be a lot of people looking at my book, to
	  so quickly notice a minor error in an update in the middle
	  of the book!
	* Mentioned Valgrind and Electric Fence, two tools that can help
	  counter double-free()ing problems like zlib's.

2002-3-11  David A. Wheeler <dwheeler@dwheeler.com>
	* Released version 2.961.
	* Added note about double-free'ing, and the environment variables
	  that can be used to counter the problem.
	* Added note about avoiding off-by-one bugs.  That's really
	  a general "avoid bugs" issue, but I thought it'd be
	  worth mentioning.
	* Spelling error fixed ("relased" -> "released").

2002-3-8  David A. Wheeler <dwheeler@dwheeler.com>
	* Added info about spam.
	* Added note on CRT Eavesdropping.

2002-3-7  David A. Wheeler <dwheeler@dwheeler.com>
	* Mentioned NSA's nsa1.www.conxion.com website.

2002-3-4  David A. Wheeler <dwheeler@dwheeler.com>
	* Expanded slightly on the "mutually untrusting programs" description.
	  This was hinted at in Qmail's discussion, though I didn't use
	  any text other than that phrase.  I added a note that I need
	  to go back to the Qmail text to really deal with it further.
	* Fixed two small typos noted by Thomas Klausner

2002-3-2  David A. Wheeler <dwheeler@dwheeler.com>
	* Released version 2.95.
	* Fixed URL (securingjava.com), which had a side-effect of
	  creating a minor plucker error.

2002-2-26  David A. Wheeler <dwheeler@dwheeler.com>
	* Released version 2.94 (to my website).
	* addition->additional, noted by Pat Gunn.
	* std:string in C++ doesn't auto-convert to char*, my bad.
	  The problem is that some OTHER string libraries do so.
	  Thanks to Per Mellstrand for pointing this out.
	* Made a MAJOR change on my local website in the tools I use.
	  I now primarily use the LDP tools.  As a result, the PDF is
	  better (with hyperlinks and a nicer TOC), the HTML has
	  section numbers, MUCH better ASCII text, a one-page HTML,
	  and plucker format.  Thus, my website's results are nicer,
	  and I can be more certain about the results that the LDP gives too.

2002-2-21  David A. Wheeler <dwheeler@dwheeler.com>
	* Mentioned Fenris.
	* Modified URL to Kirch's paper; unix-vs-nt.org appears to have
	  permanently gone down, and I can't get hold of John Kirch,
	  so I now link to the Internet Archive copy.

2002-2-9  David A. Wheeler <dwheeler@dwheeler.com>
	* Released version 2.93.
	* Added text about semantic attacks.
	* More discussion about shells and their problems.

2002-2-6  David A. Wheeler <dwheeler@dwheeler.com>
	* Added note from David deVitry - in some circumstances
	  web browsers can be fooled into automatically POSTing form data.
	  It's still a good idea to ignore GET and require POST for
	  some operations, as discussed in the text.

2002-2-1  David A. Wheeler <dwheeler@dwheeler.com>
	* Added warnings about strncpy() and seteuid(), based on
	  comments from Philip Hazel.
	* Added notes on SQL metacharacters, based on
	  http://www.spidynamics.com/papers/SQLInjectionWhitePaper.pdf 

2002-1-7  David A. Wheeler <dwheeler@dwheeler.com>
	* Fixed UTF-8 table format.

2002-1-7  David A. Wheeler <dwheeler@dwheeler.com>
	* Released version 2.91.

2002-1-3  David A. Wheeler <dwheeler@dwheeler.com>
	* Changed the UTF-8 legal values table.  The original table
	  was WRONG, ack!!  This stuff is quite tricky; many
	  didn't notice the problem earlier.  Thanks to
	  Peter Astrand who noted the problem, and who pointed me to
	  http://www.unicode.org/unicode/uni2errata/UTF-8_Corrigendum.html
	  which has a correct table.

2002-1-3  David A. Wheeler <dwheeler@dwheeler.com>
	* Added more about checking URIs; the idea was suggested by
	  John Levon.

2001-12-28  David A. Wheeler <dwheeler@dwheeler.com>
	* Added more text about PHP, based on some suggestions by
	  Richard Lynch.

2001-12-17  David A. Wheeler <dwheeler@dwheeler.com>
	* Added a reference to Cyclone, including Viega's review.
	* I haven't added a "why write secure programs" section.
	  If I do, I'll probably mention gems like this one
	  titled "Cyberattacks increase after Sept. 11"
	  by Dibya Sarkar:
	  "In Orlando, Florida, there has been a nearly 300-fold
	  increase in cyberattacks, and most IP addresses show they're
	  from the Middle East and Pakistan, said John, Matelski, Orlando's
	  deputy CIO, who advises the mayor.
	   Before Sept. 11, he said the city averaged about 50 intrusion
	  attacks per month.  After the attacks, the city has
	  averaged about 14,000 per month.
	   "Many of these intrusion attempts are not volatile.
	  They're merely probes to find deficiencies and perhaps do harm,"
	  Matelski said.
	    Federal Computer Week, December 3, 2001, page S19.
	  

2001-12-11  David A. Wheeler <dwheeler@dwheeler.com>
	* Added discussion of new PHP (4.1.0), which makes it easier to
	  write PHP software with register_globals off, and
	  warns that this will become the default.

2001-10-15  David A. Wheeler <dwheeler@dwheeler.com>
	* Added reference to Kurt Seifried's paper on web authentication.

2001-10-10  David A. Wheeler <dwheeler@dwheeler.com>
	* Incorporated many suggestions from Bill Brykczynski.
	* Switched to DocBook version 4.1 (from 3.1).
	* Began using a stylesheet.
	* Switched to a different spelling checker (aspell), which found
	  a number of speeling priblems.
	* Added a lot of material about web authentication.
	* Added a long discussion on cryptography, including suggestions
	  on recommended algorithms.

2001-7-24  David A. Wheeler <dwheeler@dwheeler.com>
	* Added link to [LSD 2001].

2001-7-16  David A. Wheeler <dwheeler@dwheeler.com>
	* New link to BFBTester, and it now works on Linux (yay!).

2001-7-6  David A. Wheeler <dwheeler@dwheeler.com>
	* Added a new section on PHP.  This is based on Clowes' work,
	  though many of the actual recommendations are my own.
	* Fixed a number of grammer and typo errors - my thanks to
	  Moritz Jodeit, who sent me a nice long set of fixes!

2001-7-5  David A. Wheeler <dwheeler@dwheeler.com>
	* Noted PyChecker.

2001-6-14  David A. Wheeler <dwheeler@dwheeler.com>
	* Noted that to really drop privileges you may also need to
	  reset the supplemental groups.

2001-6-08  David A. Wheeler <dwheeler@dwheeler.com>
	* Fixed typo, 'fileystem'.

2001-6-04  David A. Wheeler <dwheeler@dwheeler.com>
	* Added reference to Geodsoft's hardening OpenBSD info.

2001-5-31  David A. Wheeler <dwheeler@dwheeler.com>
	* Added reference to Zalewski's "Delivering Signals for Fun and
	  Profit", and some more material on signals based on it.

2001-5-30  David A. Wheeler <dwheeler@dwheeler.com>
	* Fixed grammatical error in the open source security section.
	* Released version 2.87.

2001-5-24  David A. Wheeler <dwheeler@dwheeler.com>
	* Updated the description of ITS4, added references to
	  RATS and flawfinder.
	* Local release as version 2.86.

2001-5-16  David A. Wheeler <dwheeler@dwheeler.com>
	* Added reference to Cox 2000 (Windows 2000 secure configuration).

2001-5-10  David A. Wheeler <dwheeler@dwheeler.com>
	* Added reference to Murhammer as a general TCP/IP reference.

2001-5-09  David A. Wheeler <dwheeler@dwheeler.com>
	* Mentioned the Entropy Gathering Daemon.

2001-5-07  David A. Wheeler <dwheeler@dwheeler.com>
	* Mentioned Jerry Connolly's http://heap.nologin.net/aspsec.html
	  web page for ASP input issues.
	* Mentioned inconsistent strlcat semantics when size==0 or there
	  are no embedded NIL characters.
	* Mentioned GID==0 - it's VERY special on some Unix-like systems,
	  and it's all-powerful on most anyway.

2001-4-23  David A. Wheeler <dwheeler@dwheeler.com>
	* Extended discussion on persistent cookies, in particular noting
	  that they are illegal on U.S. government sites (with a reference).

2001-4-23  David A. Wheeler <dwheeler@dwheeler.com>
	* Mentioned linux-security-module
	* Referenced "Vulnerability Assessment Scanners" by Forristal.

2001-4-05  David A. Wheeler <dwheeler@dwheeler.com>
	* Expanded discussion of trusted path and trustworthy channels.
	* Noted that when fixing a vulnerability, log later attempts.

2001-3-30  David A. Wheeler <dwheeler@dwheeler.com>
	* Added cross-references and other information noting that, at
	  installation time, you should check your system assumptions
	  necessary for security.

2001-3-22  David A. Wheeler <dwheeler@dwheeler.com>
	* Noted the problem with globbing.

2001-3-20  David A. Wheeler <dwheeler@dwheeler.com>
	* Added reference to Halvar Flake's slides on disassembling closed
	  source programs.

2001-3-06  David A. Wheeler <dwheeler@dwheeler.com>
	* Added reference to http://www-syntim.inria.fr/fractales/Staff/
	  Raynal/LinuxMag/SecProg/Art4/index.html
	* Added note about rfork().

2001-2-28  David A. Wheeler <dwheeler@dwheeler.com>
	* Noted that you need to load initialization values from a trusted
	  location (based on recent problems with Joe)
	* Added reference to IETF RFC 1750 (Randomness Recommendations
	  for Security).
	* Noted that Mandrake 7.1 includes libsafe.

2001-2-27  David A. Wheeler <dwheeler@dwheeler.com>
	* Fixed many minor typos - thanks to John Levon who identified them.
	* Noted various security extensions, such as FreeBSD's jail(2)
	  and the huge numbers of research efforts for Linux (Janus,
	  Subterfugue, NSA Linux/Flask, RSBAC, etc.).  Sometime I'll have to
	  add the information on Trusted Solaris, etc., but for the moment
	  I refer to NSA's "Evaluated Product List" which has specific
	  information on the security approaches of some of them.
	* Noted "fuzz".
	* Added a reference to William Stalling's excellent collection
	  of papers, "Practical Cryptography for Data Internetworks."

2001-2-8  David A. Wheeler <dwheeler@dwheeler.com>
	* Noted other shell special characters, in particular the whitespace
	  characters that separate parameters.

2001-1-12 David A. Wheeler <dwheeler@dwheeler.com>
	* Released version 2.75.
	* Moved from DocBook 3.0 to DocBook 3.1.  I tried doing this
	  earlier, but I forgot to change "Davenport" to "OASIS" and got
	  lots of error messages.  The right header obviously matters!
	* Added a figure ("program") showing my abstract view of programs;
	  it's not deep, but it helps to logically keep things straight.
	  The master file is "program.dia", which is editable with the
	  open source (GPL'ed) program "Dia" available at
	  http://www.lysator.liu.se/~alla/dia (and in many distributions).
	  It's not beautiful (I'm no artist), but hopefully it helps
	  explain the idea.
	* Switched to distributing a tarball, so the figure is included.
	* Modified the random number section, after 
	  Jordan Dimov <jdimov@cis.clarion.edu> rightly complained that my
	  phrase 'truly random numbers' was somewhat misleading.
	  Fair enough, I was glossing over the details (which I knew) -
	  hopefully this version gives the bigger picture.
	  I ended up basically rewriting the section.
	* Added section about "Open Source" and security.

2001-1-1 David A. Wheeler <dwheeler@dwheeler.com>
	* Released the book as version 2.70.
	  Seriously extended and modified the book, adding lengthy
	  discussions about cross-site malicious content, verifying
	  HTML and URIs, and creating temporary files.
	  Did a number of clean-ups and various additions, too.

2000-12-4 David A. Wheeler <dwheeler@dwheeler.com>
	* Added a section, "prevent-include-access".
	I was reminded of this issue by the Bugtraq posting of 1 Dec 2000
	by Mads Bach (bach@INDER.NET), with the subject line
        "Web based apps and include files".
	* Added a section about not including comments in returned data.

2000-11-10 David A. Wheeler <dwheeler@dwheeler.com>
	* Added information about Java not enforcing "private" etc.
	  from null/trusted Classloaders, my thanks to
	  John Steven who noted this!
	* Added reference to sci.crypt and their FAQ.
	* Modified the definition of "Availability" due to a
	  comment by Alan Santos.
	* Fixed discussion about sprintf().. you _can_ use sprintf()
	  to avoid buffer overflows, but its use is tricky.

2000-10-30 David A. Wheeler <dwheeler@dwheeler.com>
	* Added a reference to the GLB Act (a new U.S. law)

2000-10-26 David A. Wheeler <dwheeler@dwheeler.com>
	* Added a note that you should only call to programs intended for
	  calling by another program.

2000-10-26 David A. Wheeler <dwheeler@dwheeler.com>
	* Michael Kerrisk mentioned that #defining
	   _SVID_SOURCE or _BSD_SOURCE, then #include <features.h>,
	   will cause __USE_MISC to be defined (and allow clearenv).

2000-10-24 David A. Wheeler <dwheeler@dwheeler.com>
	* Added a discussion about vfork.  John Levon pointed me to the
	  issue, which was written up by Solar Designer.

2000-10-03 David A. Wheeler <dwheeler@dwheeler.com>
	* Company name change; RST became "Cigital".

2000-09-05 David A. Wheeler <dwheeler@dwheeler.com>
	* Added a note about web bugs.

2000-09-03 David A. Wheeler <dwheeler@dwheeler.com>
	* Added a number of internal cross-references (29 currently).
	  Now that I've given all sections an "id", I can use the
	  "xref" tag effectively.  This should really help readers
	  follow the text in some places... now you can easily jump
	  to related material in the text.
	* Added "Free Software" to some titles as well as
	  "Open Source Software", and pointed to the FSF for more
	  such information.  Also fixed a typo.

2000-09-01 David A. Wheeler <dwheeler@dwheeler.com>
	* Modified Conclusions and "atomic" section to emphasize the
	  problems with /tmp and /var/tmp directories (especially
	  how attackers create symbolic links in them to cause trouble).
	* Modified the SGML so that all <sectX> (as well as all chapters)
	  have a reasonable "id" attached.  Now all HTML filenames have
	  meaningful filenames, as well as the sections inside.
	  This will make it easier for people to externally link to
	  specific sections of the document.
	* Added note that glibc _does_ filter the LANG setting for
	  setuid/setgid, but that it's been buggy (Red Hat released a fix
	  on September 1, 2000).

2000-08-28 David A. Wheeler <dwheeler@dwheeler.com>
	* Added the note that MD5 is rumored to be broken (& referenced
	  the 22 August 2000 posting in Bugtraq that raised this).
	  I don't want to be a rumormonger, but since MD5 has already been
	  shown to be partly broken, this seems quite plausible; besides,
	  a better algorithm is available, so this is yet another reason
	  to switch.

2000-08-21 David A. Wheeler <dwheeler@dwheeler.com>
	* Added information that strlcpy/strlcat are being added to glib
	  (I'm the one that implemented & recommended the patch, based
	  on the original BSD work).
	* Added "id" entries for chapters - it improves HTML filenames
	  and begins to add usable internal links.

2000-07-31 David A. Wheeler <dwheeler@dwheeler.com>
	* Moved filtering locale information into the "input" section,
	  since that's where it logically went.  Expanded it, since
	  many may not know about i18n.
	* Released version 2.31.

2000-07-27 David A. Wheeler <dwheeler@dwheeler.com>
	* Added more information about formatting strings and
	  internationalization (i18n).
	* Released version 2.30.

2000-07-23 David A. Wheeler <dwheeler@dwheeler.com>
	* Added in some information (and an example) from the GNOME
	  Programming guidelines.
	* Added a note and reference to Byte, April 1986, which discusses
	  some of the issues with terminal escape codes.

2000-07-18 David A. Wheeler <dwheeler@dwheeler.com>
	* Added warnings about formatting characters to printf()
	  and family, including %n, as well as other formatting systems
	  like syslog().  My thanks to John Levon for reminding
	  me to do this, and for reviewing my early drafts.
	* The bugtraq message about safely using sprintf with the width
	  modifier didn't sound right to me, so I double-checked it.
	  I found that in fact it is completely unsafe!
	  Not all bugtraq posters check their claims, that's for sure!
	  So, modified the text to note that this is UNsafe.
	* Modified BFBTester reference, noting that it's GPLed.  I also worked
	  with the BFBTester author to get it ported to Linux; turns out
	  a subtlety with threads made waitpid() not work the way he
	  expected (because threads are Linux processes, and an "uncle"
	  cannot wait on its "nephew").
	* Moved tools to be under "Miscellaneous", instead of C-centric;
	  many tools aren't C/C++-centric, and even those that are might
	  change later, so may as well put them in a place that they'll stay.
	  It's easier to compare tools if similar kinds are all in one place.
	* Added warnings about protecting the output of syslog().

2000-07-03 David A. Wheeler <dwheeler@dwheeler.com>
	* Added example of "safe" use of sprintf (length option)
	  from bugtraq posting. [but see 2000-07-18]

2000-06-29 David A. Wheeler <dwheeler@dwheeler.com>
	* Added reference to BFBTester.

2000-06-28 David A. Wheeler <dwheeler@dwheeler.com>
	* Added warning about signed char.

2000-06-22 David A. Wheeler <dwheeler@dwheeler.com>
	* Expanded the section on race conditions.

2000-06-07 David A. Wheeler <dwheeler@dwheeler.com>
	* Added text about ITS4 and LClint. Mentioned Shmoo and made sure
	  that I had everything they did.
	* Added info from Martin Douda on other problematic shell characters.
	* Added a few nuggets on Java and C from
	  http://java.sun.com/security/seccodeguide.html
	* Added many more references to related security information.
	* Explained more about shell scripting languages &
	  why they're a problem.

2000-06-02 David A. Wheeler <dwheeler@dwheeler.com>
	* Added reference to the Python Restricted Environment stuff.
	  Added my own warning about only copying in references
	  (I didn't see such a warning in any material I have).

2000-05-24 David A. Wheeler <dwheeler@dwheeler.com>
	* Switched to GNU Free Documentation License (FDL), which is
	  designed for documents (the GPL really wasn't).

2000-05-22 David A. Wheeler <dwheeler@dwheeler.com>
	* Began adding more language-specific information, such as Perl
	  info from perlsec(1) and perlopentut(1), moving C
	  compiler flags into its own section, etc.
	* Significantly extended the Java-specific section, based on
	  the two leading Java security books.

2000-05-18 David A. Wheeler <dwheeler@dwheeler.com>
	* Received several suggestions from Doug Kilpatrick: extend UTF-8
	  description, mention that the Linux kernel writers use the term
	  "task" not "process", talk more about not depending on
	  stdin/stdout/stderr being open (I mentioned it before though),
	  add "-O2" to the recommended gcc flag list (some dataflow
	  checks require this).

2000-04-25 David A. Wheeler <dwheeler@dwheeler.com>
	* Minor grammar fixes.
	* Marc Welz pointed out that in Linux 2.2  you can determine the
	   pid, uid and gid using:
	   getsockopt(fd, SOL_SOCKET, SO_PEERCRED, &cr, &cl)

2000-04-22 David A. Wheeler <dwheeler@dwheeler.com>
	* Added discussion on Lucent's libsafe.
	  While writing this discussion, I sent Lucent several notes on
	  issues in libsafe. In particular, they failed to discuss in their
	  documentation the fact that depending on LD_PRELOAD
	  to enable libsafe makes it possible for evil local users to
	  disable libsafe on programs they run!  Also, I sent them
	  a list of other "dangerous" functions that they didn't cover.
	* Added more comments of "things I want to cover".  Okay, that's
 	  not the same as actually discussing them, but it's a start.

2000-04-21 David A. Wheeler <dwheeler@dwheeler.com>
	* Version 2.00 released, dated 21 April 2000.  This version is
	  identical to version 1.60 in content, but switches format
	  from the Linuxdoc DTD to the DocBook DTD.
	  Thanks to Jorge Godoy for helping me perform the transition.
	  There are a few rough spots; DocBook experts are welcome to give
	  me a hand.  I now generate RTF.  The ASCII text file format is
	  quite poor; I can't help that, the tools aren't ready yet.

2000-04-04 David A. Wheeler <dwheeler@dwheeler.com>
	* Version 1.60 released.
	* Changed so that it now covers BOTH Linux and Unix.  Since most
 	  of the guidelines covered both, and many/most app developers want
 	  their apps to run on both, it made sense to cover both.
	  Much of the detail still only discusses Linux, which I intend to
	  fix over time; suggestions on what to add would be great!
	* This meant adding some history about Unix (as well as Linux),
	  discussing in a few places variations (more discussion needed), etc.

2000-03-08 David A. Wheeler <dwheeler@dwheeler.com>
	* It's too long, so I changed the type from "article" to "book".
	  That meant that sect became chapt, sect1 became sect, etc.
	* Added Biblical quotations to head every chapter, for the
	  enjoyment of the reader.

2000-03-06 David A. Wheeler <dwheeler@dwheeler.com>
	* Added more information on using strlcpy and strlcat.
	* Expanded conclusions so it actually summarizes the key points.
	* Various minor improvements.  Well, I _hope_ they're improvements!

2000-03-05 David A. Wheeler <dwheeler@dwheeler.com>
	* Added a brief discussion of confidentiality, integrity, and
	  availability.  Anybody who knows about security should know about
	  this, but since it's assumed elsewhere in the text I thought it's
	  worth mentioning.
	* Added more information about signals, locking, etc.  I don't want
	  this to be a general-purpose programming primer, but some things
	  seem worth summarizing.

2000-03-03 David A. Wheeler <dwheeler@dwheeler.com>
	* Added reference to "Applied Cryptography" and the
	  "Linux Encryption HOWTO".
	* Added a note about ext2's reserved space for root (as a
	  preventative for denial-of-service attacks), with a reference
	  to mke2fs(8).
	* Added a new "Credits" section in the document itself to give
	  people credit.  See the ChangeLog file (this one) for the details.
	  And, responded to many suggestions, as noted below.
	* Eric S. Raymond <thanks.esr@snark.thyrsus.com> said "Nice work,
	  in general.. but I believe you have "fail open" and
	  "fail closed" reversed." Fair enough. I decided that I really meant
	  "fail safe" instead of either term, and I added a discussion
	  about that.  
	* Paul Millar <thanks.paulm@astro.gla.ac.uk> found I'd used
	   /var/log/ where I meant /var/lock/; corrected, I added
	  reference to the FHS for more information, and added some material
	  from the FHS in the hopes that people will use standard conventions
	  when they apply!
	* John Levon <thanks.moz@compsoc.man.ac.uk> suggested noting that
	  you should drop privs while parsing input, describe digest
	  passwords, mention "safer" users (like "nobody"), and mention
	  rate-limiting audit trails.  I knew about these, but I didn't
	  call them out.  So, I wrote text to cover those points.
	* A (user who prefers to be anonymous) asked how to set the
	  global environment to NULL, noting that # unset environ; set
	  or # environ='' set   don't work.  As far as I know, you need
	  to put a small "wrapper" program around sh scripts to do this,
	  so I've added that note to the document.
	* Ryan McCabe <thanks.odin@numb.org> gave a really GOOD note that
	  fixed-length strings have a built-in weakness; you can exploit
	  them by providing information around their length and cause
	  some routines to silently fail to append data.
	* Chuck Phillips <thanks.cdp@peakpeak.com> noted a more efficient
	  way to use strncpy, which I added.  He also couldn't believe
	  that strncpy NIL-filled, and sent me a long note explaining why
	  it shouldn't.  I agree that it shouldn't, but in spite of all
	  rational reasons for why it shouldn't, it DOES!  So, I added
	  references to K&R 2nd edition (page 249), and the man pages for
	  Solaris, Linux, and FreeBSD, to show that this horrible thing
	  is actually true, logic to the contrary.
	* Scott Ingram <thanks.scott@silver.jhuapl.edu> mentioned that
	  configuration is the number one problem.  I agreed, and in fact I
	  already noted that in the text, but that got me thinking that I
	  should specifically recommend making things easy to configure (as well
	  as using safe defaults).  If more programs did that, we'd have
	  a lot fewer cracked machines.
	* Martin Pool <thanks.mbp@humbug.org.au> suggested noting that
	  sometimes scripting languages can do a setenv() and affect its
	  caller.  He also suggested mentioning dynamically linked libraries,
	  but I'd already planned to do that.
	  He also suggested mentioning the ideas on breaking out of chroot
	  in http://www.suid.edu/source/breakchroot.c; I actually summarized
	  it in the text, it's just yet another example of why having root
	  privileges is enough to break out of chroot jails.
	* Chuck Phillips <thanks.cdp@peakpeak.com>,
	  Neil Brown <thanks.neilb@cse.unsw.edu.au>, and
	  Eric Werme USG <thanks.werme@alpha.zk3.dec.com> discussed NFS issues
	  with me which yielded the insight that, although NFS version 2
	  is "broken as described," version 3 _does_ support exclusive
	  file creation.  Sadly, there are still many NFS version 2 users,
	  so we can't depend on this, but the discussion did
	  suggest to me some enhancements to the text on creating locks
	  using files.


2000-02-09 David A. Wheeler <dwheeler@dwheeler.com>
	* Noted that the document is now part of the Linux Documentation
	  Project (LDP).
	* Added more references, such as [Mudge 1995], [McClure 1999],
	  [Bellovin 1989], and Nathan P. Smith's
	  "Stack Smashing Security Vulnerabilities" website.

2000-01-06 David A. Wheeler <dwheeler@dwheeler.com>
	* Grammo: in section "Library Solutions", s/requires/require/

2000-01-05 David A. Wheeler <dwheeler@dwheeler.com>
	* Released version 1.24; announced to http://lwn.net and
	  http://www.securityportal.com.

2000-01-05 David A. Wheeler <dwheeler@dwheeler.com>
	* Added information on "why did you write your own document"?
	* Added information on more per-process attributes, in particular
	  limits and the filesystem root.
	* Noted that filesystem quotas can be per-group as well as per-user.
	* Fixed a ~, which in this DTD must be written as &tilde;.
	* Fixed a few typos, thanks to review by Clyde Roby <croby@ida.org>

1999-12-30 David A. Wheeler <dwheeler@dwheeler.com>
	* Added some information on POSIX capabilities & the bounding set.
	* Added information explaining rwx permissions on directories.

1999-12-23 David A. Wheeler <dwheeler@dwheeler.com>
	* Now at version 1.20.
	* Added major new section, section 2, that describes the Linux
	  programming model for security (e.g., file attributes, etc.).
	  I determined that there really isn't a single good place that has
	  this kind of information, and where better than to include it in
	  information on how to write secure programs?
	* Moved the "buffer overflow" section out into its own section, since
	  it's so important.  Added more information about StackGuard, etc.
	* Mentions glib in the buffer overflow section; if anyone wishes to
	  analyze the implementation to determine which glib functions protect
	  against buffer overflow I'd like to know about them.
	* Added some references to PAM.
	* Various other fixes.

1999-12-03 David A. Wheeler <dwheeler@dwheeler.com>
	* Fixed minor grammar error in CGI section, added PDF format.
	* Added "favicon.ico" so Internet Explorer users, should they bookmark
	  this site, will get Tux as a logo.  Seems fair :-).

1999-11-30  David A. Wheeler <dwheeler@dwheeler.com>
	* Added GPL license, reference to http://www.dwheeler.com.


1999-11-29  David A. Wheeler <dwheeler@dwheeler.com>
	* Initial version (1.0) completed.
