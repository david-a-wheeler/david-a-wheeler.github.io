></H1
><P
>Saltzer [1974] and later Saltzer and Schroeder [1975]
list the following design principles when creating secure programs,
which are still valid:

<P
></P
><UL
><LI
><P
><EM
>Least privilege</EM
>.
Each user and program should operate using the fewest privileges possible.
This principle limits the damage from an accident, error, or attack.
It also reduces the number of potential interactions among privileged programs,
so unintentional,
unwanted, or improper uses of privilege are less likely to occur. 
This idea can be extended to the internals of a program: only the smallest
portion of the program which needs those privileges should have them.
See <A
HREF="minimize-privileges.html"
>Section 7.4</A
> for more about how to do this.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
><EM
>Economy of mechanism/Simplicity</EM
>.
The protection system&#8217;s design should be simple and
small as possible.
In their words,
<SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>&#8220;techniques such as line-by-line inspection of software and physical
examination of hardware that implements protection mechanisms are necessary.
For such techniques to be successful,
a small and simple design is essential.&#8221;</SPAN
>
This is sometimes described as the <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>&#8220;KISS&#8221;</SPAN
> principle
(<SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>&#8220;keep it simple, stupid&#8221;</SPAN
>).</P
></LI
><LI
><P
><EM
>Open design</EM
>.
The protection mechanism must not depend on attacker ignorance.
Instead, the mechanism should be public, depending on the secrecy of
relatively few (and easily changeable) items like passwords or private keys.
An open design makes extensive public scrutiny possible, and it also
makes it possible for users to convince themselves that the system about
to be used is adequate.
Frankly, it isn&#8217;t realistic to try to maintain secrecy for a system that
is widely distributed;
decompilers and subverted hardware can quickly expose any <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>&#8220;secrets&#8221;</SPAN
>
in an implementation.
Even if you pretend that source code is necessary to find exploits (it isn&#8217;t),
source code has often been stolen and redistributed
(at least once from Cisco and twice from Microsoft).
This is one of the oldest and strongly supported principles, based
on many years in cryptography.
For example, the older Kerckhoffs&#8217;s Law states
that "A cryptosystem
should be designed to be secure if everything is known about it except
the key information."
Claude Shannon, the inventor of information theory, restated Kerckhoff&#8217;s Law
as: "[Assume] the enemy knows the system."
Indeed, security expert
Bruce Schneier goes further and
argues that smart engineers should
<SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>&#8220;demand open source code for anything related to security&#8221;</SPAN
>,
as well as ensuring that it receives widespread review and that
any identified problems are fixed [Schneier 1999].</P
></LI
><LI
><P
><EM
>Complete mediation</EM
>.
Every access attempt must be checked; position the mechanism
so it cannot be subverted.
A synonym for this goal is
<EM
>non-bypassability</EM
>.
For example, in a client-server model, generally the server must do all
access checking because users can build or modify their own clients.
This is the point of all of
<A
HREF="input.html"
>Chapter 5</A
>, as well as
<A
HREF="secure-interface.html"
>Section 7.2</A
>.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
><EM
>Fail-safe defaults (e.g., permission-based approach)</EM
>.
The default should be denial of service, and the
protection scheme should then identify conditions under which
access is permitted.
See <A
HREF="safe-configure.html"
>Section 7.7</A
> and <A
HREF="fail-safe.html"
>Section 7.10</A
>
for more.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
><EM
>Separation of privilege</EM
>.
Ideally, access to objects should depend on more than one condition, so
that defeating one protection system won&#8217;t enable complete access.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
><EM
>Least common mechanism</EM
>.
Minimize the amount and
use of shared mechanisms (e.g. use of the /tmp or /var/tmp directories).
Shared objects provide potentially dangerous channels for information
flow and unintended interactions.
See <A
HREF="avoid-race.html"
>Section 7.11</A
> for more information.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
><EM
>Psychological acceptability / Easy to use</EM
>.
The human interface must be designed for ease of use so users will routinely
and automatically use the protection mechanisms correctly.
Mistakes will be reduced if
the security mechanisms closely match the user&#8217;s mental image of
his or her protection goals.</P
