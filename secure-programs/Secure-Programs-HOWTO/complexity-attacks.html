These attacks exploit the difference between <SPAN

behavior versus worst-case behavior; they intentionally send data that
causes an algorithm to consistently display worst-case behavior.
For examples, hash tables usually have O(1) performance for all operations,
but in many implementations an attacker can
construct input so a large number of <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>&#8220;hash collisions&#8221;</SPAN
> occur.
Other common algorithms that can be attacked include sorting
routines (e.g., quicksort&#8217;s worst case is O(n^2) instead of O(n log n))
and regular expression implementations.
Many higher-level capabilities are built on these basic algorithms
(e.g., many searches use hash tables).
More information about this attack is available in
Crosby and Wallach&#8217;s paper on the subject [Crosby 2003].

attacks in <A

>There are several solutions.
One approach is to choose
algorithms with the best worst-case behavior, not just the
best average-case behavior;
many real-time algorithms are specially designed to have the best
worst-case behavior, so search for those versions.
Crosby and Wallach propose a <SPAN

hash function
that avoids this problem.
Although I&#8217;ve seen no proof that they'd work, trivially keyed
hashes (where what is to be hashed is first passed
through a random local key) should be effective, and cryptographically
keyed hashes should be very effective - just make sure the attacker
can&#8217;t determine the key.
Judy trees may be an effective alternative to b-trees.</P
