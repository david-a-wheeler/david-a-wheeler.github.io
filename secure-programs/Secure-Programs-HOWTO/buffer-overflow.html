>Programs often use memory buffers to capture input and process data.
In some cases (particularly in C or C++ programs)
it may be possible to perform an operation,
but either read from or write to a memory location
that is outside of the intended boundary of the buffer.
In many cases this can lead to an extremely serious
security vulnerability.
This is such a common problem that it has a CWE identifier,
<A
HREF="http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/119.html"
TARGET="_top"
>CWE-119</A
>.
Exceeding buffer bounds is a problem with a program&#8217;s internal
implementation, but it&#8217;s such a common and serious problem that
I&#8217;ve placed this information in its own chapter.</P
><P
>There are many variations of a failure to restrict operations to
buffer bounds.
A subcategory of exceeding buffer bounds is
a <EM
>buffer overflow</EM
>.
The term buffer overflow has a number of varying definitions.
For our purposes,
a buffer overflow occurs if
a program attempts to write more data in a buffer than it can hold
or write into a memory area outside the boundaries of the buffer.
A particularly common situation is writing character data beyond the
end of a buffer (through copying or generation).
A buffer overflow can occur when reading input from the user into a buffer,
but it can also occur during other kinds of processing in a program.
Buffer overflows are also called <EM
>buffer overruns</EM
>.
This subcategory is such a common problem that it has its own
CWE identifier,
<A
HREF="http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/120.html"
TARGET="_top"
>CWE-120</A
>.</P
><P
>Buffer overflows are an extremely common and dangerous security flaw,
and in many cases a buffer overlow can lead immediately to an attacker
having complete control over the vulnerable program.
To give you an idea of how important this subject is,
at the CERT, 9 of 13 advisories in 1998 and at least half of
the 1999 advisories involved buffer overflows.
An informal 1999 survey on Bugtraq found that approximately 2/3 of the
respondents felt that buffer overflows were the leading cause of
system security vulnerability (the remaining respondents identified
<SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>&#8220;mis-configuration&#8221;</SPAN
> as the leading cause) [Cowan 1999].
This is an old, well-known problem, yet it continues to resurface
[McGraw 2000].</P
><P
>Attacks that exploit a buffer overflow vulnerability
are often named depending on where the buffer is, e.g.,
a <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>&#8220;stack smashing&#8221;</SPAN
> attack attacks a buffer on the stack,
while a
<SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>&#8220;heap smashing&#8221;</SPAN
> attack attacks a buffer on the heap
(memory that is allocated by operators such as
malloc and new).
More details can be found from Aleph1 [1996], Mudge [1995], LSD [2001],
or the Nathan P. Smith&#8217;s

>Allowing attackers to read data beyond a buffer boundary can also result
in vulnerabilities, and this weakness has its own identifier
(<A
HREF="http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/125.html"
TARGET="_top"
>CWE-125</A
>).
For example, the
<A
HREF="http://www.dwheeler.com/essays/heartbleed.html"
TARGET="_top"
>Heartbleed</A
>
vulnerability was this kind of weakness.
The Heartbleed vulnerability in OpenSSL allowed attackers to
extract critically-important data such as private keys, and then use them
(e.g., so they could impersonate trusted sites).</P

>Most high-level programming languages are essentially
immune to exceeding buffer boundaries, either
because they automatically resize arrays (this applies to most
languages such as Perl), or because they normally
detect and prevent buffer overflows (e.g., Ada95).
However, the C language provides no protection against
such problems, and C++ can be easily used in ways to cause this problem too.
Assembly language and Forth also provide no protection, and some languages
that normally include such protection (e.g., C#, Ada, and Pascal) can have
this protection disabled (for performance reasons).
Even if most of your program is written in another language,
many library routines are written in C or C++,
as well as <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>&#8220;glue&#8221;</SPAN
> code to
call them, so other languages often don&#8217;t provide as complete a protection
from buffer overflows as you'd like.</P
