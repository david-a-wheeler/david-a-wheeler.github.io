>Practically all programs depend on libraries to execute.
In most modern Unix-like systems, including Linux,
programs are by default compiled to use <EM
>dynamically linked libraries</EM
>
(DLLs).
That way, you can update a library and all the programs using that library
will use the new (hopefully improved) version if they can.</P
><P
>Dynamically linked libraries are typically placed in one a few special
directories. The usual directories include
<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/lib</TT
>, <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/usr/lib</TT
>, <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/lib/security</TT
>
for PAM modules, 
<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/usr/X11R6/lib</TT
> for X-windows, and <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/usr/local/lib</TT
>.
You should use these standard conventions in your programs, in particular,
except during debugging you shouldn&#8217;t use value computed from the
current directory as a source for dynamically linked libraries (an
attacker may be able to add their own choice <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>&#8220;library&#8221;</SPAN
> values).</P
><P
>There are special conventions for naming libraries and having symbolic
links for them, with the result that you can update libraries and still
support programs that want to use old, non-backward-compatible versions
of those libraries.
There are also ways to override specific libraries or even just
specific functions in a library when executing a particular program.
This is a real advantage of Unix-like systems over
Windows-like systems; I believe Unix-like systems have a much better system
for handling library updates, one reason that Unix and Linux systems are reputed
to be more stable than Windows-based systems.</P
><P
>On GNU glibc-based systems, including all Linux systems,
the list of directories automatically searched during program start-up is
stored in the file /etc/ld.so.conf.
Many Red Hat-derived distributions don&#8217;t normally
include <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/usr/local/lib</TT
>
in the file <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/etc/ld.so.conf</TT
>.
I consider this a bug, and adding <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/usr/local/lib</TT
> to
<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/etc/ld.so.conf</TT
>
is a common <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>&#8220;fix&#8221;</SPAN
> required to run many programs on Red Hat-derived systems.
If you want to just override a few functions in a library, but keep the
rest of the library, you can enter the names of overriding libraries
(.o files) in <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/etc/ld.so.preload</TT
>;
these <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>&#8220;preloading&#8221;</SPAN
> libraries will take precedence over the standard set.
This preloading file is typically used for emergency patches;
a distribution usually won&#8217;t include such a file when delivered.
Searching all of these directories at program start-up would be too
time-consuming, so a caching arrangement is actually used.
The program ldconfig(8) by default reads in the file /etc/ld.so.conf,
sets up the appropriate symbolic links in the dynamic link directories
(so they&#8217;ll follow the standard conventions),
and then writes a cache to /etc/ld.so.cache that&#8217;s then used by other
programs.
So, ldconfig has to be run whenever a DLL is added, when a DLL is removed,
or when the set of DLL directories changes; running ldconfig is often
one of the steps performed by package managers
when installing a library.
On start-up, then, a program uses the dynamic loader to
read the file /etc/ld.so.cache and then load the libraries it needs.</P
><P
>Various environment variables can control this process, and in fact
there are environment variables that permit you to
override this process (so, for example, you can temporarily
substitute a different library for this particular execution).
In Linux,
the environment variable
LD_LIBRARY_PATH is a colon-separated set of directories where libraries
are searched for first, before the standard set of directories;
this is useful when debugging a new library or using a nonstandard
library for special purposes, but be sure you trust those who can
control those directories.
The variable LD_PRELOAD lists object files with functions that override
the standard set, just as /etc/ld.so.preload does.
The variable LD_DEBUG, displays debugging information; if set
to <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>&#8220;all&#8221;</SPAN
>, voluminous information about the dynamic linking process
is displayed while it&#8217;s occurring.</P
><P
>Permitting user control over dynamically linked libraries
would be disastrous for setuid/setgid programs if special measures
weren&#8217;t taken.
Therefore, in the GNU glibc implementation, if the program is setuid or setgid
these variables (and other similar variables) are ignored or greatly
limited in what they can do.
The GNU glibc library determines if a program is setuid or setgid
by checking the program&#8217;s credentials;
if the UID and EUID differ, or the GID and the EGID differ, the
library presumes the program is setuid/setgid (or descended from one)
and therefore greatly limits its abilities to control linking.
If you load the GNU glibc libraries, you can see this; see especially
the files elf/rtld.c and sysdeps/generic/dl-sysdep.c.
This means that if you cause the UID and GID to equal the EUID and EGID,
and then call a program, these variables will have full effect.
Other Unix-like systems handle the situation differently but for the
same reason: a setuid/setgid program should not be unduly affected
by the environment variables set.
Note that graphical user interface toolkits generally do permit
user control over dynamically linked libraries, because
executables that directly invoke graphical user inteface toolkits
should never, ever, be setuid (or have other special privileges) at all.
