>If you&#8217;re developing secure programs using Java,
frankly your first step (after learning Java)
is to read the two primary texts for Java security, namely
Gong [1999]
and
McGraw [1999] (for the latter, look particularly at section 7.1).
You should also look at Sun&#8217;s posted security code guidelines at
<A
HREF="http://java.sun.com/security/seccodeguide.html"
TARGET="_top"
>http://java.sun.com/security/seccodeguide.html</A

there&#8217;s a nice
<A

A set of slides describing Java&#8217;s security model are freely available at
<A

>http://www.dwheeler.com/javasec</A
>.
You can also see McGraw [1998].</P
><P
>Obviously, a great deal depends on the kind of application you&#8217;re developing.
Java code intended for use on the client side has a completely different
environment (and trust model) than code on a server side.
The general principles apply, of course; for example, you must
check and filter any input from an untrusted source.
However, in Java there are some <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>&#8220;hidden&#8221;</SPAN
> inputs or potential inputs that you
need to be wary of, as discussed below.
Johnathan Nightingale [2000] made an interesting statement
summarizing many of the issues in Java programming:

These non-private methods must protect themselves, because they may

>The JVM may not actually enforce the accessibility modifiers

My thanks to John Steven (Cigital Inc.), who pointed this out
on the <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>&#8220;Secure Programming&#8221;</SPAN
> mailing list on November 7, 2000.
The issue is that it all depends on what class loader
the class requesting the access was loaded with.
If the class was loaded with a trusted class loader (including the null/
primordial class loader),
the access check returns "TRUE" (allowing access).
For example, this works
(at least with Sun&#8217;s 1.2.2 VM ; it might not work with
other implementations):
<P

></LI
></OL
></P
><P
>However, the situation is different with applets.
If you convert A to an applet and run it as an applet
(e.g., with appletviewer or browser), its class loader is no
longer a trusted (or null) class loader.
Thus, the code will throw
java.lang.IllegalAccessError, with the message that
you&#8217;re trying to access a field V.secret from class A.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>Avoid using static field variables. Such variables are attached to the
class (not class instances), and classes can be located by any other class.
As a result, static field variables can be found by any other class, making
them much more difficult to secure.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>Never return a mutable object to potentially malicious code
(since the code may decide to change it).
Note that arrays are mutable (even if the array contents aren&#8217;t),
so don&#8217;t return a reference to an internal array with sensitive data.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>Never store user given mutable objects (including arrays of objects)
directly.
Otherwise, the user could hand the object to the secure code, let the
secure code <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>&#8220;check&#8221;</SPAN
> the object, and change the data while the secure code
was trying to use the data.
Clone arrays before saving them internally, and be careful here
(e.g., beware of user-written cloning routines).</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>Don&#8217;t depend on initialization.
There are several ways to allocate uninitialized objects.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>Make everything final, unless there&#8217;s a good reason not to.
If a class or method is non-final, an attacker could try to extend it
in a dangerous and unforeseen way.
Note that this causes a loss of extensibility, in exchange for security.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>Don&#8217;t depend on package scope for security.
A few classes, such as java.lang, are closed by default, and some
Java Virtual Machines (JVMs) let you close off other packages.
Otherwise, Java classes are not closed.
Thus, an attacker could introduce a new class inside your package,
and use this new class to access the things you thought you were protecting.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>Don&#8217;t use inner classes.
When inner classes are translated into byte codes, the inner class
is translated into a class accesible to any class in the package.
Even worse, the enclosing class&#8217;s private fields silently
become non-private to permit access by the inner class!</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>Minimize privileges.
Where possible, don&#8217;t require any special permissions at all.
McGraw goes further and recommends not signing any code; I say
go ahead and sign the code (so users can decide to
<SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>&#8220;run only signed code by this list of senders&#8221;</SPAN
>),
but try to write the program
so that it needs nothing more than the sandbox set of privileges.
If you must have more privileges, audit that code especially hard.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>If you must sign your code, put it all in one archive file.
Here it&#8217;s best to quote McGraw [1999]:
<A
NAME="AEN2715"
></A
><BLOCKQUOTE
CLASS="BLOCKQUOTE"
><P
>The goal of this rule is to prevent
an attacker from carrying out a mix-and-match
attack in which the attacker constructs a new applet
or library that links some of your signed classes together
with malicious classes, or links together signed classes that you
never meant to be used together.
By signing a group of classes together, you make this attack more difficult.
Existing code-signing systems do an inadequate job of
preventing mix-and-match attacks, so this rule cannot
prevent such attacks completely. But using a single archive can&#8217;t hurt.</P
></BLOCKQUOTE
></P
></LI
><LI
><P
>Make your classes uncloneable.
Java&#8217;s object-cloning mechanism allows an attacker to
instantiate a class without running any of its constructors.
To make your class uncloneable, just define the following method
in each of your classes:
<TABLE
BORDER="0"
BGCOLOR="#E0E0E0"
WIDTH="90%"
><TR
><TD
><FONT
COLOR="#000000"
><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>public final Object clone() throws java.lang.CloneNotSupportedException {
   throw new java.lang.CloneNotSupportedException();
   }</PRE
></FONT
></TD
></TR
></TABLE
></P
><P
>If you really need to make your class cloneable, then there are some
protective measures you can take to prevent attackers from redefining
your clone method.
If you&#8217;re defining your own clone method, just make it final.
If you&#8217;re not, you can at least prevent the clone method from 
being maliciously overridden by adding the following:
<TABLE
BORDER="0"
BGCOLOR="#E0E0E0"
WIDTH="90%"
><TR
><TD
><FONT
COLOR="#000000"
><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>public final void clone() throws java.lang.CloneNotSupportedException {
  super.clone();
  }</PRE
></FONT
></TD
></TR
></TABLE
></P
></LI
><LI
><P
>Make your classes unserializeable.
Serialization allows attackers to view the internal state of your objects,
even private portions.
To prevent this, add this method to your classes:
<TABLE
BORDER="0"
BGCOLOR="#E0E0E0"
WIDTH="90%"
><TR
><TD
><FONT
COLOR="#000000"
><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>private final void writeObject(ObjectOutputStream out)
  throws java.io.IOException {
     throw new java.io.IOException("Object cannot be serialized");
  }</PRE
></FONT
></TD
></TR
></TABLE
></P
><P
>Even in cases where serialization is okay, be sure to use
the transient keyword for the fields
that contain direct handles to system resources and
that contain information relative to an address space. 
Otherwise, deserializing the class may permit improper access.
You may also want to identify sensitive information as transient.</P
><P
>If you define your own serializing method for a class,
it should not pass an internal array to any DataInput/DataOuput
method that takes an array.
The rationale: All DataInput/DataOutput methods can be overridden.
If a Serializable class passes a private array directly to a DataOutput(write(byte [] b)) method, then an attacker
could subclass ObjectOutputStream and override the write(byte [] b)
method to enable him to access and modify the private array. 
Note that the default serialization does not expose private
byte array fields to DataInput/DataOutput byte array methods. </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>Make your classes undeserializeable.
Even if your class is not serializeable, it may still be deserializeable.
An attacker can create a sequence of bytes that happens
to deserialize to an instance of your class with values of the
attacker&#8217;s choosing.
In other words, deserialization is a kind of public constructor, allowing
an attacker to choose the object&#8217;s state - clearly a dangerous operation!
To prevent this, add this method to your classes:
<TABLE
BORDER="0"
BGCOLOR="#E0E0E0"
WIDTH="90%"
><TR
><TD
><FONT
COLOR="#000000"
><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>private final void readObject(ObjectInputStream in)
  throws java.io.IOException {
    throw new java.io.IOException("Class cannot be deserialized");
  }</PRE
></FONT
></TD
></TR
></TABLE
></P
></LI
><LI
><P
>Don&#8217;t compare classes by name.
After all, attackers can define classes with identical names, and if
you&#8217;re not careful you can cause confusion by granting these classes
undesirable privileges.
Thus, here&#8217;s an example of the <EM
>wrong</EM
> way
to determine if an object has a given class:
<TABLE
BORDER="0"
BGCOLOR="#E0E0E0"
WIDTH="90%"
><TR
><TD
><FONT
COLOR="#000000"
><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>  if (obj.getClass().getName().equals("Foo")) {</PRE
></FONT
></TD
></TR
></TABLE
></P
><P
>If you need to determine if two objects have exactly the
same class, instead
use getClass() on both sides and compare using the == operator, 
Thus, you should use this form:
<TABLE
BORDER="0"
BGCOLOR="#E0E0E0"
WIDTH="90%"
><TR
><TD
><FONT
COLOR="#000000"
><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>  if (a.getClass() == b.getClass()) {</PRE
></FONT
></TD
></TR
></TABLE
>
If you truly need to determine if an object has a given classname, you
need to be pedantic and be sure to use the current namespace
(of the current class&#8217;s ClassLoader).
Thus, you&#8217;ll need to use this format:
<TABLE
BORDER="0"
BGCOLOR="#E0E0E0"
WIDTH="90%"
><TR
><TD
><FONT
COLOR="#000000"
><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>  if (obj.getClass() == this.getClassLoader().loadClass("Foo")) {</PRE
></FONT
></TD
></TR
></TABLE
></P
><P
>This guideline is from McGraw and Felten, and it&#8217;s a good guideline.
I&#8217;ll add that, where possible, it&#8217;s often a good idea to avoid comparing
class values anyway.
It&#8217;s often better to try to design class methods and interfaces so you
don&#8217;t need to do this at all.
However, this isn&#8217;t always practical, so it&#8217;s important to know these tricks.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>Don&#8217;t store secrets (cryptographic keys, passwords, or
algorithm) in the code or data.
Hostile JVMs can quickly view this data.
Code obfuscation doesn&#8217;t really hide the code from serious attackers.</P
