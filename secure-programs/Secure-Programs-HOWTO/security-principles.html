><P
>There are many general security principles which you should be
familiar with; one good place for general information on information security
is the Information Assurance Technical Framework (IATF) [NSA 2000].
NIST has identified high-level <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>&#8220;generally accepted principles and practices&#8221;</SPAN
>
[Swanson 1996].
You could also look at a general textbook on computer security, such as
[Pfleeger 1997].
NIST Special Publication 800-27 describes a number of good engineering
principles (although, since they&#8217;re abstract, they&#8217;re insufficient for
actually building secure programs - hence this book);
you can get a copy at
<A
HREF="http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistpubs/800-27/sp800-27.pdf"
TARGET="_top"
>http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistpubs/800-27/sp800-27.pdf</A
>.
A few security principles are summarized here.</P
><P
>Often computer security objectives (or goals) are described in terms of three
overall objectives:

<P
></P
><UL
><LI
><P
><EM
>Confidentiality</EM
> (also known as secrecy), meaning that the
computing system&#8217;s assets can be read only by authorized parties.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
><EM
>Integrity</EM
>, meaning that the assets can only be modified or deleted by
authorized parties in authorized ways.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
><EM
>Availability</EM
>,
meaning that the assets are accessible to the authorized 
parties in a timely manner (as determined by the systems requirements).
The failure to meet this goal is called a denial of service.</P
></LI
></UL
>


Some people define additional major security objectives, while others lump
those additional goals as special cases of these three.
For example, some separately
identify non-repudiation as an objective; this is
the ability to <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>&#8220;prove&#8221;</SPAN
> that a sender sent or receiver received a message
(or both), even if the sender or receiver wishes to deny it later.
Privacy is sometimes addressed separately from confidentiality;
some define this as protecting the confidentiality of a
<EM
>user</EM
> (e.g., their identity) instead of the data.
Most objectives require identification and authentication, which is
sometimes listed as a separate objective.
Often auditing (also called accountability) is identified
as a desirable security objective.
Sometimes <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>&#8220;access control&#8221;</SPAN
>  and <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>&#8220;authenticity&#8221;</SPAN
> are listed separately
as well.
For example,
The U.S. Department of Defense (DoD), in DoD directive 3600.1
defines <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>&#8220;information assurance&#8221;</SPAN
> as
<SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>&#8220;information operations (IO) that protect and defend
information and information systems by ensuring
their availability, integrity, authentication,
confidentiality, and nonrepudiation.
This includes providing for restoration of information systems by
incorporating protection, detection, and reaction capabilities.&#8221;</SPAN
></P
><P
>In any case, it is important to identify your program&#8217;s overall
security objectives, no matter how you group them together,
so that you&#8217;ll know when you&#8217;ve met them.</P
><P
>Sometimes these objectives are a response to a known set of threats,
and sometimes some of these objectives are required by law.
For example, for U.S. banks and other financial institutions,
there&#8217;s a new privacy law called the <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>&#8220;Gramm-Leach-Bliley&#8221;</SPAN
> (GLB) Act.
This law mandates disclosure of personal information shared and
means of securing that data, requires disclosure of personal information
that will be shared with third parties, and directs institutions to
give customers a chance to opt out of data sharing.

><P
>There is sometimes conflict between security and some other general
system/software engineering principles.
Security can sometimes interfere with <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>&#8220;ease of use&#8221;</SPAN
>, for example,
installing a secure configuration may take more effort than a
<SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>&#8220;trivial&#8221;</SPAN
> installation that works but is insecure.
Often, this apparent conflict can be resolved, for example, by re-thinking
a problem it&#8217;s often possible to make a secure system also easy to use.
There&#8217;s also sometimes a conflict between security and abstraction
(information hiding);
for example, some high-level library routines may be implemented securely
or not, but their specifications won&#8217;t tell you.
In the end, if your application must be secure, you must do things yourself
if you can&#8217;t be sure otherwise - yes, the library should be fixed, but
it&#8217;s your users who will be hurt by your poor choice of library routines.</P
><P
>A good general security principle is <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>&#8220;defense in depth&#8221;</SPAN
>;
you should have numerous defense mechanisms (<SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>&#8220;layers&#8221;</SPAN
>) in place,
designed so that an attacker has to defeat multiple mechanisms to
perform a successful attack.</P
