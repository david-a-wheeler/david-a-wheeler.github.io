The pointer value that means <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>&#8220;does not point anywhere&#8221;</SPAN
> is called NULL;
C compilers will convert the integer 0 to the value NULL in most circumstances
where a pointer is needed,
but note that nothing in the C standard requires that NULL actually
be implemented by a series of all-zero bits.
C and C++ treat the character <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>&#8220;\0&#8221;</SPAN
> (ASCII 0)
specially, and this value
is referred to as NIL in this book (this is usually called <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>&#8220;NUL&#8221;</SPAN
>,
but <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>&#8220;NUL&#8221;</SPAN
> and <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>&#8220;NULL&#8221;</SPAN
> sound identical).
Function and method names always use the correct case, even if that means
that some sentences must begin with a lower case letter.
I use the term <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>&#8220;Unix-like&#8221;</SPAN
> to mean Unix, Linux, or other systems whose
underlying models are very similar to Unix;
I can&#8217;t say POSIX, because there are systems such as Windows 2000 that
implement portions of POSIX yet have vastly different security models.</P

and not a <SPAN

Some journalists mistakenly use the word <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>&#8220;hacker&#8221;</SPAN
> instead of <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>&#8220;attacker&#8221;</SPAN
>;
this book avoids this misuse, because many
Linux and Unix developers refer to themselves as <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>&#8220;hackers&#8221;</SPAN
>
in the traditional non-evil sense of the term.
To many Linux and Unix developers, the term <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>&#8220;hacker&#8221;</SPAN
> continues
to mean simply an expert or enthusiast, particularly regarding computers.
It is true that some hackers commit malicious or intrusive actions,
but many other hackers do not,
and it&#8217;s unfair to claim that all hackers perform malicious activities.
Many other glossaries and books note that not all hackers are attackers.
For example,
the Industry Advisory Council&#8217;s Information Assurance (IA)
Special Interest Group (SIG)&#8217;s

TARGET="_top"
>Information Assurance Glossary</A
> defines hacker as
<SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>&#8220;A person who delights in having an intimate understanding of the
internal workings of computers and computer networks.
The term is misused in a negative context where <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>&#8216;cracker&#8217;</SPAN
>
should be used.&#8221;</SPAN

CLASS="QUOTE"
>&#8220;A person who enjoys exploring the details of programmable systems

>;
it notes although some people use the term to mean
<SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>&#8220;A malicious meddler who tries to discover sensitive information
by poking around&#8221;</SPAN
>,
it also states that this definition is deprecated and
that the correct term for this sense
is <SPAN

>This book uses the <EM
>logical</EM
> quotation system,
not the misleading <EM
>typesetters&#8217;</EM
> quotation system.
This means that quoted information
does <EM
>not</EM
>
include any trailing punctuation if the punctuation
is not part of the material being quoted.
The typesetters&#8217; quotation system
causes extraneous characters to be placed inside the quotes;
this has no affect in poetry but
is a serious problem when accuracy is important.
The typesetters&#8217; quotation system
often falsifies quotes (since it includes punctuation not in the quote)
and can be disastrously erroneous in code or computer commands.
The logical quotation system is widely used in a variety of publications,
including

and the Linguistic Society of America.
This book uses standard American (not British) spelling.</P
