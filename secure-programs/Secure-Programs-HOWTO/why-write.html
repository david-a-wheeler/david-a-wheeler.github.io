Here&#8217;s my answer:
Over the last several years I&#8217;ve noticed that many application developers
seem to keep falling into the same security pitfalls, again and again.
Auditors were slowly catching problems, but it would have been better
if the problems weren&#8217;t put into the code in the first place.
I believe that part of the problem was that there wasn&#8217;t a single, obvious
place where developers could go and get information on how to avoid
known pitfalls.
The information was publicly available, but it was often hard to find,
out-of-date, incomplete, or had other problems.
Most such information didn&#8217;t particularly discuss Linux at all, even
though it was becoming widely used!
That leads up to the answer: I developed this book
in the hope that future software developers won&#8217;t repeat
past mistakes, resulting in more secure systems.

There are several answers:

>Much of this information was scattered about; placing 
the critical information in one organized document
makes it easier to use.</P

>Much of the available information emphasizes portable constructs
(constructs that work on all Unix-like systems), and
failed to discuss Linux at all.
It&#8217;s often best to avoid Linux-unique abilities for portability&#8217;s sake,
but sometimes the Linux-unique abilities can really aid security.
Even if non-Linux portability is desired, you may want to support
the Linux-unique abilities when running on Linux.
And, by emphasizing Linux, I can include references to information that
is helpful to someone targeting Linux that is not necessarily true for
others.</P
