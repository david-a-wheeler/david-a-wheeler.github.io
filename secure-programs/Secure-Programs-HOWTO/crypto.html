Where possible, use cryptographic techniques to authenticate information and
keep the information private

>Cryptographic protocols and algorithms are difficult to get right,
so do not create your own.
Instead, where you can, use protocols and algorithms that are
widely-used, heavily analyzed, and accepted as secure.
When you must create anything, give the approach wide public review and
make sure that professional security analysts examine it for problems.
In particular, do not create your own encryption algorithms unless you are
an expert in cryptology, know what you&#8217;re doing, and plan to spend
years in professional review of the algorithm.
Creating encryption algorithms (that are any good) is a task for experts only.</P

For RSA keys, 512 bits is too small for use.
There is increasing evidence that
1024 bits for RSA keys is not enough either;
Bernstein has suggested techniques that simplify brute-forcing RSA, and
other work based on it
(such as Shamir and Tromer&#8217;s "Factoring Large Numbers with the TWIRL device")
now suggests that 1024 bit keys can be broken in a year
by a $10 Million device.
You may want to
make 2048 bits the minimum for RSA if you really want a secure system.

></H2
><P
>When you need a security protocol, try to use standard-conforming protocols
such as IPSec, SSL (soon to be TLS), SSH, S/MIME, OpenPGP/GnuPG/PGP,
and Kerberos.
Each has advantages and disadvantages;
many of them overlap somewhat in functionality, but each tends to be
used in different areas:

<P
></P
><UL
><LI
><P
>Internet Protocol Security (IPSec).
IPSec provides encryption and/or authentication at the IP packet level.
However, IPSec is often used in a way that
only guarantees authenticity of two
communicating hosts, not of the users.
As a practical matter, IPSec usually requires low-level support
from the operating system (which not all implement) and
an additional keyring server that must be configured.
Since IPSec can be used as a "tunnel" to secure packets belonging to
multiple users and multiple hosts, it is especially useful for
building a Virtual Private Network (VPN) and connecting a remote machine.
As of this time, it is much less often used to secure communication
from individual clients to servers.
The new version of the Internet Protocol, IPv6, comes with
IPSec <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>&#8220;built in,&#8221;</SPAN
> but IPSec also works with the more common IPv4 protocol.
Note that if you use IPSec, don&#8217;t use the encryption mode without the
authentication, because the authentication also acts as
integrity protection.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>Secure Socket Layer (SSL) / TLS.
SSL/TLS works over TCP and tunnels other protocols using TCP, adding
encryption, authentication of the server, and optional authentication
of the client (but authenticating clients using SSL/TLS requires
that clients have configured X.509 client certificates, something
rarely done).
SSL version 3 is widely used; TLS is a later adjustment to SSL that
strengthens its security and improves its flexibility.
Currently there is a slow transition going on from SSLv3 to TLS, aided
because implementations can easily try to use TLS and then back off to SSLv3
without user intervention.
Unfortunately, a few bad SSLv3 implementations cause problems with the
backoff, so you may need a preferences setting to allow users to skip
using TLS if necessary.
Don&#8217;t use SSL version 2, it has some serious security weaknesses.</P
><P
>SSL/TLS is the primary method for protecting http (web) transactions.
Any time you use an "https://" URL, you&#8217;re using SSL/TLS.
Other protocols that often use SSL/TLS include POP3 and IMAP.
SSL/TLS usually use a separate TCP/IP port
number from the unsecured port, which the IETF is a little unhappy about
(because it consumes twice as many ports; there are solutions to this).
SSL is relatively easy to use in programs, because
most library implementations allow programmers to use operations
similar to the operations on standard sockets like
SSL_connect(), SSL_write(), SSL_read(), etc.
A widely used OSS/FS implementation of SSL (as well as other capabilities)
is OpenSSL, available at
<A

>.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>OpenPGP and S/MIME.
There are two competing, essentially incompatible standards for
securing email: OpenPGP and S/MIME.
OpenPHP is based on the PGP application; an OSS/FS implementation is
GNU Privacy Guard from
<A
HREF="http://www.gnupg.org"
TARGET="_top"
>http://www.gnupg.org</A
>.
Currently, their certificates are often not interchangeable;
work is ongoing to repair this.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>SSH.
SSH is the primary method of securing <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>&#8220;remote terminals&#8221;</SPAN
> over an 
internet, and it also includes methods for
tunelling X Windows sessions.
However, it&#8217;s been extended to support single sign-on and
general secure tunelling for TCP streams, so it&#8217;s often
used for securing other data streams too (such as CVS accesses).
The most popular implementation of SSH is OpenSSH
<A
HREF="http://www.openssh.com"
TARGET="_top"
>http://www.openssh.com</A
>,
which is OSS/FS.
Typical uses of SSH allows the client to authenticate that the
server is truly the server, and
then the user enters a password to authenticate the user
(the password is encrypted and sent to the other system for verification).
Current versions of SSH can store private keys, allowing users to not
enter the password each time.
To prevent man-in-the-middle attacks, SSH records keying information
about servers it talks to; that means that typical use of
SSH is vulnerable to a man-in-the-middle attack during the
very first connection, but it can detect problems afterwards.
In contrast, SSL generally uses a certificate authority, which eliminates
the first connection problem but requires special setup (and payment!) to
the certificate authority.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>Kerberos.
Kerberos is a protocol for single sign-on and authenticating users
against a central authentication and key distribution server. Kerberos
works by giving authenticated users "tickets", granting them access to
various services on the network.
When clients then contact servers, the servers can verify the tickets.
Kerberos is a primary method for securing and supporting authentication
on a LAN, and for establishing shared secrets (thus, it needs to be
used with other algorithms for the actual protection of communication).
Note that to use Kerberos, both the client and server have to include
code to use it, and since not everyone has a Kerberos setup, this has
to be optional - complicating the use of Kerberos in some programs.
However, Kerberos is widely used.</P

I would recommend using the
new Advanced Encryption Standard (AES), also known as Rijndahl --
a number of cryptographers have analyzed it and not found any serious weakness
in it, and I believe it has been through enough analysis
to be trustworthy now.
In August 2002 researchers Fuller and Millar
discovered a mathematical property of the cipher that,
while not an attack, might be exploitable and turned into an attack
(the approach may actually has serious consequences for some other
algorithms, too).
However, heavy-duty worldwide analysis has yet to
provide serious evidence that AES is actually vulnerable
(see [Landau 2004] for more technical information on Rijndael).
It&#8217;s always worth staying tuned for future work, of course.
A good alternative to AES is the Serpent algorithm, which is slightly slower
but is very resistant to attack.
For many applications triple-DES is a very good encryption algorithm; it
has a reasonably lengthy key (112 bits), no patent issues, and
a very long history of withstanding attacks (it&#8217;s withstood attacks far
longer than any other encryption algorithm with reasonable key length in the
public literature, so it&#8217;s probably the safest publicly-available
symmetric encryption algorithm when properly implemented).
However, triple-DES is very slow when implemented in software, so
triple-DES can be considered <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>&#8220;safest but slowest.&#8221;</SPAN
>
Twofish appears to be a good encryption algorithm, but there are some
lingering questions - Sean Murphy and Fauzan Mirza showed that Twofish
has properties that cause many academics to be concerned (though as of yet
no one has managed to exploit these properties).
MARS is highly resistent to <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>&#8220;new and novel&#8221;</SPAN
> attacks, but it&#8217;s more complex
and is impractical on small-ability smartcards.
For the moment I would avoid Twofish - it&#8217;s quite likely that this will never
be exploitable, but it&#8217;s hard to be sure and there are alternative
algorithms which don&#8217;t have these concerns.
Don&#8217;t use IDEA - it&#8217;s subject to U.S. and European patents.
Don&#8217;t use stupid algorithms such as XOR with a constant or constant string,
the ROT (rotation)
scheme, a Vinegere ciphers, and so on - these can be trivially broken
with today&#8217;s computers.
Don&#8217;t use <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>&#8220;double DES&#8221;</SPAN
> (using DES twice) - that&#8217;s subject to a

CLASS="QUOTE"

Your protocol should support multiple encryption algorithms, anyway;
that way, when an encryption algorithm is broken,
users can switch to another one.</P
><P
>For symmetric-key encryption (e.g., for bulk encryption), don&#8217;t use a
key length less than 90 bits if you want the information
to stay secret through 2016
(add another bit for every additional 18 months of security) [Blaze 1996].
For encrypting worthless data, the old DES algorithm has some value,
but with modern hardware it&#8217;s too easy to break DES&#8217;s 56-bit key using
brute force.
If you&#8217;re using DES, don&#8217;t just use the ASCII text key as the key -
parity is in the least (not most) significant bit, so most DES algorithms
will encrypt using a key value well-known to adversaries;
instead, create a hash of the key and set the parity bits correctly
(and pay attention to error reports from your encryption routine).
So-called <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>&#8220;exportable&#8221;</SPAN
> encryption algorithms only have effective key lengths
of 40 bits, and are essentially worthless;
in 1996 an attacker could spend $10,000 to break such keys in twelve minutes
or use idle computer time to break them in a few days,
with the time-to-break halving every 18 months in either case.</P

In nearly all cases, use CBC, and do <EM

The IV doesn&#8217;t need to be secret, but it does need to be unpredictable by

Don&#8217;t reuse IV&#8217;s across sessions - use a new IV each time you start a session.</P
><P
>There are a number of different streaming encryption algorithms, but
many of them have patent restrictions.
I know of no patent or technical issues with WAKE.
RC4 was a trade secret of RSA Data Security Inc; it&#8217;s been leaked since,
and I know of no real legal impediment to its use, but RSA Data
Security has often threatened
court action against users of it (it&#8217;s not at all clear what RSA Data
Security could do,
but no doubt they could tie up users in worthless court cases).
If you use RC4, use it as intended - in particular, always discard the
first 256 bytes it generates, or you&#8217;ll be vulnerable to attack.
SEAL is patented by IBM - so don&#8217;t use it.
SOBER is patented; the patent owner has claimed that it will allow many
uses for free if permission is requested, but this creates an impediment for
later use.
Even more interestingly, block encryption algorithms can be used in modes that
turn them into stream ciphers, and users who want stream ciphers should
consider this approach (you&#8217;ll be able to choose between far more
publicly-available algorithms).</P

>For public key cryptography (used, among other things, for

widely-deployed algorithms.
One of the most widely-used algorithms is RSA;
RSA&#8217;s algorithm was patented, but only in the U.S., and that patent
expired in September 2000, so RSA can be freely used.
Never decrypt or sign a raw value that an attacker gives you directly using
RSA and expose the result, because that could expose the private key
(this isn&#8217;t a problem in practice, because most protocols involve
signing a hash computed by the user - not the raw value - or don&#8217;t expose
the result).
Never decrypt or sign the exact same raw value multiple times
(the original can be exposed).
Both of these can be solved by always adding random padding
(PGP does this) - the usual approach is called
Optimal Asymmetric Encryption Padding (OAEP).</P

expired in 1997.
If you use Diffie-Hellman to create a shared secret, be sure to hash it first
(there&#8217;s an attack if you use its shared value directly).</P

>RSA, Diffie-Hellman, and El Gamal&#8217;s techniques require more bits for the
keys for equivalent security compared to typical symmetric keys;
a 1024-bit key in these systems is supposed to be roughly equivalent
to an 80-bit symmetric key.
A 512-bit RSA key is considered completely unsafe;
Nicko van Someren has demonstrated that such small RSA keys
can be factored in 6 weeks using only already-available office hardware
(never mind equipment designed for the job).
In the past, a 1024-bit RSA key was considered reasonably secure, but
recent advancements in factorization algorithms
(e.g., by D. J. Bernstein) have raised concerns that perhaps even 1024 bits
is not enough for an RSA key.
Netcraft noted back in 2012 that
both the CA/B Forum (a consortium of certificate authorities)
and NIST have recommended that RSA public keys below 2048 bits
be phased out by 2013.
Today, RSA users should be using keys that are at least 2048 bits long.</P
><P
>If you need a public key that requires far fewer bits (e.g., for
a smartcard), then you might use elliptic
curve cryptography (IEEE P1363 has some suggested curves; finding curves
is hard).
However, be careful - elliptic curve cryptography isn&#8217;t patented, but
certain speedup techniques are patented.
Elliptic curve cryptography is fast enough
that it really doesn&#8217;t need these speedups anyway for its usual use of
encrypting session / bulk encryption keys.
In general, you shouldn&#8217;t try to do bulk encryption with elliptic keys;
symmetric algorithms are much faster and are better-tested for the job.</P

That is, even if messages are encrypted and the encryption is not broken,

For example, if the presidents of two companies start exchanging many
encrypted email messages, it may suggest that the two comparies are
considering a merger.
For another example, many SSH implementations have been found to have a
weakness in exchanging passwords: observers could look at packets and

Don&#8217;t use the same key for too long - after a while, change the session key
or password so an adversary will have to start over.</P

add a fixed header, which isn&#8217;t so good, but it eliminates many
patterns in the rest of the message as well as making the result

>In a related note, if you must create your own communication
protocol, examine the problems of what&#8217;s gone on before.
Classics such as Bellovin [1989]&#8217;s review of security problems
in the TCP/IP protocol suite might help you, as well as
Bruce Schneier [1998]
and Mudge&#8217;s breaking of Microsoft&#8217;s PPTP implementation and their
follow-on work.
Again, be sure to give any new protocol widespread public review, and
reuse what you can.</P
