<p>
<img align=right src="https://dwheeler.com/dwheeler2003.jpg" alt="Picture of David A. Wheeler" width="150" height="240">
This is the main web site for my free book, the
<b><em>Secure Programming HOWTO</em></b>
(previously titled <em>Secure Programming for Linux and Unix HOWTO</em>
and
<em>Secure Programming for Linux HOWTO</em>).
This book provides a set of design and implementation
guidelines for writing secure programs.
Such programs include application programs used as viewers of remote data,
web applications (including CGI scripts),
network servers, and setuid/setgid programs.
This document includes specific guidance for a number of languages,
including C, C++, Java, Perl, Python, and Ada95.

I give this book away in the hope that future software developers
won't repeat past mistakes, resulting in more secure systems.

This document is part of the
<a href="http://tldp.org">Linux Documentation Project</a> (LDP),
and hence is also distributed in various Linux distributions.
However, note that the LDP's version or the version in a CD-ROM distribution
may not be as current as the main (master) web site at
<a href="https://dwheeler.com/secure-programs">https://dwheeler.com/secure-programs</a>.

<h1>Presentations</h1>
<p>
<a href="../secure-class/index.html">Presentations on developing
secure software, based on the book, are available</a>.
These presentations are from the graduate course I teach at
<a href="http://www.gmu.edu">George Mason University</a>
(SWE 681/ISA 681)
on the design and implementation of secure software.
Reading presentations is not the same as taking a class, but you
may find them very helpful.
<p>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a5D4d6hcEY">The video
"How to Develop Secure Applications: The BadgeApp Example"</a>
walks through the "assurance case" of the BadgeApp program.
An assurance case is simply a structured argument that explains
(in this case) why it's secure enough.
I think examples are very helpful when learning - I hope you also
find it useful.

<!--
<p>
Here are presentation slides from my one-hour version:
<ul>
<li><a href="secure-programming-handouts.pdf">Handouts, in PDF</a> or
<li><a href="secure-programming.pdf">Full slides, in PDF</a>
</ul>
I've given the presentation several places, including
FOSDEM 2002 (Belgium),
the Software Productivity Consortium (Virginia), and the
University of Baltimore (Maryland).
Note that the slides are <i>not</i> released under the same license as
the book.

<h1><a name="kudos">Kudos</a></h1>
<p>
Many people have said nice things about my book.
Here's a few:
<ul>
<li>"Android is built using the Linux kernel and being familiar with
Linux development security best practices is especially useful if you
are going to use native code. Linux security practices are beyond
the scope of this document, but one of the most popular resources
is 'Secure Programming for Linux and Unix HOWTO', available at
<a href="https://dwheeler.com/secure-programs">https://dwheeler.com/secure-programs</a> - from <a href="https://developer.android.com/training/articles/security-tips.html">"Security Tips", Android.com, retrieved 2014-02-16</a>.
<li>"Another outstanding online resource for examples of secure coding
is the "Secure Programming for Linux and UNIX HOWTO",
by David Wheeler. It's available online...
While the entire volume is strong, we liked particularly
David's discussion of making safe temporary files in C."
- <a href="http://www.securecoding.org/companion/snippets.php">Securecoding.org</a>
<li>"[I] read your secure programming how-to when in college, it's one of
the most influential books on me on how to program." - Dimitris Mistriotis
<li>"[This book is] the tome that stays permanently printed on my desk...
I've been using Sec.Progr.Howto for years now and I have to say great
work...  It's unspeakably useful to have the document there as a
reference. I don't just like the book, it's one of the top 5 reference
documents I use!  ... flawfinder and the
Secure Programming Howto were integral to patching and correcting an
in-house invoicing system for a nation wide Australian company."
- Jason Spalding, November 2008

<h1>Comments?</h1>
<p>
If you have comments, proposed improvements, or intend to translate it
to another human language,
<a href="https://dwheeler.com/contactme.html">please send email to me</a>.
I edit the SGML (DocBook DTD) file;
all the other formats are generated from this master version.
You can also see the <a href="ChangeLog">ChangeLog</a>, and users of the
SGML format may find the <a href="makefile">makefile</a> useful.
As of February 28, 2002, I've switched to the LDP's document
generation process (e.g., using HTMLDOC), which I
think generates nicer results than the tools I had been using before.
Notice that as of version 2.00, the document is in SGML using the
DocBook DTD; previous versions up through version 1.60 were in SGML
but they used the Linuxdoc DTD.
I've kept <A HREF="old/">old versions of this document</A> to help
translators deal with this transition in format.
<p>
I realize that some other articles/books have shown up since.
These include

I <I>cannot</I> guarantee that the translations accurately reflect the
original English work; I'm sorry, but I'm simply not qualified to judge that.
If you find an error in translation, please contact the translators directly.
If you find an error in the underlying content, or do not get satisfaction
when reporting errors to the translator, then contact me.
<p>
I hope to mention or link to additional translations as I learn about them.
Please contact me before translating, so that duplicate work can be avoided
(for example, perhaps multiple translators could divide the work), and
let me know when you're done.
I am very grateful to these people who have taken the time to
translate this fairly lengthy work.
<p>
<h1>Miscellaneous</h1>
I have a few little scripts and programs here that are related to
the book's material, for example,
<a href="url.pl.txt">url.pl</A> is a short script I use for testing the
complex URI validation patterns.
<p>
This document keeps getting longer than the typical HOWTO;
I may eventually split this into a ``short form'' and a ``longer form''.
I'm also thinking about how to handle publication for the ``long form'', since
I think many people will want a nice bound version of it so they can
read it easily.
<p>
When I wrote the original work there wasn't anything else out there.
In fact, this was the first book on how to develop secure programs
written for software developers.
Previous books tended to be written for security specialists (not developers),
or had high-level priniciples instead of detailed information that a
programmer could actually <i>use</i>.
Now there are lots of materials (hooray!).
<a href="http://www.iese.fraunhofer.de/lectures/peine/materialcourse/">
Dr. Holger Peine has lecture notes for a college class available on-line</a>.
<a href="https://www.securecoding.cert.org/confluence/display/sci/15392+Secure+Programming">Robert C. Seacord has his CMU lecture online</a>.

<a href="https://dwheeler.com/flawfinder">flawfinder is a
source code security scanning tool (a "static analyzer")
that reports on likely security problems in source code</a>; its
home page links to other analysis programs and papers about them.
My paper on
<a href="https://dwheeler.com/essays/scm-security.html">
Software Configuration Management (SCM) Security</a>
describes security requirements that can be useful for SCM systems.
<a href="https://dwheeler.com/essays/securing-windows.html">
Securing Microsoft Windows (for Home and Small Business Users)</a>
explains how you can get some basic security measures set up on Windows.
My paper
<a href="https://dwheeler.com/trusting-trust">Countering Trusting Trust
through Diverse Double-Compiling</a> describes a technique for countering
the "uncounterable" Trusting Trust attack; while I didn't come up with
the original idea, I developed it from an idea described in a few sentences
to a justification and demonstration that it actually works.

If you are interested high assurance software or
free-libre/open source software (FLOSS),
take a peek at my paper
<a href="https://dwheeler.com/essays/high-assurance-floss.html">
High Assurance (for Security or Safety) and
Free-Libre / Open Source Software (FLOSS)</a>, which
examines the relationship between them; in particular, it lists FLOSS
tools that can be helpful in developing higher-assurance software.
