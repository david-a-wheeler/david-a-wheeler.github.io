The Farewell Dossier

WASHINGTON--Intelligence shortcomings, as we see, have a thousand fathers;
secret intelligence triumphs are orphans. Here is the unremarked
story of "the Farewell dossier": how a C.I.A. campaign of computer
sabotage resulting in a huge explosion in Siberia - all engineered by
a mild-mannered economist named Gus Weiss - helped us win the cold war.

Weiss worked down the hall from me in the Nixon administration. In
early 1974, he wrote a report on Soviet advances in technology through
purchasing and copying that led the beleaguered president - de'tente
notwithstanding - to place restrictions on the export of computers and
software to the U.S.S.R.

Seven years later, we learned how the K.G.B. responded. I was writing a
series of hard-line columns denouncing the financial backing being given
Moscow by Germany and Britain for a major natural gas pipeline from
Siberia to Europe. That project would give control of European energy
supplies to the Communists, as well as generate $8 billion a year to
support Soviet computer and satellite research.

President Franc,ois Mitterrand of France also opposed the gas pipeline. He
took President Reagan aside at a conference in Ottawa on July 19, 1981,
to reveal that France had recruited a key K.G.B. officer in Moscow Center.

Col. Vladimir Vetrov provided what French intelligence called the Farewell
dossier. It contained documents from the K.G.B. Technology Directorate
showing how the Soviets were systematically stealing - or secretly buying
through third parties - the radar, machine tools and semiconductors
to keep the Russians nearly competitive with U.S. military-industrial
strength through the 70's. In effect, the U.S. was in an arms race
with itself.

Reagan passed this on to William J. Casey, his director of central
intelligence, now remembered only for the Iran-contra fiasco. Casey called
in Weiss, then working with Thomas C. Reed on the staff of the National
Security Council. After studying the list of hundreds of Soviet agents
and purchasers (including one cosmonaut) assigned to this penetration
in the U.S. and Japan, Weiss counseled against deportation.

Instead, according to Reed - a former Air Force secretary whose
fascinating cold war book, "At the Abyss," will be published by Random
House next month - Weiss said: "Why not help the Soviets with their
shopping? Now that we know what they want, we can help them get it." The
catch: computer chips would be designed to pass Soviet quality tests
and then to fail in operation.

In our complex disinformation scheme, deliberately flawed designs for
stealth technology and space defense sent Russian scientists down paths
that wasted time and money.

The technology topping the Soviets' wish list was for computer
control systems to automate the operation of the new trans-Siberian gas
pipeline. When we turned down their overt purchase order, the K.G.B. sent
a covert agent into a Canadian company to steal the software; tipped off
by Farewell, we added what geeks call a "Trojan Horse" to the pirated
product.

"The pipeline software that was to run the pumps, turbines and valves
was programmed to go haywire," writes Reed, "to reset pump speeds and
valve settings to produce pressures far beyond those acceptable to the
pipeline joints and welds. The result was the most monumental non-nuclear
explosion and fire ever seen from space."

Our Norad monitors feared a nuclear detonation, but satellites that would
have picked up its electromagnetic pulse were silent. That mystified
many in the White House, but "Gus Weiss came down the hall to tell his
fellow NSC staffers not to worry. It took him another twenty years to
tell me why."

Farewell stayed secret because the blast in June 1982, estimated at three
kilotons, took place in the Siberian wilderness, with no casualties
known. Nor was the red-faced K.G.B. about to complain publicly about
being tricked by bogus technology. But all the software it had stolen
for years was suddenly suspect, which stopped or delayed the work of
thousands of worried Russian technicians and scientists.

Vetrov was caught and executed in 1983. A year later, Bill Casey ordered
the K.G.B. collection network rolled up, closing the Farewell dossier. Gus
Weiss died from a fall a few months ago. Now is a time to remember that
sometimes our spooks get it right in a big way.
