>Many systems, such as SQL interpreters and the command line shell,
have <EM
>metacharacters</EM
>,
that is, characters in their input that are not interpreted as data.
Such characters might commands, or delimit data from commands or other data.
If there&#8217;s a language specification for that system&#8217;s interface
that you&#8217;re using, then it certainly has metacharacters.
If your program invokes those other systems and allows attackers to
insert such metacharacters, the usual result is that an attacker can
completely control your program.</P

>Most database systems include a language that can let you
create arbitrary queries, and typically many other functions too.
The SQL language is especially common, and many other languages for databases

><P
>SQL and its related languages, unsurprisingly, include metacharacters.
When metacharacters are provided as input to trigger SQL metacharacters,
it&#8217;s often called
<EM
>SQL injection</EM
>.
Even if the language is technically not SQL, if it's an
attack on a language for a database system it's typically still
called a SQL injection attack.
There are many ways to trigger SQL injection attacks; attackers
can insert single or double quotes, semicolons (which act as command
separators), "--" which is a comment token, and so on.

for further discussion on this.</P
><P
>Perhaps the best single approach for countering SQL injection are
prepared statements.
Prepared statement allow programmers to identify placeholders;
a pre-exisitng library then escapes it properly for that specific
implementation.
This approach has many advantages.
First, since the library does the escaping for you,
it is  simpler and more likely to get right.
Second, it tends to produce easier-to-maintain code, since the code
tends to be easier to read.
Prepared statements are especially important when dealing with SQL,
because different SQL engines have different syntax rules.</P
><P
>There are other approaches, of course.
You can write your own escape code, but this is difficult to get correct,
and typically a waste of time since there are usually existing libraries
to do the job.
You can also use stored procedures, which can also help prevent SQL injection.</P
><P
>There are other solutions that limit inputs.
Different SQL implementations have different metacharacters, so blacklisting
is even more a bad idea for countering SQL injection.
As discussed in <A
HREF="input.html"
>Chapter 5</A
>,
define a very limited pattern and only allow data matching that
pattern to enter; if you limit your pattern to ^[0-9]$ or
^[0-9A-Za-z]*$ then you won&#8217;t have a problem.
If you must handle data that may include SQL metacharacters, a good approach
is to convert it (as early as possible) to some other encoding before
storage, e.g.,
HTML encoding (in which case you&#8217;ll need to encode any ampersand characters
too).
Also, prepend and append a quote to all user input, even
if the data is numeric; that way, insertions of white space and other
kinds of data won&#8217;t be as dangerous.</P

>Many metacharacter problems involve shell metacharacters.
An attack that tries to exploit a vulnerabliity in shell metacharacter
processing is called a
<EM
>shell injection</EM
> attack.
For example, the standard Unix-like command shell
(typically stored in /bin/sh)
interprets a number of characters specially.
If these characters are sent to the shell, then their special interpretation
will be used unless escaped; this fact can be used to break programs.
According to the WWW Security FAQ [Stein 1999, Q37], these metacharacters are:

>The # character is a comment character, and thus is also a metacharacter.
The separator values can be changed by setting the IFS environment
variable, but if you can&#8217;t trust the source of this variable you should
have thrown it out or reset it anyway as part of your environment
variable processing.</P
><P
>Unfortunately, in real life this isn&#8217;t a complete list.
Here are some other characters that can be problematic:

    if the return value of a program is tested, prepending !
    could fool a script into thinking something had failed when it
    succeeded or vice versa.
    In some shells, the "!" also accesses the command history, which can
    cause real problems.
    In bash, this only occurs for interactive mode, but tcsh
    (a csh clone found in some Linux distributions) uses "!" even in scripts.</P

>Forgetting one of these characters can be disastrous, for example,
many programs omit backslash as a shell metacharacter [rfp 1999].
As discussed in the <A
HREF="input.html"
>Chapter 5</A

by some
is to immediately escape at least all of these characters when they are input.</P
><P
>So simply creating a list of characters that are forbidden is a bad
idea (because that is a <EM
>blacklist</EM
>).
Instead, identify the characters that are acceptable, and then
forbid or correctly escape all others (a <EM
>whitelist</EM
>).</P
><P
>What makes the shell metacharacters particularly pervasive is
that several important library calls, such as popen(3) and system(3),
are implemented by calling the command shell, meaning that they will
be affected by shell metacharacters too.
Similarly, execlp(3) and execvp(3) may cause the shell to be called.
Many guidelines suggest avoiding popen(3), system(3), execlp(3), and execvp(3)
entirely and use execve(3) directly in C when trying to spawn
a process [Galvin 1998b].
At the least, avoid using system(3) when you can use the execve(3);
since system(3) uses the shell to expand characters, there is more
opportunity for mischief in system(3).
In a similar manner the Perl and shell backtick (`) also call a command shell;

NAME="FILENAMES"
>8.3.3. Problematic pathnames and filenames</A
></H2
><P
>A "pathname" is a sequence of bytes that describes how to find
a file system object.
On Unix-like systems, a pathname is a sequence of one or more filenames
separated by one or more "/".
On Windows systems a pathname is more complicated but the idea is the same.
In practice, many people use the term "filename" to refer to pathnames.</P
><P
>Unfortunately,
pathnames are often at least partly controlled by an untrusted user.
For example, it is often useful to use file/directory
names as a key to identify relevant data, but this can lead
to untrusted users controlling filenames.
Another example is when monitoring or managing of shared systems
(e.g., virtual machines or containerized filesystems);
in this case an untrusted monitoree controls filenames.
Even when an attacker should not be able to gain this kind of control,
it is often important to counter this kind of problem as a defense-in-depth
measure, to counter attackers who gain a small amount of control.</P
><P
>An obvious case is that systems are not supposed to allow
redirection outside of some direction (e.g., a "document root"
of a web server).
If a web application allowed ".", "/", and/or "\", it might be
easy to foil that rule.
For example, if a program tries to access a path that is a
concatentation of "trusted_root_path" and "username", the attacker
might be able to create a username "../../../mysecrets"
and foil the limitations.
As always, use a very limited whitelist for information that will be
used to create filenames.</P
><P
>Microsoft Windows pathnames can be difficult to deal with securely.
Windows pathname interpretations vary depending on
the version of Windows and the API used
(many calls use CreateFile which supports \\.\ - and these interpret
pathnames differently than the other calls that do not).
Perhaps most obviously, "letter:" and "\\server\share..."
have a special meaning in Windows.
A nastier issue is that there are reserved filenames,
whose form depend on the API used and the local configuration.
The built-in reserved device names are as follows:
CON, PRN, AUX, NUL, COM1, COM2, COM3, COM4, COM5, COM6, COM7, COM8, COM9, LPT1, LPT2, LPT3, LPT4, LPT5, LPT6, LPT7, LPT8, and LPT9.
Even worse, drivers can create more reserved names - so you actually
cannot know ahead-of-time what names are reserved.
You should avoid creating filenames with reserved names, both
with and without an extension;
if attacker can trick the program into reading/writing the name
(e.g., com1.txt), it may (depending on API) cause read or write to a device
instead of a file.
In this case, even simple alphanumerics can cause disaster and be
interpreted as metacharacters - this is a rare situation, since usually
alphanumerics are safe.
Windows supports "/" as a directory separator, but it conventionally
uses "\" as the directory separator (which is annoying because
\ is widely used as an escape character).
In Windows,
don't end a file or directory name with a space or period;
the underlying file system may support it, but the
Windows shell and user interface generally do not.

>Filenames and pathnames on Unix-like systems are not always easy to
deal with either.
On most Unix-like systems, a filename can be any sequence of bytes
that does not include \0 (the terminator) or slash.
One common misconception is that Unix filenames are a string of characters.
Unix filenames are not a string of one or more characters;
they are merely a sequence of bytes, so a filename
does not need to be a legal sequence of characters.
For example, while it's a common convention to interpret filenames
as a UTF-8 encoding of characters, most systems do not actually enforce this.
Indeed, they tend to enforce nothing, so many problematic filenames
can be created, including filenames with spaces (or only spaces),
control characters (including newline, tab, escape, etc.), bytes
that are not legal UTF-8, or including a leading "-"
(the marker for command options).
These problematic filenames can cause trouble later.
Some potential problems with filenames are specific to the shell, but
filename problems are not limited to the shell.</P
><P
>A common problem is that "-" is the option flag on many commands, but it is a
legal beginning of a filename.
A simple solution is to prefix all globs or filenames where needed with "./"
so that they cannot begin with "-".
So for example, never use "*.pdf" to refer to a set of PDFs; use "./*.pdf".</P
><P
>Be careful about displaying or storing pathnames, since they can include
newlines, tabs, escape (which can begin terminal controls), or sequences
that are not legal strings.
On some systems, merely displaying filenames can invoke terminal controls,
which can then run commands with the privilege of the one displaying.</P

>&#8220;extra&#8221;</SPAN

One of the more common (and dangerous) escape codes is one that brings
up a command line.
Make sure that these <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>&#8220;escape&#8221;</SPAN
> commands can&#8217;t be included
(unless you&#8217;re sure that the specific command is safe).
For example, many line-oriented mail programs (such as mail or mailx) use
tilde (~) as an escape character, which can then be used to send a number
of commands.
As a result, apparently-innocent commands such as
<SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>&#8220;mail admin &#60; file-from-user&#8221;</SPAN
> can be used to execute arbitrary programs.
Interactive programs such as vi, emacs, and ed have <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>&#8220;escape&#8221;</SPAN
> mechanisms
that allow users to run arbitrary shell commands from their session.
Always examine the documentation of programs you call to search for
escape mechanisms.
It&#8217;s best if you call only programs intended for use by other programs; see
<A
HREF="call-intentional-apis.html"
>Section 8.4</A
>.</P
><P
>The issue of avoiding
escape codes even goes down to low-level hardware components
and emulators of them.
Most modems implement the so-called <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>&#8220;Hayes&#8221;</SPAN
> command set.
Unless the command set is disabled, inducing
a delay, the phrase <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>&#8220;+++&#8221;</SPAN
>, and then another delay forces the modem
to interpret any following text as commands to the modem instead.
This can be used to implement denial-of-service attacks (by
sending <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>&#8220;ATH0&#8221;</SPAN
>, a hang-up command) or even forcing
a user to connect to someone else (a sophisticated attacker could
re-route a user&#8217;s connection through a machine under the attacker&#8217;s control).
For the specific case of modems, this is easy to counter
(e.g., add "ATS2-255" in the modem initialization string), but the
general issue still holds: if you&#8217;re controlling a lower-level component,
or an emulation of one, make sure that you disable or otherwise handle
any escape codes built into them.</P
><P
>Many <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>&#8220;terminal&#8221;</SPAN
> interfaces implement the escape
codes of ancient, long-gone physical terminals like the VT100.
These codes can be useful, for example, for bolding characters,
changing font color, or moving to a particular location
in a terminal interface.
However, do not allow arbitrary untrusted data to be sent directly
to a terminal screen, because some of those codes can cause serious problems.
On some systems you can remap keys (e.g., so when a user presses
"Enter" or a function key it sends the command you want them to run).
On some you can even send codes to
clear the screen, display a set of commands you&#8217;d like the victim to run,
and then send that set <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>&#8220;back&#8221;</SPAN
>, forcing the victim to run
the commands of the attacker&#8217;s choosing without even waiting for a keystroke.
This is typically implemented using <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>&#8220;page-mode buffering&#8221;</SPAN
>.
This security problem is why emulated tty&#8217;s (represented as device files,
usually in /dev/) should only be writeable by
their owners and never anyone else - they should never have
<SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>&#8220;other write&#8221;</SPAN
> permission set, and unless only the user is a member of
the group (i.e., the <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>&#8220;user-private group&#8221;</SPAN
> scheme), the <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>&#8220;group write&#8221;</SPAN
>
permission should not be set either for the terminal [Filipski 1986].
If you&#8217;re displaying data to the user at a (simulated) terminal, you probably
need to filter out all control characters (characters with values less
than 32) from data sent back to
the user unless they&#8217;re identified by you as safe.
Worse comes to worse, you can identify tab and newline (and maybe
carriage return) as safe, removing all the rest.
Characters with their high bits set (i.e., values greater than 127)
are in some ways trickier to handle; some old systems implement them as
if they weren&#8217;t set, but simply filtering them inhibits much international
use.
In this case, you need to look at the specifics of your situation.</P
><P
>A related problem is that the NIL character (character 0) can have
surprising effects.
Most C and C++ functions assume
that this character marks the end of a string, but string-handling routines
in other languages (such as Perl and Ada95) can handle strings containing NIL.
Since many libraries and kernel calls use the C convention, the result
is that what is checked is not what is actually used [rfp 1999].</P
><P
>When calling another program or referring to a file
it may be wise to specify its full path

For program calls,
this will eliminate possible errors in calling the <SPAN

even if the PATH value is incorrectly set.
