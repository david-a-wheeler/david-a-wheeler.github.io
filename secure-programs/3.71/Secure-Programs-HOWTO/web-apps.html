>5.8. Web-Based Application Inputs (Especially CGI Scripts)</A
></H1
><P
>Web-based applications (such as CGI scripts) run on some trusted
server and must get their
input data somehow through the web.
Since the input data generally come from untrusted users,
this input data must be validated.
Indeed, this information may have actually come from an untrusted third
party; see
<A
HREF="cross-site-malicious-content.html"
>Section 7.16</A
> for more information.
For example, CGI scripts
are passed this information
through a standard set of environment variables and through standard input.
The rest of this text will specifically discuss CGI, because it&#8217;s
the most common technique for implementing dynamic web content, but
the general issues are the same for most other dynamic web content techniques.</P
><P
>One additional complication is that many CGI inputs are provided in
so-called <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>&#8220;URL-encoded&#8221;</SPAN
> format, that is, some values are written in the
format %HH where HH is the hexadecimal code for that byte.
You or your CGI library must handle these inputs correctly by
URL-decoding the input and then checking
if the resulting byte value is acceptable.
You must correctly handle all values, including problematic
values such as %00 (NIL) and %0A (newline).
Don&#8217;t decode inputs more than once, or input such as <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>&#8220;%2500&#8221;</SPAN
>
will be mishandled (the %25 would be translated to <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>&#8220;%&#8221;</SPAN
>, and the resulting
<SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>&#8220;%00&#8221;</SPAN
> would be erroneously translated to the NIL character).</P
><P
>CGI scripts are commonly attacked by including special characters in their
inputs; see the comments above.</P
><P
>Another form of data available to web-based applications are <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>&#8220;cookies.&#8221;</SPAN
>
Again, users can provide arbitrary cookie values, so they cannot
be trusted unless special precautions are taken.
Also, cookies can be used to track users, potentially invading user privacy.
As a result, many users disable cookies, so if possible your web application
should be designed so that it does not require the use of cookies
(but see my later discussion for when you <EM
>must</EM
> authenticate
individual users).
I encourage you to avoid or limit the use of persistent cookies
(cookies that last beyond a current session), because they are easily abused.
Indeed, U.S. agencies are currently forbidden to use persistent cookies
except in special circumstances, because of the concern about
invading user privacy; see the

which is part of the
<A
HREF="http://www.defenselink.mil/webmasters"
TARGET="_top"
>DoD guidance to
webmasters</A
>.
Note that to use cookies, some browsers may insist that you
have a privacy profile (named p3p.xml on the root directory of the server).</P
><P
>Some HTML forms include client-side input checking
to prevent some illegal values; these are
typically implemented using Javascript/ECMAscript or Java.
This checking can be helpful for the user, since it can happen <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>&#8220;immediately&#8221;</SPAN
>
without requiring any network access.
However, this kind of input checking is useless for security, because
attackers can send such <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>&#8220;illegal&#8221;</SPAN
> values directly to the web server
without going through the checks.
It&#8217;s not even hard to subvert this; you don&#8217;t have to write
a program to send arbitrary data to a web application.
In general, servers must perform all their own input checking
(of form data, cookies, and so on) because
they cannot trust clients to do this securely.
In short, clients are generally not <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>&#8220;trustworthy channels&#8221;</SPAN
>.
See <A
HREF="trustworthy-channels.html"
>Section 7.12</A
>
for more information on trustworthy channels.</P
