>Many different types of programs may need to be secure programs
(as the term is defined in this book).
Some common types are:

<P

>Application programs used as viewers of remote data.
Programs used as viewers (such as word processors or file format viewers)
are often asked to view data sent remotely by an untrusted user
(this request may be automatically invoked by a web browser).
Clearly, the untrusted
user&#8217;s input should not be allowed to cause the application
to run arbitrary programs.
It&#8217;s usually unwise to support initialization macros (run when the data
is displayed); if you must, then you must create a secure sandbox
(a complex and error-prone task that almost never succeeds, which is why
you shouldn&#8217;t support macros in the first place).
Be careful of issues such as buffer overflow, discussed in
<A
HREF="buffer-overflow.html"
>Chapter 6</A
>, which might
allow an untrusted user to force the viewer to run an arbitrary program.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>Application programs used by the administrator (root).
Such programs shouldn&#8217;t trust information that can be controlled
by non-administrators.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>Local servers (also called daemons).</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>Network-accessible servers (sometimes called network daemons).</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>Web-based applications (including CGI scripts).
These are a special case of network-accessible servers, but they&#8217;re
so common they deserve their own category.
Such programs are invoked indirectly via a web server, which filters out
some attacks but nevertheless leaves many attacks that must be withstood.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>Applets (i.e., programs downloaded to the client for automatic execution).
This is something Java is especially famous for, though other languages
(such as Python) support mobile code as well.
There are several security viewpoints here; the implementer of the
applet infrastructure on the client side has to make sure that the
only operations allowed are <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>&#8220;safe&#8221;</SPAN
> ones, and the writer of an applet has
to deal with the problem of hostile hosts (in other words, you can&#8217;t
normally trust the client).
There is some research attempting to deal with running applets on
hostile hosts, but frankly
I&#8217;m skeptical of the value of these approaches
and this subject is exotic enough that I don&#8217;t cover it further here.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>setuid/setgid programs.
These programs are invoked by a local user and, when executed, are
immediately granted the privileges of the program&#8217;s owner and/or
owner&#8217;s group.
In many ways these are the hardest programs to secure, because so many
of their inputs are under the control of the untrusted user and some
of those inputs are not obvious.</P
></LI
></UL
>&#13;</P
><P
>This book merges the issues of these different types of program into
a single set.
The disadvantage of this approach is that some of the issues identified
here don&#8217;t apply to all types of programs.
In particular, setuid/setgid programs have many surprising inputs and several
of the guidelines here only apply to them.
However, things are not so clear-cut, because 
a particular program may cut across these boundaries (e.g., a CGI script
may be setuid or setgid, or be configured in a way that has the same effect),
and some programs are divided into several executables each of which
can be considered a different <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>&#8220;type&#8221;</SPAN
> of program.
The advantage of considering all of these program types together is that we can
consider all issues without trying to apply an inappropriate category
to a program.
As will be seen, many of the principles apply to all programs that
need to be secured.</P
><P
>There is a slight bias in this book toward programs written in
C, with some notes on other languages such as C++, Perl, PHP, Python,
Ada95, and Java.
This is because C is the most common language for
implementing secure programs on Unix-like systems
(other than CGI scripts, which tend to use languages such as
Perl, PHP, or Python).
Also, most other languages&#8217; implementations call the C library.
This is not to imply that C is somehow the <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>&#8220;best&#8221;</SPAN
> language for this purpose,
and most of the principles described here apply regardless of the
programming language used.</P
