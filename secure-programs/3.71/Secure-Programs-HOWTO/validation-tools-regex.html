>There are many ways to validate input.
Number ranges can be checked using typical condtions such as less-than.
If a string can only be one of a short list of possibilities, simply
enumerate the possibilities and ensure that the input is one of them.
If the input is extremely complex, tools often used to create compilers
(such as lexers and parser generators) may be appropriate, though
be sure that these tools are prepared to process malicious input.</P
><P
>In many cases regular expression libraries are especially useful for
input validation.
Many whitelists are easily expressed as regular expressions, making them
a very easy tool to use.
In addition, regular expression libraries are built-in or easily available
in almost all language (the POSIX specification even requires one).</P

NAME="REGEX-BASICS"
>5.2.1. Introduction to regular expressions</A
></H2
><P
>The regular expression language
is a simple language for describing text patterns.
There are three major variants of the language in use:
the very old POSIX <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>&#8220;basic regular expresion (BRE)&#8221;</SPAN
> format,
the POSIX <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>&#8220;extended regular expression (ERE)&#8221;</SPAN
>, and the
perl-compatible regular expression (PCRE) format.
From here on we&#8217;ll assume you&#8217;re using the ERE or PCRE variations
of the language.
In the regular expression language,
a latin letter or digit simply represents itself.
A dot (period) matches any one character (with the possible exception of
newline, depending on various options).</P
><P
>A bracketed expression matches one character, as long as that one
character is one of the characters listed inside the brackets.
Inside brackets the period has no special meaning (it just matches a period),
and a <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>&#8220;-&#8221;</SPAN
> inside brackets indicates a range,
so <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>&#8220;[A-Za-z0-9]&#8221;</SPAN
> matches one Latin alphanumeric character
(presuming you&#8217;re not using EBCDIC).</P
><P
>You can also indicate repetition, e.g.,
<SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>&#8220;?&#8221;</SPAN
> means that the previous expression is optional
(may occur 0 or 1 times),
<SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>&#8220;+&#8221;</SPAN
> means the previous expression may repeat 1 or more times, and
a <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>&#8220;*&#8221;</SPAN
> means that the previous expression may repeat 0 or more times.
More generally, <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>&#8220;{N,M}&#8221;</SPAN
> indicates that the previous expression can occur
N through M number of repetitions.
Parentheses can group a sequence so that it is considered a single pattern.
A much more complete discussion of regular expressions is given in
[Friedl 1997].</P

>5.2.2. Using regular expressions for input validation</A
></H2
><P
>The regular expression language was originally designed for searching,
not for describing input filters.
To use regular expressions as whitelists, your whitelists will
typically begin with <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>&#8220;^&#8221;</SPAN
>
(which normally means <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>&#8220;match the beginning of the string&#8221;</SPAN
>)
and end with ''$''
(which normally means <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>&#8220;match the end of the string&#8221;</SPAN
>).
Thus, you can require that an input have a Latin letter,
followed by one or more digits, using this expression:
<SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>&#8220;[A-Za-z][0-9]+&#8221;</SPAN
>.</P
><P
>A word of warning: Regular expressions support the <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>&#8220;|&#8221;</SPAN
> operator,
which means <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>&#8220;any one of these&#8221;</SPAN
>.
However, the precedence of <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>&#8220;|&#8221;</SPAN
> is different from what many expect,
and unwary developers can end up having vulnerable input validation routines
as a result.
For example, the expression <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>&#8220;^x|y$&#8221;</SPAN
> means
<SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>&#8220;begins with x, or ends with y&#8221;</SPAN
>.
In practically all cases you should surround the <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>&#8220;|&#8221;</SPAN
> branches
with parentheses when using regular expressions for input filtering, e.g.,
<SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>&#8220;^(x|y)$&#8221;</SPAN
> means <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>&#8220;either an x or a y&#8221;</SPAN
>.</P

>5.2.3. Regular expression denial of service (reDOS) attacks</A
></H2
><P
>In some cases, when using regular expressions (regexes) there is a risk
of enabling regular expression denial of service (reDOS) attacks.
Some regexes, on some implementations, can take
exponential time and memory to process certain data.
Such regexes are called "evil" regexes.
Attackers can intentionally provide triggering data (and
maybe regexes!) to cause this exponential growth, leading to a
denial-of-service.
Thus, when using regexes, developers need to avoid these regexes
or limit these effects.
In many cases this is not hard, once you're aware of the issue.</P
><P
>Fundamentally,
many modern regex engines (including those in PCRE, perl, Java, etc.)
use backtracking to implement regexes.
In these implementations, if there is more than one potential solution
for a match, if will first try one branch to try to find a match, and
if it doesn't match, it will repeatedly
backtrack to the last untried solution and try again
until all options are exhausted.
The problem is that an attacker may be able to cause many backtracks.
In general, you want to bound the number of backtracks that occur.
The primary risks are groups
with repetition, pariticularly if they are
inside more repetition or alternation with overlapping patterns.
The regex "^([a-zA-Z]+)*$" with data "aaa1" involves a large number
of backtracks; once the engine encounters the "1", many implementations
will backtrack through all possible combinations of "+" and "*" before
it can determine there is no match.</P
><P
>Simply avoiding the use of regexes doesn't reliably
counter reDOS attacks, because
naively implementing the regex processing causes exactly the same problem.
There are, however, simple things that can be done.
First, avoid running regexes provided by an attacker (or limit the time
they can run).
If you can, use a Thompson NFA-to-DFA implementation; these never
backtrack and thus are immune to the problem (though they can't provide
some useful functions like backreferences).
Otherwise, review regexes to prevent backtracking if you can.
At any point, any given character should cause only
one branch to be taken in regex (just imagine that the regex is code).
For every repetition, you should be able to uniquely determine
if the code will repeat or not based on the single next input character.
You should especially examine any repetition in a repetition - if possible,
eliminate them (these in particular cause a combinatorial explosion).
You can use regex fuzzers and static analysis tools to examine these.
In addition, you can limit the input data size first before
before using a regex; this greatly limits the effects of
exponential growth in time.
