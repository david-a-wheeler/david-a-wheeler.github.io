>SecureReality has put out a very interesting paper titled
<SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>&#8220;A Study In Scarlet - Exploiting Common Vulnerabilities in PHP&#8221;</SPAN
>
[Clowes 2001],
which discusses some of the problems in writing secure programs in PHP,
particularly in versions before PHP 4.1.0.
Clowes concludes that
<SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>&#8220;it is very hard to write a secure PHP application (in the
default configuration of PHP), even if you try&#8221;</SPAN
>.</P
><P
>Granted, there are security issues in any language, but one
particular issue stands out in older versions of PHP that arguably makes
older PHP versions
less secure than most languages: the way it loads data into its namespace.
By default, in PHP (versions 4.1.0 and lower)
all environment variables and values sent to PHP over the web
are automatically loaded into the same namespace (global variables)
that normal variables are loaded into - so attackers can set arbitrary
variables to arbitrary values, which keep their values unless explicitly
reset by a PHP program.
In addition, PHP automatically creates variables with a
default value when they&#8217;re first requested, so
it&#8217;s common for PHP programs to not initialize variables.
If you forget to set a variable, PHP can report it, but
by default PHP won&#8217;t - and note that this simply an error report, it
won&#8217;t stop an attacker who finds an unusual way to cause it.
Thus, by default PHP allows an attacker to
completely control the values of all variables in a program unless
the program takes special care to override the attacker.
Once the program takes over, it can reset these variables,
but failing to reset
any variable (even one not obvious) might open a vulnerability in the
PHP program.</P
><P
>For example, the following PHP program (an example from Clowes)
intends to only let those who
know the password to get some important information, but an attacker

>I and many others have complained about this particularly
dangerous problem; it&#8217;s particularly a problem because
PHP is widely used.
A language that&#8217;s supposed to be easy to use better make
it easy to write secure programs in, after all.
It&#8217;s possible to disable this misfeature in PHP by turning the setting
<SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>&#8220;register_globals&#8221;</SPAN
> to <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>&#8220;off&#8221;</SPAN
>, but by default PHP versions up through 4.1.0
default set this to <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>&#8220;on&#8221;</SPAN
> and PHP before 4.1.0 is harder
to use with register_globals off.
The PHP developers warned in their PHP 4.1.0 announcenment that
<SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>&#8220;as of the next semi-major version of PHP, new installations of PHP will
default to having register_globals set to off.&#8221;</SPAN
>
This has now happened; as of PHP version 4.2.0, External 
variables (from the environment, the HTTP request, cookies or the web 
server) are no longer registered in the global scope by default. The 
preferred method of accessing these external variables is by using the new 
Superglobal arrays, introduced in PHP 4.1.0.</P
><P
>PHP with <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>&#8220;register_globals&#8221;</SPAN
> set to <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>&#8220;on&#8221;</SPAN
> is a dangerous choice
for nontrivial programs - it&#8217;s just too easy to write insecure programs.
However, once <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>&#8220;register_globals&#8221;</SPAN
> is set to <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>&#8220;off&#8221;</SPAN
>, PHP is quite
a reasonable language for development.</P
><P
>The secure default should include setting
<SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>&#8220;register_globals&#8221;</SPAN
> to <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>&#8220;off&#8221;</SPAN
>, and also including several functions to
make it much easier for users to specify and limit the input they&#8217;ll
accept from external sources.
Then web servers (such as Apache) could separately configure this
secure PHP installation.
Routines could be placed in the PHP library to make it
easy for users to list the input variables they want to accept;
some functions could check the patterns these variables must have
and/or the type that the variable must be coerced to.
In my opinion, PHP is a bad choice for secure web development
if you set register_globals on.</P
><P
>As I suggested in earlier versions of this book,
PHP has been modified to become a reasonable choice
for secure web development.
However, note that PHP doesn&#8217;t have a particularly good
security vulnerability track record
(e.g., register_globals, a file upload problem, and a format
string problem in the error reporting library);
I believe that security issues were not considered sufficiently in
early editions of PHP;
I also think that the PHP developers are now emphasizing security
and that these security issues are finally getting worked out.
One evidence is the major change that the PHP developers have made to
get turn off register_globals; this had a significant impact on
PHP users, and their willingness to make this change is a good sign.
Unfortunately, it&#8217;s not yet clear how secure PHP really is;
PHP just hasn&#8217;t had much of a track record now that the developers
of PHP are examining it seriously for security issues.
Hopefully this will become clear quickly.</P
><P
>If you&#8217;ve decided to use PHP, here are some of my recommendations
(many of these recommendations are based on ways to counter
the issues that Clowes raises):
<P
></P
><UL
><LI
><P
>Set the PHP configuration option
<SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>&#8220;register_globals&#8221;</SPAN
> off, and use PHP 4.2.0 or greater.
PHP 4.1.0 adds several special arrays, particularly $_REQUEST,
which makes it far simpler to develop software in PHP
when <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>&#8220;register_globals&#8221;</SPAN
> is off.
Setting register_globals off, which is the default in PHP 4.2.0,
completely eliminates the most common PHP attacks.
If you&#8217;re assuming that register_globals is off, you should check for
this first (and halt if it&#8217;s not true) - that way, people who install
your program will quickly know there&#8217;s a problem.
Note that many third-party PHP applications cannot
work with this setting, so it can be difficult to
keep it off for an entire website.
It&#8217;s possible to set register_globals off for only some programs.
For example, for Apache, you could insert these lines into the file .htaccess
in the PHP directory (or use Directory directives to control it further):
<TABLE
BORDER="0"
BGCOLOR="#E0E0E0"
WIDTH="90%"
><TR
><TD
><FONT
COLOR="#000000"
><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
> php_flag register_globals Off
 php_flag track_vars On</PRE
></FONT
></TD
></TR
></TABLE
>
However, the .htaccess file itself is ignored unless the Apache web server
is configured to permit overrides; often the Apache global configuration
is set so that AllowOverride is set to None.
So, for Apache users,
if you can convince your web hosting service to set <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>&#8220;AllowOverride Options&#8221;</SPAN
>
in their configuration file (often /etc/http/conf/http.conf) for your
host, do that.
Then write helper functions to simplify loading the data you need
(and only that data).</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>If you must develop software where register_globals might be on while
running (e.g., a widely-deployed PHP application),
always set values not provided by the user.
Don&#8217;t depend on PHP
default values, and don&#8217;t trust any variable you haven&#8217;t explicitly set.
Note that you have to do this for <EM
>every</EM
> entry point
(e.g., every PHP program or HTML file using PHP).
The best approach is to begin each PHP program by setting all variables
you&#8217;ll be using, even if you&#8217;re simply resetting them to the
usual default values (like "" or 0).
This includes global variables referenced in included files,
even all libraries, transitively.
Unfortunately, this makes this recommendation hard to do, because few
developers truly know and understand all global variables that may be used
by all functions they call.
One lesser alternative is to search through HTTP_GET_VARS, HTTP_POST_VARS,
HTTP_COOKIE_VARS, and HTTP_POST_FILES to see if the user provided the data -
but programmers often forget to check all sources, and what happens if
PHP adds a new data source
(e.g., HTTP_POST_FILES wasn&#8217;t in old versions of PHP).
Of course, this simply tells you how to make the best of a bad
situation; in case you haven&#8217;t noticed yet, turn off
register_globals!</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>Set the error reporting level to E_ALL, and resolve all errors reported
by it during testing.
Among other things, this will complain about un-initialized variables,
which are a key issues in PHP.
This is a good idea anyway whenever you start using PHP, because
this helps debug programs, too.
There are many ways to set the error reporting level, including in the
<SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>&#8220;php.ini&#8221;</SPAN
> file (global), the <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>&#8220;.htttpd.conf&#8221;</SPAN
> file (single-host),
the <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>&#8220;.htaccess&#8221;</SPAN
> file (multi-host), or at the top of the script
through the error_reporting function.
I recommend setting the error reporting level in both the php.ini file
and also at the top of the script; that way, you&#8217;re protected if
(1) you forget to insert the command at the top of the script, or (2) move the
program to another machine and forget to change the php.ini file.
Thus, every PHP program should begin like this:
<TABLE
BORDER="0"
BGCOLOR="#E0E0E0"
WIDTH="90%"
><TR
><TD
><FONT
COLOR="#000000"
><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>  &#60;?php error_reporting(E_ALL);?&#62;</PRE
></FONT
></TD
></TR
></TABLE
>
It could be argued that this error reporting should be turned on
during development, but turned off when actually run on a real site
(since such error message could give useful information to an attacker).
The problem is that if they&#8217;re disabled during <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>&#8220;actual use&#8221;</SPAN
> it&#8217;s all
too easy to leave them disabled during development.
So for the moment, I suggest the simple approach of simply including it
in every entrance.
A much better approach is to record all errors, but direct the error reports
so they&#8217;re only included in a log file
(instead of having them reported to the attacker).</P

><LI
><P
>Filter any user information used to create filenames carefully, in
particular to prevent remote file access.
PHP by default comes with <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>&#8220;remote files&#8221;</SPAN
> functionality -- that means
that file-opening commands like fopen(), that in other languages can
only open local files, can actually be used to invoke web or ftp
requests from another site.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>Do not use old-style PHP file uploads; use the HTTP_POST_FILES array
and related functions.
PHP supports file uploads by uploading the file to some
temporary directory with a special filename.
PHP originally set a collection of variables to indicate where that filename
was, but since an attacker can control variable names and their values,
attackers could use that ability to cause great mischief.
Instead, always use HTTP_POST_FILES and related functions to access
uploaded files.
Note that even in this case, PHP&#8217;s approach permits attackers to
temporarily upload files to you with arbitrary content, which is
risky by itself.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>Only place protected entry points in the document tree; place all
other code (which should be most of it) outside the document tree.
PHP has a history of unfortunate advice on this topic.
Originally, PHP users were supposed to use the <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>&#8220;.inc&#8221;</SPAN
> (include)
extension for <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>&#8220;included&#8221;</SPAN
> files, but these included files often had
passwords and other information, and Apache would just give requesters
the contents of the <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>&#8220;.inc&#8221;</SPAN
> files when asked to do so when they
were in the document tree.
Then developers gave all files a <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>&#8220;.php&#8221;</SPAN
> extension - which meant that the
contents weren&#8217;t seen, but now files never meant to be entry points
became entry points and were sometimes exploitable.
As mentioned earlier, the usual security advice is the best:
place only the proected entry points (files) in the document tree, and
place other code (e.g., libraries) outside the document tree.
There shouldn&#8217;t be any <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>&#8220;.inc&#8221;</SPAN
> files in the document tree at all.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>Avoid the session mechanism.
The <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>&#8220;session&#8221;</SPAN
> mechanism is handy for storing persistent data, but
its current implementation has many problems.
First, by default sessions store information in temporary files - so
if you&#8217;re on a multi-hosted system, you open yourself up to many attacks and
revelations.
Even those who aren&#8217;t currently multi-hosted may find themselves
multi-hosted later!
You can "tie" this information into a database instead of the filesystem,
but if others on a multi-hosted database can access that database with the
same permissions, the problem is the same.
There are also ambiguities if you&#8217;re not careful
(<SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>&#8220;is this the session value or an attacker&#8217;s value&#8221;</SPAN
>?)
and this is another case where an attacker can force a file or
key to reside
on the server with content of their choosing - a dangerous situation -
and the attacker can even control to some extent the name of the file or key
where this data will be placed.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>Use directives to limit privileges
(such as safe_mode, disable_function, and open_basedir), but do not rely
on them.
These directives can help limit some simple casual
attacks, so they&#8217;re worth applying.
However, they&#8217;re unlikely to be sufficient to protect against real attacks;
they depend only on the user-space PHP program to do protection, a function
it&#8217;s not really designed to perform.
Instead, you should employ operating system protections (e.g., running
separate processes and users) for serious protection.</P
></LI

><P
>For all inputs, check that they match a pattern for acceptability
(as with any language), and then use type casting to coerce non-string data
into the type it should have.
Develop <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>&#8220;helper&#8221;</SPAN
> functions to easily check and import a selected list
of (expected) inputs.
PHP is loosely typed, and this can cause trouble.
For example, if an input datum has the value "000", it won&#8217;t be equal to "0"
nor is it empty().
This is particularly important for associative arrays, because their
indexes are strings; this means that $data["000"]
is different than $data["0"].
For example, to make sure $bar has type double (after making sure it
only has the format legal for a double):

>Be careful of any functions that
execute PHP code as strings - make sure attackers cannot control
the string contents.
This includes
eval(),
exec(),
include(),
passthru(),
popen(),
preg_replace() when the /e modifier is used,
require(),
system(),
and the backtick operator.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>Be especially careful of risky functions.
For example, this includes functions that open files
(e.g., fopen(), readfile(), and file()); make sure attackers cannot
force the program to open arbitrary files.
Older versions of PHP (prior to 4.3.0) had a buffer overflow vulnerability
in the wordwrap() function, so if you use old versions beware
(or even better, upgrade, and make sure your customers upgrade by
checking the version number in the installer).</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>Use magic_quotes_gpc() where appropriate - this eliminates many kinds of
attacks.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>Avoid file uploads, and consider modifying the php.ini file to
disable them (file_uploads = Off).
File uploads have had security holes in the past, so on older PHP&#8217;s this
is a necessity, and until more experience shows that they&#8217;re safe this
isn&#8217;t a bad thing to remove.
Remember, in general, to secure a system you should disable or remove
anything you don&#8217;t need.</P
