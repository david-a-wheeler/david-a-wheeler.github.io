>Signals are a simple form of <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>&#8220;interruption&#8221;</SPAN
> in the Unix-like OS world,
and are an ancient part of Unix.
A process can set a <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>&#8220;signal&#8221;</SPAN
> on another process (say using
kill(1) or kill(2)), and that other process would receive and
handle the signal asynchronously.
For a process to have permission to send an arbitrary
signal to some other process,
the sending process must either have root privileges, or
the real or effective user ID of the sending process
must equal the real or saved set-user-ID of the receiving process.
However, some signals can be sent in other ways.
In particular, SIGURG can be delivered over a network through the
TCP/IP out-of-band (OOB) message.</P
><P
>Although signals are an ancient part of Unix, they've had different
semantics in different implementations.
Basically, they involve questions such as
<SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>&#8220;what happens when a signal
occurs while handling another signal&#8221;</SPAN
>?
The older Linux libc 5 used a different set of semantics for some signal
operations than the newer GNU libc libraries.
Calling C library functions is often unsafe within a
signal handler, and even some system calls aren&#8217;t safe;
you need to examine the documentation for each call you make to see
if it promises to be safe to call inside a signal.
For more information, see the glibc FAQ (on some systems a local
copy is available at <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/usr/doc/glibc-*/FAQ</TT
>).</P
><P
>For new programs, just use the POSIX signal system
(which in turn was based on BSD work); this set is widely supported
and doesn&#8217;t have some of the problems
that some of the older signal systems did.
The POSIX signal system is based on using the sigset_t datatype,
which can
be manipulated through a set of operations: sigemptyset(),
sigfillset(), sigaddset(), sigdelset(), and sigismember().
You can read about these in sigsetops(3).
Then use sigaction(2), sigprocmask(2),
sigpending(2), and sigsuspend(2) to set up an manipulate signal handling
(see their man pages for more information).</P
><P
>In general, make any signal handlers very short and simple, and
look carefully for race conditions.
Signals, since they are by nature asynchronous,
can easily cause race conditions.</P
><P
>A common convention exists for servers: if you receive SIGHUP, you should
close any log files, reopen and reread configuration files, and then
re-open the log files.
This supports reconfiguration without halting the server and
log rotation without data loss.
If you are writing a server where this convention makes sense,
please support it.</P
><P
>Michal Zalewski [2001] has written an excellent tutorial on how
signal handlers are exploited, and has recommendations for how to
eliminate signal race problems.
I encourage looking at his summary for more information; here are
my recommendations, which are similar to Michal&#8217;s work:

>Where possible, have your signal handlers unconditionally set a specific flag
and do nothing else.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>If you must have more complex signal handlers,
use only calls specifically designated as being safe for use
in signal handlers.
In particular,
don&#8217;t use malloc() or free() in C (which on most systems
aren&#8217;t protected against signals), nor the many functions that depend on them
(such as the printf() family and syslog()).
You could try to <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>&#8220;wrap&#8221;</SPAN
> calls to insecure library calls with a check
to a global flag (to avoid re-entry), but I wouldn&#8217;t recommend it.</P

><P
>Block signal delivery during all non-atomic operations in the program, and
block signal delivery inside signal handlers.</P
