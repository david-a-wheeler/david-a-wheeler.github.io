>One special case where cross-site malicious content must be
prevented are web applications
which are designed to accept HTML or XHTML from one user, and then send it on
to other users
(see <A
HREF="cross-site-malicious-content.html"
>Section 7.16</A

more information on cross-site malicious content).
The following subsections discuss filtering this specific kind of input,
since handling it is such a common requirement.</P

NAME="REMOVE-HTML-TAGS"
>5.13.1. Remove or Forbid Some HTML Data</A
></H2
><P
>It&#8217;s safest to remove all possible (X)HTML tags so they cannot affect anything,
and this is relatively easy to do.
As noted above, you should already be identifying the list of legal
characters, and rejecting or removing those characters that aren&#8217;t
in the list.
In this filter, simply don&#8217;t include the following characters in
the list of legal characters: <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>&#8220;&#60;&#8221;</SPAN
>, <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>&#8220;&#62;&#8221;</SPAN
>, and <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>&#8220;&#38;&#8221;</SPAN
> (and if
they&#8217;re used in attributes, the double-quote character <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>&#8220;"&#8221;</SPAN
>).
If browsers only operated according the HTML specifications, the <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>&#8220;&#62;"&#8221;</SPAN
>
wouldn&#8217;t need to be removed, but in practice it must be removed.
This is because some browsers assume that the author of the page
really meant to put in an opening "&#60;" and <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>&#8220;helpfully&#8221;</SPAN
> insert one -
attackers can exploit this behavior and use the "&#62;" to create an
undesired "&#60;".</P
><P
>Usually the character set for transmitting HTML is
ISO-8859-1 (even when sending international text),
so the filter should also omit most control characters (linefeed and
tab are usually okay) and characters with their high-order bit set.</P
><P
>One problem with this approach is that it can really surprise users,
especially those entering international text if all international
text is quietly removed.
If the invalid characters are quietly removed without warning,
that data will be irrevocably lost and cannot be reconstructed later.
One alternative is forbidding such characters and sending error messages
back to users who attempt to use them.
This at least warns users, but doesn&#8217;t give them the functionality
they were looking for.
Other alternatives are encoding this data or validating this data,
which are discussed next.</P

NAME="ENCODING-HTML-TAGS"
>5.13.2. Encoding HTML Data</A
></H2
><P
>An alternative that is nearly as safe
is to transform the critical characters so they won&#8217;t
have their usual meaning in HTML.
This can be done by translating all "&#60;" into "&#38;lt;",
"&#62;" into "&#38;gt;", and "&#38;" into "&#38;amp;".
Arbitrary international characters can be encoded in Latin-1
using the format "&#38;#value;" - do not forget the ending semicolon.
Encoding the international characters means you must know what the
input encoding was, of course.</P
><P
>One possible danger here is that if these encodings are accidentally
interpreted twice, they will become a vulnerability.
However, this approach at least permits later users to see the
"intent" of the input.</P

><P
>Some applications, to work at all, must accept HTML from third parties
and send them on to their users.
Beware - you are treading dangerous ground at this point; be sure
that you really want to do this.
Even the idea of accepting HTML from arbitrary places
is controversial among some security practitioners, because it is extremely
difficult to get it right.</P
><P
>However, if your application must accept HTML, and you believe
that it&#8217;s worth the risk, at least identify a list
of <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>&#8220;safe&#8221;</SPAN
> HTML commands and only permit those commands.</P
><P
>Here is a minimal set of safe HTML tags
that might be useful for applications (such as guestbooks)
that support short comments:
&#60;p&#62; (paragraph),
&#60;b&#62; (bold),
&#60;i&#62; (italics),
&#60;em&#62; (emphasis),
&#60;strong&#62; (strong emphasis),
&#60;pre&#62; (preformatted text),
&#60;br&#62; (forced line break - note it doesn&#8217;t require a closing tag),
as well as all their ending tags.</P
><P
>Not only do you need to ensure that only a small set
of <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>&#8220;safe&#8221;</SPAN
> HTML commands are accepted, you also need to ensure
that they are properly nested and closed
(i.e., that the HTML commands are <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>&#8220;balanced&#8221;</SPAN
>).
In XML, this is termed <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>&#8220;well-formed&#8221;</SPAN
> data.
A few exceptions could be made if you&#8217;re accepting standard HTML
(e.g., supporting an implied &#60;/p&#62; where not provided before a
&#60;p&#62; would be fine), but trying to accept HTML in its full
generality (which can infer balancing closing tags in many cases)
is not needed for most applications.
Indeed, if you&#8217;re trying to stick to XHTML (instead of HTML), then
well-formedness is a requirement.
Also, HTML tags are case-insensitive; tags can be upper case,
lower case, or a mixture.
However, if you intend to accept XHTML
then you need to require all tags to be in lower case
(XML is case-sensitive; XHTML uses XML and requires the tags to be
in lower case).</P
><P
>Here are a few random tips about doing this.
Usually you should design whatever surrounds the HTML text and the
set of permitted tags so that the contributed text cannot be misinterpreted
as text from the <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>&#8220;main&#8221;</SPAN
> site (to prevent forgeries).
Don&#8217;t accept any attributes unless you&#8217;ve checked the attribute type and
its value; there are many attributes that support things such as
Javascript that can cause trouble for your users.
You&#8217;ll notice that in the above list I didn&#8217;t include any attributes at all,
which is certainly the safest course.
You should probably give a warning message if an unsafe tag is used,
but if that&#8217;s not practical, encoding the critical characters
(e.g., "&#60;" becomes "&#38;lt;") prevents data loss while
simultaneously keeping the users safe.</P
><P
>Be careful when expanding this set, and in general be restrictive of
what you accept.
If your patterns are too generous, the browser may interpret the
sequences differently than you expect, resulting in a potential
exploit.
For example, FozZy posted on Bugtraq (1 April 2002)
some sequences that permitted
exploitation in various web-based mail systems,
which may give you an idea of the kinds of problems you need to defend
against.

>Careful readers will notice that I did not include the hypertext link tag
&#60;a&#62; as a safe tag in HTML.
Clearly, you could add
&#60;a href="safe URI"&#62; (hypertext link) to the safe list
(not permitting any other attributes unless you&#8217;ve checked their
contents).
If your application requires it, then do so.
However, permitting third parties to create links
is much less safe, because defining a <SPAN

turns out to be very difficult.
Many browsers accept
all sorts of URIs which may be dangerous to the user.
This section discusses how to validate URIs from third parties for
re-presenting to others, including URIs incorporated into HTML.</P
><P
>First, there&#8217;s the problem that URLs -- while not necessarily dangerous
per se -- reference spam sites, and as a result, some organizations
work hard to insert links to their own sites to increase their search rankings.
You need to remove the incentive for strangers to insert worthless
links their site.
Thus, if you allow arbitrary users to insert information that creates
links (like a blog or comment form),
then you should implement the approach described by
<A
HREF="http://www.google.com/googleblog/2005/01/preventing-comment-spam.html"
TARGET="_top"
>Google&#8217;s "Preventing comment spam"</A
>.
Basically, add a rel="nofollow" to the hypertext link, so that it
looks like this: &#60;a href=".." rel="nofollow"&#62;.
That way, search engines will know that this link information was provided
by a third party and shouldn&#8217;t be followed for search ranking purposes.</P
><P
>First, let&#8217;s look briefly at URI syntax (as defined by various specifications).
URIs can be either <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>&#8220;absolute&#8221;</SPAN
> or <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>&#8220;relative&#8221;</SPAN
>.
The syntax of an absolute URI looks like this:
<TABLE
BORDER="0"
BGCOLOR="#E0E0E0"
WIDTH="100%"
><TR
><TD
><FONT
COLOR="#000000"
><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>scheme://authority[path][?query][#fragment]</PRE
></FONT
></TD
></TR
></TABLE
>
A URI starts with a scheme name (such as <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>&#8220;http&#8221;</SPAN
>), the characters <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>&#8220;://&#8221;</SPAN
>,
the authority (such as <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>&#8220;www.dwheeler.com&#8221;</SPAN
>), a path
(which looks like a directory or file name), a question mark followed by
a query, and a hash (<SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>&#8220;#&#8221;</SPAN
>) followed by a fragment identifier.
The square brackets surround optional portions - e.g., many URIs don&#8217;t
actually include the query or fragment.
Some schemes may not permit some of the data (e.g., paths, queries, or
fragments), and many schemes have additional requirements unique to them.
Many schemes permit the <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>&#8220;authority&#8221;</SPAN
> field to identify
optional usernames, passwords, and ports, using this syntax for the
<SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>&#8220;authority&#8221;</SPAN

There are a limited number of characters permitted in most of the URI,
so to get around this problem, other 8-bit characters may be <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>&#8220;URL encoded&#8221;</SPAN
>
as %hh (where hh is the hexadecimal value of the 8-bit character).
For more detailed information on valid URIs, see IETF RFC 2396 and its
related specifications.</P
><P
>Now that we've looked at the syntax of URIs, let&#8217;s examine the risks
of each part:
<P
></P
><UL
><LI
><P
>Scheme:
Many schemes are downright dangerous.
Permitting someone to insert a <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>&#8220;javascript&#8221;</SPAN
> scheme into your material
would allow them to trivially mount denial-of-service attacks
(e.g., by repeatedly creating windows so the user&#8217;s machine freezes or
becomes unusable).
More seriously, they might be able to exploit a known vulnerability in
the javascript implementation.
Some schemes can be a nuisance, such as <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>&#8220;mailto:&#8221;</SPAN
> when a mailing
is not expected, and some schemes may not be sufficiently secure
on the client machine.
Thus, it&#8217;s necessary to limit the set of allowed schemes to
just a few safe schemes.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>Authority:
Ideally, you should limit user links to <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>&#8220;safe&#8221;</SPAN
> sites, but this is
difficult to do in practice.
However, you can certainly do something about usernames, passwords,
and port numbers: you should forbid them.
Systems expecting usernames (especially with passwords!) are probably
guarding more important material;
rarely is this needed in publicly-posted URIs, and someone could try
to use this functionality to convince users
to expose information they have access to and/or
use it to modify the information.
Such URIs permit semantic attacks; see
<A
HREF="semantic-attacks.html"
>Section 7.17</A
>
for more information.
Usernames without passwords are no less dangerous, since browsers typically
cache the passwords.
You should not usually permit specification of ports, because
different ports expect different protocols and the resulting
<SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>&#8220;protocol confusion&#8221;</SPAN
> can produce an exploit.
For example, on some systems it&#8217;s possible to use the <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>&#8220;gopher&#8221;</SPAN
> scheme
and specify the SMTP (email) port to cause a user to send email of the
attacker&#8217;s choosing.
You might permit a few special cases (e.g., http ports 8008 and 8080),
but on the whole it&#8217;s not worth it.
The host when specified by name actually has a fairly limited character set
(using the DNS standards).
Technically, the standard doesn&#8217;t permit the underscore (<SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>&#8220;_&#8221;</SPAN
>) character,
but Microsoft ignored this part of the standard and even requires the
use of the underscore in some circumstances, so you probably should allow it.
Also, there&#8217;s been a great deal of work on supporting international
characters in DNS names, which is not further discussed here.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>Path:
Permitting a path is usually okay, but unfortunately some applications
use part of the path as query data, creating an opening we&#8217;ll discuss next.
Also, paths are allowed to contain phrases like <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>&#8220;..&#8221;</SPAN
>, which can expose
private data in a poorly-written web server;
this is less a problem than it once was and really should be fixed
by the web server.
Since it&#8217;s only the phrase <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>&#8220;..&#8221;</SPAN
> that&#8217;s special, it&#8217;s reasonable to
look at paths (and possibly query data) and forbid <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>&#8220;../&#8221;</SPAN
> as a content.
However, if your validator permits URL escapes, this can be difficult;
now you need to prevent versions where some of these characters are
escaped, and may also have to deal with various <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>&#8220;illegal&#8221;</SPAN
> character
encodings of these characters as well.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>Query:
Query formats (beginning with "?") can be a security risk
because some query formats actually cause actions to occur on the serving end.
They shouldn&#8217;t, and your applications shouldn&#8217;t, as discussed in
<A
HREF="avoid-get-non-queries.html"
>Section 5.14</A
> for more information.
However, we have to acknowledge the reality as a serious problem.
In addition, many web sites are actually <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>&#8220;redirectors&#8221;</SPAN
> - they take a
parameter specifying where the user should be redirected, and send back
a command redirecting the user to the new location.
If an attacker references such sites and provides
a more dangerous URI as the redirection value, and the
browser blithely obeys the redirection, this could be a problem.
Again, the user&#8217;s browser should be more careful, but not all user
browsers are sufficiently cautious.
Also, many web applications have vulnerabilities that can be
exploited with certain query values, but in general this is hard to
prevent.
The official URI specifications don&#8217;t sanction the <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>&#8220;+&#8221;</SPAN
> (plus) character,
but in practice the <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>&#8220;+&#8221;</SPAN
> character often represents the space character.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>Fragment:
Fragments basically locate a portion of a document; I&#8217;m unaware of
an attack based on fragments as long as the syntax is legal, but the
legality of its syntax does need checking.
Otherwise, an attacker might be able to insert a character such as the
double-quote (") and prematurely end the URI (foiling any checking).</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>URL escapes:
URL escapes are useful because they can represent arbitrary 8-bit
characters; they can also be very dangerous for the same reasons.
In particular, URL escapes can represent control characters, which many
poorly-written web applications are vulnerable to.
In fact, with or without URL escapes, many web applications are vulnerable
to certain characters (such as backslash, ampersand, etc.), but again
this is difficult to generalize.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>Relative URIs:
Relative URIs should be reasonably safe (if you manage the web site well),
although in some applications there&#8217;s no good reason to allow them either.</P
></LI
></UL
>
Of course, there is a trade-off with simplicity as well.
Simple patterns are easier to understand, but
they aren&#8217;t very refined (so they tend to be too permissive or
too restrictive, even more than a refined pattern).
Complex patterns can be more exact, but they are more likely to have
errors, require more performance to use, and can be hard to
implement in some circumstances.</P

>This pattern doesn&#8217;t permit many potentially dangerous capabilities
such as queries, fragments, ports, or relative URIs,
and it only permits a few schemes.
It prevents the use of the <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>&#8220;%&#8221;</SPAN
> character, which is used in URL escapes
and can be used to specify characters that the server may not be
prepared to handle.
Since it doesn&#8217;t permit either <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>&#8220;:&#8221;</SPAN
> or URL escapes, it doesn&#8217;t permit
specifying port numbers, and even using it to redirect to a
more dangerous URI would be difficult (due to the lack of the escape character).
It also prevents the use of a number of other characters; again, many
poorly-designed web applications can&#8217;t handle a number of
<SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>&#8220;unexpected&#8221;</SPAN
> characters.</P
><P
>Even this <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>&#8220;mostly safe&#8221;</SPAN
> URI permits
a number of questionable URIs, such as
subdirectories (via <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>&#8220;/&#8221;</SPAN
>) and attempts to move up directories (via `..'');
illegal queries of this kind should be caught by the server.
It permits some illegal host identifiers (e.g., <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>&#8220;20.20&#8221;</SPAN
>),
though I know of no case where this would be a security weakness.
Some web applications treat subdirectories as query data (or worse,
as command data); this is hard to prevent in general since finding
<SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>&#8220;all poorly designed web applications&#8221;</SPAN
> is hopeless.
You could prevent the use of all paths, but this would make it
impossible to reference most Internet information.
The pattern also allows references to local server information
(through patterns such as "http:///", "http://localhost/", and
"http://127.0.0.1") and access to servers on an internal network;
here you&#8217;ll have to depend on the servers correctly interpreting the
resulting HTTP GET request as solely a request for information and not
a request for an action,
as recommended in <A
HREF="avoid-get-non-queries.html"
>Section 5.14</A
>.
Since query forms aren&#8217;t permitted by this pattern, in many environments
this should be sufficient.</P
><P
>Unfortunately, the <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>&#8220;mostly safe&#8221;</SPAN
>
pattern also prevents a number of quite legitimate and useful URIs.
For example,
many web sites use the <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>&#8220;?&#8221;</SPAN
> character to identify specific documents
(e.g., articles on a news site).
The <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>&#8220;#&#8221;</SPAN
> character is useful for specifying specific sections of a document,
and permitting relative URIs can be handy in a discussion.
Various permitted characters and URL escapes aren&#8217;t included in the
<SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>&#8220;mostly safe&#8221;</SPAN
> pattern.
For example, without permitting URL escapes, it&#8217;s difficult to access
many non-English pages.
If you truly need such functionality, then you can use less safe patterns,
realizing that you&#8217;re exposing your users to higher risk while
giving your users greater functionality.</P
><P
>One pattern that permits queries, but at
least limits the protocols and ports used is the following,
which I&#8217;ll call the <SPAN

multiple queries, queries in ftp, and so on.
It does have the advantage of being relatively simple.</P

>Even the sophisticated pattern shown above doesn&#8217;t forbid all illegal URIs.
For example, again, "20.20" isn&#8217;t a legal domain name, but it&#8217;s allowed
by the pattern; however, to my knowledge
this shouldn&#8217;t cause any security problems.
The sophisticated pattern forbids URL escapes that represent
control characters (e.g., %00 through $1F) - 
the smallest permitted escape value is %20 (ASCII space).
Forbidding control characters prevents some trouble, but it&#8217;s
also limiting; change "2-9" to "0-9" everywhere if you need to support sending
all control characters to arbitrary web applications.
This pattern does permit all other URL escape values in paths,
which is useful for international characters but could cause trouble
for a few systems which can&#8217;t handle it.
The pattern at least prevents spaces, linefeeds,
double-quotes, and other dangerous characters
from being in the URI, which prevents other kinds of
attacks when incorporating the URI into a generated document.
Note that the pattern permits <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>&#8220;+&#8221;</SPAN
> in many places, since in practice
the plus is often used to replace the space character
in queries and fragments.</P
><P
>Unfortunately, as noted above,
there are attacks which can work through any technique that permit query data,
and there don&#8217;t seem to be really good defenses for them once you
permit queries.
So, you could strip out the ability to use query data from the
pattern above, but permit the other forms, producing a

>As far as I can tell, as long as these patterns are only used to check
hypertext anchors selected by the user (the "&#60;a&#62;" tag)
this approach also prevents the insertion of <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>&#8220;web bugs&#8221;</SPAN

Web bugs are simply text that allow someone other
than the originating web server
of the main page to track information such as who read
the content and when they read it -
see <A
HREF="embedded-content-bugs.html"
>Section 8.7</A

This isn&#8217;t true if you use the &#60;img&#62; (image) tag with the same
checking rules - the image tag is loaded immediately, permitting
someone to add a <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>&#8220;web bug&#8221;</SPAN
>.
Once again, this presumes that you&#8217;re not permitting any attributes;
many attributes can be quite dangerous and pierce the security you&#8217;re
trying to provide.</P
><P
>Please note that all of these patterns require the entire URI match
the pattern.
An unfortunate fact of these patterns is that they limit the
allowable patterns in a way that forbids many useful ones
(e.g., they prevent the use of new URI schemes).
Also, none of them can prevent the very real problem that some web sites
perform more than queries when presented with a query - and some of these
web sites are internal to an organization.
As a result, no URI can really be safe until there
are no web sites that accept GET queries as an action
(see <A
HREF="avoid-get-non-queries.html"
>Section 5.14</A
>).
For more information about legal URLs/URIs, see IETF RFC 2396;
domain name syntax is further discussed in IETF RFC 1034.</P

>Since filtering this kind of input is easy to get wrong, other
alternatives have been discussed as well.
One option is to ask users to use a different language, much simpler
than HTML, that you&#8217;ve designed - and you give that language very limited
functionality.
Another approach is parsing the HTML into some internal <SPAN

>&#8220;safe&#8221;</SPAN

and then translating that safe format back to HTML.</P
><P
>Filtering can be done during input, output, or both.
The CERT recommends filtering data during the output process,
just before it is rendered as part of the dynamic page.
This is because, if it is done correctly, 
this approach ensures that all dynamic content is filtered.
The CERT believes that filtering on the input side is less effective
because dynamic content can be entered into a web sites database(s) via
methods other than HTTP, and in this case,
the web server may never see the data as part of the input process.
Unless the filtering is implemented in all places where dynamic data
is entered, the data elements may still be remain tainted.</P
><P
>However, I don&#8217;t agree with CERT on this point for all cases.
The problem is that it&#8217;s just as easy to forget to filter all the output
as the input, and allowing <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>&#8220;tainted&#8221;</SPAN
> input into your system
is a disaster waiting to happen anyway.
A secure program has to filter its inputs anyway, so it&#8217;s sometimes better
to include all of these checks as part of the input filtering
(so that maintainers can see what the rules really are).
And finally, in some secure programs there are many different program
locations that may output a value, but only a very few ways and locations
where a data can be input into it;
in such cases filtering on input may be a better idea.</P
