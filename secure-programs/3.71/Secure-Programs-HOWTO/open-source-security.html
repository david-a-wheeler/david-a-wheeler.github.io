>There&#8217;s been a lot of debate by security practitioners
about the impact of open source approaches on security.
One of the key issues is that open source exposes the source code
to examination by everyone, both the attackers and defenders,
and reasonable people disagree about the ultimate impact of this situation.

He identifies and then counters two main claims made by proprietary vendors:
(1) that release of code benefits attackers more than anyone else because
a lot of hostile eyes can also look at open-source code, and
that (2) a few expert eyes are better than several random ones.
He first notes that while giving programmers access to a piece of software

there is a group of programmers who can be expected to care deeply:

access to source code lets users improve system security -- if they have

vulnerable to nonmalicious faults. Third, a survey of three operating
systems indicates that one open source operating system experienced less
exposure in the form of known but unpatched vulnerabilities over a 12-month
period than was experienced by either of two proprietary counterparts.
Last, closed and proprietary system development models face disincentives

discuss the pluses and minuses of open source software.
As with other papers, they note that just because the software
is open to review, it should not automatically follow that
such a review has actually been performed.
Indeed, they note that this is a general problem for all software,
open or closed - it is often questionable if many people examine any
given piece of software.
One interesting point is that they demonstrate that
attackers can learn about a
vulnerability in a closed source program (Windows)
from patches made to an OSS/FS program (Linux).
In this example,
Linux developers fixed a vulnerability before attackers tried to attack it,
and attackers correctly surmised that a similar problem might be still be in
Windows (and it was).
Unless OSS/FS programs are forbidden, this kind of learning is difficult
to prevent.
Therefore, the existance of an OSS/FS program can reveal the vulnerabilities
of both the OSS/FS and proprietary program performing the same function -
but at in this example, the OSS/FS program was fixed first.</P

><P
>It&#8217;s been argued that a 
system without source code is more secure because,
since there&#8217;s less information available for an attacker, it should
be harder for an attacker to find the vulnerabilities.
This argument has a number of weaknesses, however, because
although source code is extremely important when trying to add
new capabilities to a program,
attackers generally don&#8217;t need source code to find a vulnerability.
Also, this argument assumes you can always keep the source code a
secret, which is often untrue.</P

CLASS="QUOTE"

and <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"

> acts. In the real world, it is much easier to
destroy a car than to build one. In the software world, it is
much easier to find and exploit a vulnerability than to
add new significant new functionality to that software.
Attackers have many advantages against defenders because of this difference.
Software developers must try to have no security-relevant mistakes
anywhere in their code, while attackers only need to find one.
Developers are primarily paid to get their programs to work...
attackers don&#8217;t need to make the program work, they only need to
find a single weakness. And as I&#8217;ll describe in a moment, it takes
less information to attack a program than to modify one.</P
><P
>Generally attackers (against both open and closed programs) start by
knowing about the general kinds of security problems programs have.
There&#8217;s no point in hiding this information; it&#8217;s already out, and
in any case, defenders need that kind of information to defend
themselves.
Attackers then use techniques to try to find those problems;
I&#8217;ll group the techniques into <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>&#8220;dynamic&#8221;</SPAN
> techniques (where you
run the program) and <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>&#8220;static&#8221;</SPAN

the program&#8217;s code - be it source code or machine code).</P
><P
>In <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>&#8220;dynamic&#8221;</SPAN
> approaches, an attacker runs the program,
sending it data (often problematic data), and sees
if the programs&#8217; response indicates a common vulnerability.
Open and closed programs have no difference here, since the attacker isn&#8217;t
looking at code.</P
><P
>Attackers may also look at the code, the <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>&#8220;static&#8221;</SPAN
> approach.
For open source software, they&#8217;ll
probably look at the source code and search it for patterns.
For closed source software, you can search the machine code
(usually presented in assembly language format to simplify the
task) for patterns that suggest security problems.
In fact, there&#8217;s are several tools that do this.
Attackers might also use tools called
<SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>&#8220;decompilers&#8221;</SPAN
> that turn the machine code back into source code
and then search the source code for the vulnerable patterns
(the same way they would search for vulnerabilities in source code
in open source software).
See Flake [2001] for one discussion of how closed code can still be examined
for security vulnerabilities (e.g., using disassemblers).
This point is important:
even if an attacker wanted to use source code to find a vulnerability,
a closed source program has no advantage, because the attacker
can use a disassembler to re-create the source code of the product
(for analysis), or use a binary scanning tool.</P
><P
>Non-developers might ask <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>&#8220;if decompilers can create source code
from machine code, then why do developers say they need
source code instead of just machine code?&#8221;</SPAN
>
The problem is that although developers don&#8217;t need source
code to find security problems, developers do need source code to make
substantial improvements to the program.
Although decompilers can turn machine code back into a
<SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>&#8220;source code&#8221;</SPAN
> of sorts, the resulting source code
is extremely hard to modify. Typically most understandable names are
lost, so instead of variables like <SPAN

<SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"

<SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>&#8220;f123124&#8221;</SPAN
>, and the code itself may have spatterings of
assembly in it.
Also, _ALL_ comments and design information are lost.
This isn&#8217;t a serious problem for finding security problems, because
generally you&#8217;re searching for patterns indicating vulnerabilities,
not for internal variable or method names.
Thus, decompilers and binary code scanning tools
can be useful for finding ways to attack programs,
or to see how vulnerable a program is,
but aren&#8217;t helpful for updating programs.</P
><P
>Thus, developers will say <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>&#8220;source code is vital&#8221;</SPAN
>
when they intend to add functionality), but the fact that the source
code for closed source programs is hidden doesn&#8217;t protect the program
very much.
In fact, users of binary-only programs can have a problem when they
use decompilers or binary scanning tools;
it&#8217;s quite possible for
a diligent user to know of a security flaw they can exploit but
can&#8217;t easily fix, and they many not be able to convince the vendor
to fix it either.</P
><P
>And this assumes you can keep the source code secret from attackers anyway.
For example,
Microsoft has had at least parts of its source code stolen several
times, at least once from Microsoft itself and at least once from
another company it shared data with.
Microsoft also has programs to share its source code with various
governments, companies, and educational settings; some of those
organizations include attackers, and those organizations
could be attacked by others to acquire the source code.
I use this merely as an example; there are many reasons source code
must be shared by many companies.
And this doesn&#8217;t even take into consideration that aggreved workers
might maliciously release the source code.
Depending on long-term secrecy of source code is self-deception; you
many delay its release, but if it&#8217;s important, it will probably be
stolen sooner or later.
Keeping the source code secret makes financial
sense for proprietary vendors as
a way to encourage customers to buy the products and support,
but it is not a strong security measure.</P

In theory this is true, but the problem is that once someone finds
the vulnerability, the finder may just exploit
the vulnerability instead of helping to fix it.
Having unknown vulnerabilities doesn&#8217;t really make the vulnerabilities go away;
it simply means that the vulnerabilities are a time bomb, with no
way to know when they&#8217;ll be exploited.
Fundamentally, the problem of someone exploiting a vulnerability they
discover is a problem for both open and closed source systems.</P
><P
>One related claim sometimes made
(though not as directly related to OSS/FS)
is that people should not post warnings about
vulnerabilities and discuss them.
This sounds good in theory, but the problem is that attackers already
distribute information about vulnerabilities through a large number
of channels.
In short, such approaches would leave
defenders vulnerable, while doing nothing to inhibit attackers.
In the past, companies actively tried to prevent disclosure of vulnerabilities,
but experience showed that, in general, companies didn&#8217;t fix vulnerabilities
until they were widely known to their users (who could then insist that
the vulnerabilities be fixed).

Trojan horses can be inserted into open source code, true, but they
can also be inserted into proprietary code.
A disgruntled or bribed employee can insert malicious code, and
in many organizations it&#8217;s much less likely to be found than in an
open source program.
After all,
no one outside the organization can review the source code, and few
companies review their code internally (or, even if they do, few can
be assured that the reviewed code is actually what is used).
And the notion that a closed-source company can be sued later has little

>Borland&#8217;s InterBase server is an interesting case in point.
Some time between 1992 and 1994, Borland inserted an intentional
<SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>&#8220;back door&#8221;</SPAN
> into their database server, <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>&#8220;InterBase&#8221;</SPAN
>.
This back door allowed any local or remote user to
manipulate any database object and install arbitrary programs, and
in some cases could lead to controlling the machine as <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>&#8220;root&#8221;</SPAN
>.
This vulnerability stayed in the product for at least 6 years - no one else
could review the product, and Borland had no incentive to remove the
vulnerability.
Then Borland released its source code on July 2000.
The "Firebird" project began working with the source code, and
uncovered this serious security problem
with InterBase in December 2000.
By January 2001 the CERT announced the existence of this back door as
<A
HREF="http://www.cert.org/advisories/CA-2001-01.html"
TARGET="_top"
>CERT
advisory CA-2001-01</A
>.
What&#8217;s discouraging is that the backdoor can be easily found simply by
looking at an ASCII dump of the program (a common cracker trick).
Once this problem was found by open source developers reviewing
the code, it was patched quickly.
You could argue that, by keeping the password unknown,
the program stayed safe, and that opening the source made
the program less secure.
I think this is nonsense, since ASCII dumps are trivial to do and well-known
as a standard attack technique, and not all attackers have sudden
urges to announce vulnerabilities - in fact, there&#8217;s no way to be
certain that this vulnerability has not been exploited many times.
It&#8217;s clear that after the source was opened, the source code was
reviewed over time, and the vulnerabilities found and fixed.
One way to characterize this is to say that the original code was
vulnerable, its vulnerabilities became easier to exploit
when it was first made open source,
and then finally these vulnerabilities were fixed.</P

I personally believe that when a program began as closed source and
is then first made open source, it
often starts less secure for any users (through exposure of
vulnerabilities), and over time (say a few years) it has
the potential to be much more secure than a closed program.
If the program began as open source software, the public scrutiny is
more likely to improve its security before it&#8217;s ready for use by
significant numbers of users, but there are several caveats to this
statement (it&#8217;s not an ironclad rule).
Just making a program open source doesn&#8217;t suddenly make a program secure,
and just because a program is open source does not guarantee security:

><P
>First, people have to actually review the code.
This is one of the key points of debate - will people really
review code in an open source project?
All sorts of factors can reduce the amount of review:
being a niche or rarely-used product (where there are few potential reviewers),
having few developers, and use of a rarely-used computer language.
Clearly, a program that has a single developer and no other contributors
of any kind doesn&#8217;t have this kind of review.
On the other hand, a program that has a primary author and many other
people who occasionally examine the code and contribute suggests that there
are others reviewing the code (at least to create contributions).
In general, if there are more reviewers, there&#8217;s generally a higher likelihood
that someone will identify a flaw - this is the basis of the
<SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>&#8220;many eyeballs&#8221;</SPAN
> theory.
Note that, for example, the OpenBSD project continuously examines
programs for security flaws, so the components in its innermost parts
have certainly undergone a lengthy review.
Since OSS/FS discussions are often held publicly, this level of
review is something that potential users can judge for themselves.</P

>One factor that can particularly reduce review likelihood is not actually
being open source.

Even open source licenses which have unusually

(e.g., TIS&#8217;s Gauntlet) were not, at the time, open source.</P

>Second, at least some of the people developing and
reviewing the code must know how to write secure programs.
Hopefully the existence of this book will help.
Clearly, it doesn&#8217;t matter if there are <SPAN

eyeballs know what to look for.
Note that it&#8217;s not necessary for everyone to know how to write
secure programs, as long as those who do know how are examining the
code changes.</P

>Third, once found, these problems need to be fixed quickly
and their fixes distributed.
Open source systems tend to fix the problems quickly, but the distribution
is not always smooth.
For example, the OpenBSD developers do an excellent job of reviewing code for
security flaws - but they don&#8217;t always report the identified
problems back to the original developer.
Thus, it&#8217;s quite possible for there to be a fixed version in one system,
but for the flaw to remain in another.
I believe this problem is lessening over time, since no one

Of course, ensuring that security patches are actually installed on
end-user systems is a problem for both open source and closed source software.</P

Another advantage of open source is that, if you find a problem, you can
fix it immediately.
This really doesn&#8217;t have any counterpart in closed source.</P

>In short, the effect on security of open source software
is still a major debate in the security community, though a large number
of prominent experts believe that it has great potential to be
more secure.</P
