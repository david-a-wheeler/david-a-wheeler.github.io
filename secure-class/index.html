<h1>Secure Software Design and Programming: Class Materials by David A. Wheeler</h1>

<p>
Here are some of the materials (slides and book) from my
&#8220;Secure Software Design and Programming&#8221; graduate course,
SWE-681/ISA-681, that I have
taught several times at
<a href="http://gmu.edu">George Mason University</a>.
If you&#8217;re interested in the topic, please consider joining us!
</p>

Here are current versions of most of my in-class presentations, released
as open content:
</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="presentations/Secure-Software-1-Introduction.ppt">1 - Introduction</a></li>
<li><a href="presentations/Secure-Software-2-Input-Validation.ppt">2 - Input Validation</a></li>
<li><a href="presentations/Secure-Software-3-Buffer-Overflow.ppt">3 - Low-level attacks (Buffer Overflows and friends)</a></li>
<li><a href="presentations/Secure-Software-4-Design.ppt">4 - Design</a>
<!-- (I plan to add more on threat modeling, attack trees, and CAPEC) -->
</li>
<li><a href="presentations/Secure-Software-5-Call-Out.ppt">5 - Call out to other resources</a></li>
<li><a href="presentations/Secure-Software-6-Output.ppt">6 - Output, Web Applications, Top weakness lists, taxonomies</a></li>
<li><a href="presentations/Secure-Software-7-Cryptography.ppt">7 - Cryptography</a></li>
<li><a href="presentations/Secure-Software-8-Errors.ppt">8 - Error Handling, Resource Handling, Debug Code, and Vulnerable/Obsolete Libraries</a>.
We'll also discuss the
<a href="https://github.com/coreinfrastructure/best-practices-badge/blob/master/doc/security.md">BadgeApp assurance case</a> as an example;
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a5D4d6hcEY">the video
"How to Develop Secure Applications: The BadgeApp Example"</a>
walks through its assurance case.
</li>
<li>
<a href="presentations/Secure-Software-9-Tools.ppt">9 - Analysis tools</a>
</li>
<li>10 - Miscellaneous:
<ul>
<li><a href="presentations/Secure-Software-10-OSS.ppt">Open Source Software</a></li>
<li><a href="presentations/Secure-Software-10-Formal-Methods.ppt">Formal methods</a>.
Formal methods is all about applying mathematics to specifying and/or
proving things about programs (or models of them), so using them
seriously typically requires knowing more about mathematics.
If you want to learn more about mathematics (not required),
you might find this video useful (it is not required viewing): <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZzHxk_TPOStgPtqRZ6KzmkUQBQ8TSWVX">Introduction to Higher Mathematics by Bill Shillito</a>.
</li>
<li><a href="presentations/AI-ML-Security.ppt">Artificial Intelligence / Machine Learning (AI/ML) and Security</a>.
<li><a href="presentations/Secure-Software-10-Misc.ppt">Miscellaneous: Science of Security, Malicious Tools (diverse double-compiling (DDC)), [Are you in] Control, Vulnerability Disclosure</a>.
If you want more information (not required), see <a href="presentations/fully-countering-trusting-trust-ddc-presentation.pdf">Fully countering trusting trust through diverse double-compiling (DDC)</a> [<a href="presentations/fully-countering-trusting-trust-ddc-presentation.odp">ODP</a>] and the

Again, you can view copy of the class version of
&#8220;Secure Programming for Linux and Unix HOWTO&#8221;

(Note that this is not necessarily the same version as posted on my
<a href="secure-programs">secure programming front page</a>.)
</p>

<p>
I talk about tools; here are some other people's short videos
demonstrating some tools:
<ol>
<li><a href="http://security.force.com/security/tools/webapp/zapbrowsersetup">Setting up OWASP ZAP (Zed Attack Proxy)</a>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mjst8fMMnDs">Clang Static Analyzer - gzip (gr33kdude)</a>.
</ol>
</p>

<p>
There's a topic paper in my class,
and I have a number of formatting requirements.
<p>
Here are some templates that implement many formatting requirements,
I suggest using them:
<ul>
<li><a href="template/simple-template.odt">simple-template.odt</a>
<li><a href="template/simple-template.doc">simple-template.doc</a>
<li><a href="template/simple-template.docx">simple-template.docx</a>
<li><a href="template/simple-template.tex">simple-template.tex</a>
</ul>
<p>
As with any formal paper, focus on setting the &#8220;paragraph type&#8221;
of each paragraph correctly.  You should never touch the font name,
font size, or similar properties of ordinary paragraphs if your paper
is longer than a page (aka "direct formatting"); you should only
set those kinds of properties of paragraph types.
Paragraph types are critical to
efficiently writing papers, so you should know how to do that.
If you're manually setting section numbers, or setting font names on
a specific paragraph, you're doing it wrong.

<p>
If you are having trouble coming up with a topic,
here's
<a href="topics.html">a list of some topics that might inspire you</a>.
<a href="https://dwheeler.com/essays/learning-from-disaster.html">Learning
from Disaster</a> might inspire you (or discourage you!).

<p>
Other people have been glad they took this class.
<a href="https://dwheeler.com/blog/2012/05/17/#award-secure-software">I received the &#8220;outstanding adjunct faculty&#8221; award from GMU&#8217;s Department of Computer Science on May 16, 2012, mainly for this class</a>.
One student got a raise, and many have said how rewarding it has been.
This class takes a fair amount of time and effort... but I hope
that you will find that it&#8217;s worth it.
</p>

<p>
Obviously reading the slides is <i>not</i> the same as taking the class!
I offer these slides to the public in case it is helpful to them.

I am adjunct faculty, so it's fine for me to post this.
The GMU "Copyright in University Works"
(University Policy Number 4002) at
http://universitypolicy.gmu.edu/policies/copyright-in-university-works/
includes the following text.  At first you might think I can't do this,
but note that the stronger default limitations do not apply to adjunct
faculty members (like me), so adjunct faculty members
*can* post materials like this:

"b. Course materials.  Course materials in any medium that are prepared by faculty in connection with their academic responsibilities at the university are traditional works as described in Part II (A)(1)(a) and are subject to the provisions of this policy that apply to those works.  Examples of course materials are course notes, course descriptions, outlines, syllabi, reading lists, assignments, examinations, and, for the purpose of this policy, records of the delivery or presentation of the course in any medium.  Course materials created by faculty for additional compensation by the university are considered directed works under Part II (A)(1)(a)(i).

The use outside the university of course materials in which a faculty member holds copyright is subject to the following constraints grounded in considerations of conflict of commitment, conflict of interest, and use of university resources:4

i. Except for adjunct faculty, a faculty member may not, while employed    by the university, use course materials prepared in connection with his or her academic responsibilities at the university for on-line teaching purposes in substantial competition with the university, or make these materials available to others with the intent that they be used for those purposes, without the permission of his or her Dean or Institute Director.  A faculty member may use these        materials or make them available to others for short, not-for-credit courses without obtaining the Dean’s or Director’s permission.
..."


Also, on 2015-01-21 I met with Sanjeev Setia, the chair
of the GMU Computer Science department.
He confirmed that it was fine for me to publicly post these slides.
