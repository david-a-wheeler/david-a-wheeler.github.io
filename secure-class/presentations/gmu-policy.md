> II. Policy Statement, A.  Copyright Ownership, 1. Works Created By Faculty

> a. General provisions.
> It is the policy of the university that the creator of a traditional work holds the copyright in that work, subject to the exceptions described below.[3]  A traditional work is a pedagogical, scholarly, literary, or aesthetic work (including computer software) in any medium that is created by the faculty member within the scope of his or her regular university employment. The university retains a nonexclusive, nontransferable, paid-up license to use faculty-created traditional works for the university’s educational and research purposes, except that the license is revoked if the creator determines that revocation is required by a third party for publication of the work.
>
> The university makes no claim of copyright ownership in works created entirely outside the scope of a faculty member’s employment.

...

> b. Course materials.  Course materials in any medium that are prepared by faculty in connection with their academic responsibilities at the university are traditional works as described in Part II (A)(1)(a) and are subject to the provisions of this policy that apply to those works. Examples of course materials are course notes, course descriptions, outlines, syllabi, reading lists, assignments, examinations, and, for the purpose of this policy, records of the delivery or presentation of the course in any medium. Course materials created by faculty for additional compensation by the university are considered directed works under Part II (A)(1)(a)(i).

> The use outside the university of course materials in which a faculty member holds copyright is subject to the following constraints grounded in considerations of conflict of commitment, conflict of interest, and use of university resources:[4]

> i. Except for adjunct faculty, a faculty member may not, while employed by the university, use course materials prepared in connection with his or her academic responsibilities at the university for on-line teaching purposes in substantial competition with the university, or make these materials available to others with the intent that they be used for those purposes, without the permission of his or her Dean or Institute Director. A faculty member may use these materials or make them available to others for short, not-for-credit courses without obtaining the Dean’s or Director’s permission.

> ii. A faculty member may not use the university’s name, or permit it to be used by others, in connection with the commercial use of course materials for teaching purposes outside the university except to identify the member’s affiliation with the university. Exceptions to this constraint must be approved by the authorized university official.

In general, GMU acknowledges I retain copyright.
In the case of course materials, I (David A. Wheeler) am adjunct faculty,
so under this policy, I am free to make course material available to others.
