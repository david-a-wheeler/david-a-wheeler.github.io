My professional interests focus on
computer security (especially in
<a href="https://dwheeler.com/secure-programs">developing
secure software</a>),
Free/libre/open source software (FLOSS or OSS),
improving software development practices,
and open standards.
I am the Director of Open Source Supply Chain Security at the
Linux Foundation (LF) and an
adjunct professor in the George Mason University (GMU)
Department of Computer Science.

<b>Mentions</b><br>
I've been mentioned way too many times in various news articles and such
to even try to give a complete listing.
Here is a sampler.

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.wired.com/2017/02/despite-trump-silicon-valleys-pentagon-ties-stay-strong/">"Despite Trump, Silicon Valley’s Pentagon Ties Stay Strong", Jeremy Hsu, <i>Wired</i>, 2017-02-10</a>

Shellshock becomes whack-a-mole" (Ars Technica) by Sean Gallagher (2014-09-26)</a> is an article summarizing my statements about the shellshock vulnerability.
<li>I've been thanked by various folks for my suggestions, such as for
<a href="http://www.groklaw.net/article.php?story=20050130002908154">my XML expertise while participating in the development of the Open Document standard</a>, and
by Eric S. Raymond for contributing "many
perceptive criticisms and some case-study material, especially in the design"
in his book
<a href="http://btobsearch.barnesandnoble.com/booksearch/isbninquiry.asp?btob=&amp;ean=9780131429017&amp;TXT=Y&amp;displayonly=PRF">
The Art of Unix Programming</a>.
<li>The article <a href="http://www.linuxpipeline.com/shared/article/printableArticleSrc.jhtml?articleId=60404224">Getting FUD Up? Get The Facts by
Matt McKenzie</a> praises my article
<a href="https://dwheeler.com/oss_fs_why.html">Why Open Source Software / Free Software (OSS/FS)? Look at the Numbers!</a>, saying it's a
"jaw-dropping essay" and is
"the best compilation of [quantitative] data I've ever seen
to support the use of open-source software."
<li><a href="http://www.channelinsider.com/article/HP+Releases+Multilevel+Security+Services+for+RHEL5/218566_1.aspx"> 	
Steven J. Vaughan-Nichols' "HP Releases Multi-level Security Services
for RHEL5" (01-NOV-2007)</a> cites me as an expert on the relationship
between open source software and security.
<li><a href="http://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2006/01/countering_trus.html"> Bruce Schneier's article "Countering 'Trusting Trust'" describes my security
work that counters the "trusting trust" attack</a>.

<p>
<b>Presentations and teaching</b><br>
See my
<a href="https://dwheeler.com/presentations.html">page on presentations</a>
if you want to learn about my past or future public presentations.
I teach part-time at George Mason University, where I'm an
adjunct professor in their
<a href="http://www.cs.gmu.edu/">Department of Computer Science</a>;
if you need to email me in that capacity, use the GMU
address
dwheele4 (at) gmu (dot) edu instead.

<p>
<b>Hobbies/Personal Info</b><br>
My hobbies include tabletop role-playing games (mostly D&amp;D),
chess, singing (bass), and
reading (especially science fiction and fact).
I also play the piano, guitar, tuba, and baritone horn, though
never at the same time.
I live in Northern Virginia, near Washington, DC.
I'm a Christian;
<a href="xian.html">more information about Christianity is available</a>.

<p>
<b>Other Stuff</b><br>
In the mid-1980s I was the maintainer of
<a href="scepter-of-goth/scepter-of-goth.html"><i>Scepter of Goth</i></a>.
This was the first commercial multiplayer Role-Playing Game (RPG)
in the United States; I think it was the first in the world,
though that depends on how you date the
commercialization of Scepter and of Bartle's MUD / British Legends.
This was before Internet access was widespread; Scepter
was a franchise operation, with each franchise running in
a local area (customers would dial into a local franchise).
Scepter has influenced many later systems, including many of the
multi-million-dollar Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Game
(MMORPGs) of today.
I haven't been in that business for many years, but people still remember
me for that.
<p>
For many years I worked at the Institute for Defense Analyses (IDA);
I started as a consultant in 1987, becamae a research staff member (RSM) not
long afterwards, and ended my full-time employment there on 2020-03-31.

<p>
<b>Why the middle initial ("A.")?</b><br>
I always use my middle initial in anything written
(including information on the web), because there are a number of
other David Wheelers.
For example,
David John Wheeler (now deceased) was the creator of the
<a href="http://www.simonshepherd.supanet.com/tea.htm">
Tiny Encryption Algorithm (TEA)</a> (a somewhat popular encryption algorithm
unencumbered by patents), and is credited with
co-inventing the subroutine.
David E. Wheeler is President of Kineticode,
a content management and software development consulting company
based in Portland, and is the
lead developer for Bricolage (an OSS/FS content management system);
you can contact him using the address "david" at justatheory dot com.
<p>
Note: the Associated Press (AP) Style guide recommends that you <i>include</i>
my middle initial in this case.
The
<a href="http://htn.readmedia.com/training-calendar/quick-video-clips/associated-press-style-guide#:~:text=Use%20middle%20initials%20in%20full,the%20person%20uses%20it%20regularly.">AP Style guide says to
"use middle initials in full name reference only
if the person uses it regularly"</a>  - and I
<i>do</i> use my middle initial regularly.
