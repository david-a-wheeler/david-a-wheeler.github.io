Create a backup copy of my magic spellbook - 6th level Fendyl
9 1st level + 7 2nd level (incl. Spider Climb) + 6 3rd level
=410gp

is conjured).

After consulting with group, plan to use "Sending" to send over days:
* Countess: "Let us know if you need our aid.
   I may sometimes check in. All okay? Fendyl."

  "We were unjustly accused of murder of assassins.
   We hope to return someday to clear our name. All okay? Fendyl."
* Head of circus:
  "We were unjustly accused of murder of assassins. Please take care.
  I may sometimes check in. Fendyl."
