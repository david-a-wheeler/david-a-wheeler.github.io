[
The following email messages by Rod Chapman, Praxis, show that
Tokeneer is released under open source software terms.
In short, NSA released the software to Praxis under open source software
terms, and Praxis released it under those same terms to the world.

The "Overview and Reader's Guide", section 2, explains the licensing
terms to the world.  Most of it is covered by this phrase:
"The material generated by Praxis under contract to the NSA
is distributed under the terms of the Technology Transfer Agreement (TTA)
agreed by Praxis and the NSA. A copy of this agreement is
included with (and must always accompany) the release."

The TTA, in turn, says:
"Company shall have a royalty-free, worldwide, non-exclusive, license to
reproduce, prepare derivative works from, distribute, perform, or
display the WORK and to authorize others to do so."
By the above text, Praxis gives others those same rights.
Below are emails that justify this interpretation.

I'm pleased to say that the Tokeneer project material is
now available under an open-source licence granted to Praxis
by the NSA.

Please see

I hope some subset of you find the material useful,
entertaining, or possibly both...

You are correct.

Like I said, that's the intent.
