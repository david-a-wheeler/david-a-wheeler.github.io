<i>This paper identifies
Open Source Software / Free Software (OSS/FS) programs
that I believe are
generally recognized as mature (GRAM), also known as
generally recognized as safe (GRAS)</i>.

<p>
<h1>1. Introduction</h1>
<p>
<a href="oss_fs_refs.html">Open Source Software / Free Software (OSS/FS)</a>
has risen to great prominence.
Briefly, OSS/FS programs are programs whose licenses give
users the freedom to run the program for any purpose,
to study and modify the program, and to redistribute copies of
either the original or modified program (without having to pay
royalties to previous developers).
There is
<a href="http://www.dwheeler.com/oss_fs_why.html">significant evidence
that any user of software should consider using OSS/FS programs</a>, and I've
written a paper on
<a href="http://www.dwheeler.com/oss_fs_eval.html">how to
evaluate OSS/FS programs</a>.

<p>
Unfortunately, OSS/FS is a relatively new concept to many acquirers,
and as a result some acquirers inadvertantly fail to consider OSS/FS options.
Acquirers who have are not looking for their available options will often
be unaware of them, since
OSS/FS projects do not generally have large
marketing campaigns and they ofte do not
respond to government Request for Proposals (RFPs).
OSS/FS distribution processes often make it difficult
to identify their market share, so even widely-used programs can at first
appear to be less common.

<p>
To combat these and other problems,
<a href="http://www.egovos.org/pdf/dodfoss.pdf">a MITRE study recommended
creating a
"generally recognized as safe" (GRAS) list</a> of OSS/FS programs.
Such a list has also been called a
"Generally Recognized as Mature" (GRAM) list, since the issue is one
of maturity, not whether the program will be used in a safety-critical
environment.
Basically, certain OSS/FS programs are so widely used in their market
niche that the risk of using them is significantly reduced, and having
a GRAM or GRAS list would save evaluators time and money.
For example, in web applications the combination of Linux,
Apache, MySQL, and Perl/Python/PHP is so widespread that it has its own
acronym: LAMP.
Clearly, if certain combitations are so widely used that there are
industries and acronyms built on them, they should be considered by
potential users.

<p>
This paper proposes a short GRAM list, that is,
a list of OSS/FS programs that are clearly mature and appropriate
for a wide variety of circumstances.
It is intended for use by acquirers to help them identify
important OSS/FS options they should consider when acquiring software.


<p>
<h1>2. Scope</h1>

<p>
This document does not identify the proprietary software generally
recognized as mature.
Acquisition organizations have far more experience in acquiring
proprietary software, and proprietary software vendors often spend
considerable resources on marketing their software.
Thus, there doesn't seem to be a need for a GRAM list for proprietary software;
certainly the need seems much less pressing.
Given the limited resources available to create a GRAM list,
it appeared appropriate to concentrate on the greatest need:
a GRAM list for OSS/FS software.

<p>
This document only identifies widely-applicable software
(not specialized software).
Also, this document doesn't emphasize infrastructure software;
a typical GNU/Linux or *BSD operating system has many subcomponents, such
as the <a href="http://www.x.org">X window system</a>,
which won't be listed here.

<p>
Even if software is listed on the GRAM list, that
does not necessarily mean that the program is best for a
particular application.
Acquirers must still compare available software to their specific needs.
Conversely, OSS/FS software not on the GRAM list may actually
be more appropriate for a specific unusual application.
See the
<a href="http://www.dwheeler.com/oss_fs_eval.html">companion paper on
how to evaluate OSS/FS programs</a> for more information on
evaluating OSS/FS programs.

<p>
Note that if the OSS/FS programs meets most but not all needs,
the OSS/FS program should still be considered.
One of the hallmarks of OSS/FS programs is flexibility;
OSS/FS programs can be customized to meet a particular need if necessary.
If an OSS/FS program many but not all needs, an acquirer should
examine the pros and cons of modifying the program to meet the
acquirer's needs.
Typically such changes are performed by working with the
existing trusted project developers,
so that the support costs of these program can be transitioned away
from the individual acquirer.

<p>
To be listed on the GRAM list, prospective programs and their projects
must meet certain criteria.
These include significant usage (in their market area),
significant development/support, mature functionality,
security, quality, and cost.
Currently, these attributes have been only considered in an informal way.
Future descendents of this GRAM list may work to
provide more information on these and other important attributes,
possibly using a small team of experts to evaluate GRAM candidates.
I'd certainly love to see a variation of this list that captured
more detailed information (and evidence) for each of these attributes,
as well as a short description of each product, including its strengths /
weaknesses and information useful to potential users
(such as contrasts of various support options).

<p>
The process for evaluating OSS/FS and proprietary software is the same in
a broad way, but they are necessarily different in detail.
For example, it is generally not
possible to examine the source code or developmental discussions
of proprietary software without special arrangements, while that's
possible for OSS/FS projects.
Thus, it would be unsurprising if descendents of this list continued to
concentrate only on OSS/FS programs.
Again, see my related paper on
<a href="http://www.dwheeler.com/oss_fs_eval.html">how to
evaluate OSS/FS programs</a>.


<p>
Many worthy applications are not included in this particular list; there
are so many useful programs that it's essentially impossible
to create a "complete" list.
In particular,
this list includes relatively few libraries; there are so many libraries
available that it's difficult to identify the "important" ones.
Still, I offer it to the world as a short list that may help you if you
are considering using OSS/FS.

<h1>3. Related Work</h1>

I can easily imagine some standards-like group being created
to maintain a GRAM list.
Since at the moment I know of no such organization, perhaps
this list and others will help people until there is such a group.

<p>
Others have also created similar lists, which you may also
find useful:
<ol>
<li>
The Interchange of Data between Administrations (IDA) programme
is managed by the European Commission, with a
mission to "coordinate the establishment of
Trans-European telematic networks between administrations."
IDA has developed
<a href="http://europa.eu.int/ISPO/ida/jsps/index.jsp?fuseAction=showDocument&amp;parent=news&amp;documentID=1647">The IDA Open Source Migration Guidelines</a>
to describe how to migrate from proprietary programs
to OSS/FS programs.
This paper includes a list of suggested OSS/FS programs.
<li>
<a href="http://linuxshop.ru:10000/linuxbegin/win-lin-soft-en/">
The table of equivalents / replacements / analogs of Windows software in Linux
</a>
lists "equivalent" OSS/FS programs to common proprietary programs
that run on GNU/Linux
(however, its listings may be immature or proprietary, since its focus
is different than this paper).
<li>
<a href="http://www.egovos.org/pdf/dodfoss.pdf">The MITRE study</a>
lists programs used in the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD).
Programs that are widespread in the DoD are likely to be mature.
</ol>

<h1>4. GRAM List</h1>

Here is my GRAM list:

<ul>
<li>Operating Systems
<ol>
<li>GNU/Linux - an operating system based on the <a href="http://kernel.org">Linux kernel</a>.  Widely-used distributions include Red Hat Linux, Debian GNU/Linux, SuSE, and MandrakeSoft.
<li>The *BSD Operating systems (<a href="http://www.freebsd.org">FreeBSD</a> (general purpose), <a href="http://www.openbsd.org">OpenBSD</a> (security-focused), <a href="http://www.netbsd.org">NetBSD</a> (portability-focused)).
</ol>

<p>
<li>Network Services
<ol>
<li><a href="http://www.apache.org">Apache (web server)</a>
<li><a href="http://www.isc.org/products/BIND">bind (domain naming service, a critical Internet infrastructure service)</a>
<li><a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/mailman">Mailman (mailing list manager)</a>
<li><a href="http://www.samba.org">Samba (supports interoperability with Windows clients by acting as a Windows file and print server)</a>
<li><a href="http://www.postfix.org">Postfix (email server)</a>
<li><a href="http://www.sendmail.org">Sendmail (email server)</a>. This is the most popular email server in the world.  However, it has had a number of security issues over time; some people use Postfix (also listed here) instead, so
anyone considering Sendmail should also consider Postfix at least
(another widely-used choice is Exim).
</ol>

<p>
<li>Relational Database Management Systems (RDBMSs)
<ol>
<li><a href="http://www.mysql.com">MySQL (database emphasizing speed)</a>
<li><a href="http://www.postgresql.org">PostgreSQL (database emphasizing functionality)</a>
</ol>


<p>
<li>Desktop applications
<ol>
<li><a href="http://ximian.com/products/evolution">Evolution (email client as well as calendar and contact manager)</a>
<li><a href="http://www.mozilla.org">Mozilla (web browser and email client)</a>
<li><a href="http://www.openoffice.org">OpenOffice.org (office suite, including
word processor, spreadsheet, and presentation software)</a>
<li><a href="http://www.gimp.org">The GIMP (bitmapped image editor)</a>
</ol>
<p>
<i>Note</i>: some applications, such as GnuCash (for accounting) and Wine (for
running Windows applications), are well-known but not yet mature at the
time of this writing.
<p>
Note that
<a href="http://www.acmqueue.com/modules.php?name=Content&amp;pa=showpage&amp;pid=55">while there are several OSS/FS office suites available,
Open Office tends to interoperate with Microsoft Office better than the
alternatives</a>, and Open Office supports more platforms than
Gnumeric (a well-respected GNOME spreadsheet program) or KOffice suites.
Note that according to at least one report
<a href="http://www.csdassn.org/software_reports.html">
Gnumeric has more accurate statistical functions than Excel</a>.
I've been pleased when using Abiword, and Abiword <i>does</i> support
many platforms, but note that Abiword is currently intended to be
"lightweight" word processor with fewer features, while many users
want a full-featured word processors.
