	* Fixed an issue thanks to Britton Kerin.
	  He noted that:
	   http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc-4.5.0/gcc/Link-Options.html#Link-Options
	   said that you should use the same options like -fPIC, etc.,
	   if you use -shared.
	* Added a section about GCC 4.5's new -flto option.
	* Fixed more hypertext links, thanks to Britton Kerin
	  who found the updated URLs.

	* Modified Matt's text.

2003-04-11 Matt Domsch <Matt_Domsch, at, Dell.com>
	* Deprecate _init and _fini; instead use
	  __attribute__((constructor)) and __attribute__((destructor))
	  function attributes.

2003-01-02 David A. Wheeler <dwheeler@dwheeler.com>

	* Added information about LSB.

2002-09-09 David A. Wheeler <dwheeler@dwheeler.com>
	* Added reference to "Using ld, the GNU linker"
	  and specifically about version scripts and
	  symbol versioning. Thanks to
	  Erling D. Andersen for suggesting this.

2002-07-01 David A. Wheeler <dwheeler@dwheeler.com>
	* Added note about needing extern "C" in C++ code when
	  calling C, and how to write library headers that are
	  callable from both C and C++ easily.
	  Basic stuff, but I had a report of a problem.
	  Thanks to Nalevajko Tomas for noting this subject
	  (I actually did the writing).

2002-07-01 David A. Wheeler <dwheeler@dwheeler.com>
	* Added cross-references to the ``C++ dlopen mini-HOWTO'' by
	  Aaron Isotton.

2002-03-22 David A. Wheeler <dwheeler@dwheeler.com>
	* Released version 1.00.
	* Added note about -fPIC vs. -fpic, suggested by
	  Hans-Peter Nilsson (thanks!).

2002-02-19 David A. Wheeler <dwheeler@dwheeler.com>
	* By request, added basic info on gcc's -l and -L.

2001-08-17 David A. Wheeler <dwheeler@dwheeler.com>
	* Added discussion on LD_DEBUG

2001-07-30 David A. Wheeler <dwheeler@dwheeler.com>
	* Mentioned "Making C++ Ready for the desktop"

2001-07-24 David A. Wheeler <dwheeler@dwheeler.com>
	* Noted invoking ld-linux.so directly.

2001-05-07 David A. Wheeler <dwheeler@dwheeler.com>
	* Added a note that most programmers should create shared libraries.

2001-03-30 David A. Wheeler <dwheeler@dwheeler.com>
	* Added reference to rpath.

2001-03-22 David A. Wheeler <dwheeler@dwheeler.com>
	* Added discussion on FreeBSD caches (which have different filenames)
	  and modified some text on LD_LIBRARY_PATH.
	* Improved text about the strip(1) command.

2001-03-02 David A. Wheeler <dwheeler@dwheeler.com>
	* Fixed discussion on -Wl,-export-dynamic, and added discussion
	  on how to strip symbol tables.

2000-12-19 David A. Wheeler <dwheeler@dwheeler.com>
	* Noted that the DL search of ld-linux uses /lib, THEN /usr/lib.
	  This is the reverse of the old a.out loader as documented
	  in the ld.so page.  My thanks to Michael Kerrisk who pointed
	  this out and even sent me a test program to demonstrate this
	  (apparantly undocumented) behavior.
	* Made the "id" of the article tag "index", so that the
	  default HTML page is the title page.
	* Added <#include stdlib.h> to silence compiler warnings.
	* Expanded slightly the discussion on ldd -- yes, it really DOES
	  execute the program; I looked at the source code for ldd.
	* Released new version of HOWTO.

2000-11-28 David A. Wheeler <dwheeler@dwheeler.com>
	* Responded to comments by Michael Kerrisk, with some
	  word tweaks and a note that dlclose() returns 0 on success
	  (it returns nonzero on error).  Since the Linux man pages
	  didn't note this, I sent a patch to Andries so the man pages
	  will have this information also.

2000-10-30 David A. Wheeler <dwheeler@dwheeler.com>
	* Added discussion of _init and _fini; this was suggested by
	  Jim Mischel and Tim Gentry, who also sent demo code to show it.

2000-09-14 David A. Wheeler <dwheeler@dwheeler.com>
	* Added reference to "Whirlwind Tutorial on Creating Really
	   Teensy ELF Executables for Linux"

2000-09-06 David A. Wheeler <dwheeler@dwheeler.com>
	* Fixed a typo in the new "C++ binary compatibility" section.

2000-09-06 David A. Wheeler <dwheeler@dwheeler.com>
	* Added information on what breaks binary compatibility in C++
	  (Troll Tech had a list); it's fairly lengthy!
	* Added "id"s to the SGML, so it generates more logical
	  filenames in the HTML.

2000-07-28 David A. Wheeler <dwheeler@dwheeler.com>
	* Added note about other systems not using LD_LIBRARY_PATH.

2000-05-03 David A. Wheeler <dwheeler@dwheeler.com>
	* Fixed minor typo noticed by Ben Cronin.

2000-04-22 David A. Wheeler <dwheeler@dwheeler.com>
