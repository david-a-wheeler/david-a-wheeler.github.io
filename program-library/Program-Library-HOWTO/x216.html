>The nm(1) command can report the list of
symbols in a given library.
It works on both static and shared libraries. 
For a given library nm(1) can list the symbol names defined, each
symbol's value, and the symbol's type.
It can also identify where the symbol was defined in the source code
(by filename and line number), if that information is available in
the library (see the -l option).</P
><P
>The symbol type requires a little more explanation.
The type is displayed as a letter; lowercase means that the symbol is
local, while uppercase means that the symbol is global (external).
Typical symbol types include
T (a normal definition in the code section),
D (initialized data section),
B (uninitialized data section),
U (undefined; the symbol is used by the library
  but not defined by the library), and
W (weak; if another library also defines this symbol, that definition
   overrides this one).</P
><P
>If you know the name of a function, but
you truly can't remember what library it was defined in, you can use
nm's ``-o'' option (which prefixes the filename in each line) along
with grep to find the library name.  From a Bourne shell, you
can search all the libraries in /lib, /usr/lib, direct subdirectories of
/usr/lib, and /usr/local/lib for ``cos'' as follows:

>Library constructor and destructor functions</A
></H2
><P
>Libraries should export initialization and cleanup routines using the
gcc __attribute__((constructor)) and __attribute__((destructor)) function
attributes.  See the gcc info pages for information on these.
Constructor routines are executed before dlopen returns
(or before main() is started if the library is loaded at load time).
Destructor routines are executed before dlclose returns
(or after exit() or completion of main() if the library is loaded at load time).

>Special functions _init and _fini (OBSOLETE/DANGEROUS)</A
></H3
><P
>Historically there have been two special functions, _init and _fini
that can be used to control constructors and destructors.
However, they are obsolete, and their use can lead to unpredicatable results.
Your libraries should not use these;
use the function attributes constructor and destructor above instead.</P
><P
>If you must work with old systems or code that used _init or _fini, here's
how they worked.
Two special functions were defined for initializing and finalizing a module:
_init and _fini.
If a function ``_init'' is exported in a library,
then it is called when the library is first opened
(via dlopen() or simply as a shared library).
In a C program, this just means that you defined some function
named _init.
There is a corresponding function called _fini, which is called whenever a
client finishes using the library
(via a call dlclose() that brings its reference count to zero, or
on normal exit of the program).
The C prototypes for these functions are:
<TABLE
BORDER="0"

><TR
><TD
><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>  void _init(void);
  void _fini(void);</PRE
></TD
></TR
></TABLE
></P
><P
>In this case,
when compiling the file into a ``.o'' file in gcc, be sure to add the
gcc option ``-nostartfiles''.
This keeps the C compiler from
linking the system startup libraries against the .so file.
Otherwise, you'll get a ``multiple-definition'' error.
Note that this is completely different than compiling modules using
the recommended function attributes.
My thanks to Jim Mischel and Tim Gentry for their suggestion to add
this discussion of _init and _fini,
as well as help in creating it.</P

With symbol versioning,
the user can get a warning when they start their program if
the libraries being used with the application are too old.

GNU libtool is a generic library support script.
Libtool hides the complexity of using shared libraries
behind a consistent, portable interface.
Libtool provides portable interfaces to
create object files, link libraries (static and shared), link executables,
debug executables, install libraries, install executables.
It also includes libltdl, a portability wrapper for
dynamically loading programs.

>All the symbols included in generated files are useful for debugging,
but take up space.
If you need space, you can eliminate some of it.</P
><P
>The best approach is to first generate the object files normally,
and do all your debugging and testing first
(debugging and testing is much easier with them).
Afterwards, once you've tested the program thoroughly, use
strip(1) to remove the symbols.
The strip(1) command gives you a good deal of control over
what symbols to eliminate; see its documentation for details.</P
><P
>Another approach is to use the GNU ld options ``-S'' and ``-s'';
``-S'' omits debugger symbol information (but not all symbols)
from the output file, while
``-s'' omits all symbol information from the output  file.
You can invoke these options through gcc as ``-Wl,-S'' and ``-Wl,-s''.
If you always strip the symbols and these options are sufficient, feel
free, but this is a less flexible approach.</P

>It's worth noting that if you're writing a C++ program, and you're
calling a C library function, in your C++ code you'll need to define 
the C function as extern "C".
Otherwise, the linker won't be able to locate the C function.
Internally, C++ compilers ``mangle'' the names of C++ functions
(e.g., for typing purposes), and they need to be told that a given
function should be called as a C function (and thus, not have its
name mangled).</P
><P
>If you're writing a program library that could be called from C or C++,
it's recommended that you include 'extern "C"' commands right in your
header files so that you do this automatically for your users.
When combined with the usual #ifndef at the top of a file to skip
re-executing header files, this means that a typical header file usable
by either C or C++ for some header file foobar.h would look like this:

>GCC 4.5 has added a new optimization option, -flto.
When source files are compiled and linked
using -flto, GCC applies optimizations as if all the source code were in
a single file, which lets it perform far more
aggressive optimizations.
You have to also use an optimization level (-Owhatever).
It obsoletes the old -combine, but you might want to seriously
consider combining it with -fwhole-program.
If you want to do this, you need to
use -flto at all steps of the process, and you should use
exactly the same optimization and machine-dependent options throughout.

Of course, you need to write code that only accesses the standardized
portability layer if you want your code to be portable.
In addition, the LSB provides some tools so that application writers of C/C++
programs can check for LSB compliance; these tools use some capabilities
of the linker and special libraries to do these checks.
Obviously, you'll need to install the tools to do these checks;
you can get them from the LSB website.
Then, simply use the "lsbcc" compiler as your C/C++ compiler
(lsbcc internally creates a linking environment that will complain if
certain LSB rules aren't followed):
<TABLE
BORDER="0"
BGCOLOR="#E0E0E0"
WIDTH="100%"
><TR
><TD
><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
> $ CC=lsbcc make myapplication
  (or)
 $ CC=lsbcc ./configure; make myapplication </PRE
></TD
></TR
></TABLE
>
You can then use the lsbappchk program to ensure that
the program only uses functions standardized by the LSB:
<TABLE
BORDER="0"
BGCOLOR="#E0E0E0"
WIDTH="100%"
><TR
><TD
><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
> $ lsbappchk myapplication</PRE
></TD
></TR
></TABLE
>
You also need to follow the LSB packaging guidelines
(e.g., use RPM v3, use LSB-conforming package names, and
for add-on software must install in /opt by default).
See the article and LSB website for more information.</P
