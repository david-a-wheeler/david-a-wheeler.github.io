>The first two points primarily protect me from repeatedly hearing about
obsolete bugs.
I do not want to hear about bugs I fixed a year ago, just because you
are not properly mirroring the document.
By linking to the master site,
users can check and see if your mirror is up-to-date.
I'm sensitive to the problems of sites which have very
strong security requirements and therefore cannot risk normal
connections to the Internet; if that describes your situation,
at least try to meet the other points
and try to occasionally sneakernet updates into your environment.</P

>By this license, you may modify the document,
but you can't claim that what you didn't write is yours (i.e., plagiarism)
nor can you pretend that a modified version is identical to
the original work.
Modifying the work does not transfer copyright of the entire work to you;
this is not a ``public domain'' work in terms of copyright law.
See the license for details, in particular noting that
``You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.''
If you have questions about what the license allows, please contact me.
In most cases, it's better if you send your changes to the master
integrator (currently David A. Wheeler), so that your changes will be
integrated with everyone else's changes into the master copy.</P
