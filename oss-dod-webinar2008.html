Open Source Software (OSS) and the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) - Webinar</font></center></h1>
<p>
On Feb 11, 2008, 3:00-4:30pm EST, David A. Wheeler presented on
"Open Source Software and the DoD".
It was open to the public, at no charge.
This presentation was hosted by the
<a href="https://www.thedacs.com/">
Data &amp; Analysis Center for Software (DACS)</a>, which
is technically managed by the
Air Force Research Laboratory - Information Directorate (AFRL/IF). 
<p>
Summary:
"Open source software (OSS) has become widespread, but there are many
misconceptions about it - resulting in numerous missed opportunities.
This presentation will clarify what OSS is (and isn't),
rebut common misunderstandings about OSS, discuss the relationship
of OSS and security, discuss how to find and evaluate OSS,
and explain OSS licensing (including how to
combine products and select a license).
It will show why nearly all extant OSS is COTS software, and
thus why it's illegal (as well as foolish) to ignore OSS options."

A number of questions were asked during the presentation;
<a href="http://dwheeler.com/essays/dod-oss-qa.html">here
are my attempts to answer those questions about OSS and DoD</a>.
<p>
DACS has informed me that "about 200 registered
people [attended].  This means that more than that actually attended given
some people will run this in a conference room."
<!-- There were at least 168 participants (exact count to come). -->
