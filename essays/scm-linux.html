<h1>Linux kernel requirements for Software Configuration Management
(SCM) tools</h1>
In April 2005, Linus Torvalds announced that he would no longer use
BitMover's BitKeeper as an SCM tool, and that he was investigating his
alternatives.  Since that time, there have been many discussions on what
the requirements of that new tool should be.
<p>
Torvalds and others have been working on a tool named "git", which
is at least a current stand-in, and may grow into the SCM tool he uses.
For more information on git, see
<a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/131657/">the guts of git</a>,
the <a href="http://vger.kernel.org/vger-lists.html#git">git mailing list</a>,
and the
<a href="http://pasky.or.cz/~pasky/dev/git/">pasky git distribution site</a>
(here's the
<a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/131312/">original announcement of git</a>).
<p>
This article summarizes some of the SCM tool requirements that have
been implied, mentioned, or discussed.  It's primarily from the Linux
kernel mailing list; it's not a complete list, and there are probably
mistakes here too.  But I suspect many will find this summary helpful.
This article is intended for Linux kernel developers (who may note
additional requirements) and for SCM tool developers (who can adjust
their tools to better meet these requirements.  Meeting this set does not
guarantee that the SCM tool will be selected by the kernel developers;
the kernel developers will decide what tools they'll use.
<p>
So, here's a short list:
<ol>
<li>Available May through June 2005.  (Torvalds said "1-2 months").
<li>Open Source Software / Free Software (OSS/FS).  Some kernel developers
don't care if the tool is OSS/FS, but others passionately do.
<li>Distributed SCM (<i>not</i> a centralized SCM).  Developers need to
be able to work independently, and then push/pull their work to others.
??? See subversion URL.
<li>Key operations must be very fast at the (large) scale of the Linux
kernel.  These should be O(1) compared to the number of previous patches.
These key operations arecheck-in and check-out (locally) include show
differences with a previous version, and accepting patches/merges
(Torvalds has to process a tremendous number of patches).
<li>Storage and exchange formats should be be very simply, maximizing
the use of existing tools. For example, see Torvalds' "git" -- it stores
files as constant values (so rsync can be used), gzip compression, sha1sum
for SHA-1.  ASCII representations and standard formats are a big plus.
<li>Integrity and data recovery mechanisms are <i>critical</i>.  Data loss
is horrific and needs to be minimized -- include some redundancy so that
if things go terribly wrong, at least some data can be recovered. E.G.,
"git" stores some header information so that trees can be reconstructed.
<li>Storage is cheap, so feel free to waste some local space to meet other
requirements. Network bandwidth is not cheap, however; approaches need to
not be bandwidth hogs. And if you can reduce storage requirements easily,
that's good.
<li>
Require cryptographic signatures of results only when you're "done",
not for intermediate check-ins (this is an issue with Monotone).
<li>
Must be able to "throw away"  local branches if they turn out to  be
ineffective.  Sometimes you start an approach and it just turns out to
be useless.
<li>
Support easily reordering/reorganizing patches locally, and splitting
changes into multiple trees that can be separately pulled.  In short,
make sure that it's easy for developers to export trees  that are "clean".
Earlier on, cherry-picking was considered important to the developers.
This has turned out to be less important, because downstream integrators
who start cherry-picking find management too hard.  It's better to insist
that upstream developers create clean trees, and help those developers
create the clean trees. This distributes the problem of creating clean
trees, than requiring the central integrators to try to "clean up"
trees later.
<li>
Make it easy to post changed trees, list the changes available but not
yet pulled, and easily pull changes.
<li>
Annotation / blame doesn't need to be fast. It's a relatively rare
operation.
