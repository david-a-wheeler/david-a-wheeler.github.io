<p>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Hail_Mary"
><i>Project Hail Mary</i></a> is a 2021 science fiction novel by
Andy Weir - and a really good one.
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/StarForce:_Alpha_Centauri"
>StarForce: Alpha Centauri</a>
is a board game published in 1974 by Simulations Publications Inc. (SPI).
Here I'm going to show how the stars noted in the novel map to the
StarForce game board.

<p>
StarForce is unusual board wargame, and not just because it's science fiction.
Its game map is a three-dimensional volume of space within
20 light years of Earth, with star positions based on actual astronomical
positions.
The game map implements 3D via a hex map
where each hex represents a one light year volume, Sol (our star)
is at the center, and positions are identified by a 4-digit 2D position,
a slash, and a number indicating the number of light-years above or below
a plane going through Sol.
Redmond Simonsen, designer of StarForce, said that
"There were a couple of
liberties taken with the positions of some
stars, but, by and large, the map is pretty accurate astronomically.
There are a few stars a couple of light years out of line."
[<a href="https://www.spigames.net/MovesScans/Moves21/SFTapes.pdf"
>THE STARFORCE TAPES:
A Three Way Discussion of the Design and Rationale of StarForce</a>].
So while it's not 100% accurate, it's unusually accurate and its simple
map makes it easy to see relative positions of stars in a way that isn't
normally accessible to the public.

<p>
The novel mentions a number of stars relatively near Earth,
and it turns out you can find almost all of them on the StarForce game map.
Here we'll look at important aspects of the novel through the lens of the
StarForce game map.
<p>
Spoilers for the novel <i>Project Hail Mary</i> ahead!
<p>
As you follow the plot, it's eventually revealed that Tau Ceti
is the origin of Astrophage.
On page 95-96 of the hardcover 2021 release, it's revealed that
astrophage spread as follows, and here I provide their
StarForce coordinates:

<ul>
<li>Tau Ceti, StarForce coordinates <tt>3015/-3</tt>
<li>Epsilon Eridani, StarForce coordinates <tt>2713/-2</tt>
<li>Sirius, StarForce coordinates <tt>1812/-2</tt>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WISE_0855%E2%88%920714"
>WISE 0855-0714</a>.
This is <i>not</i> on the
StarForce map; this object was discovered in April 2014, and the
game (with its map) is copyright 1974
<li>Sol (our star), StarForce coordinates <tt>2020/0</tt>
</ul>

<p>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WISE_0855%E2%88%920714"
>WISE 0855-0714</a>
(full designation WISE J085510.83-071442.5)
might not have been put on the StarForce map even if it had been
known at the time the map was created.
This stellar object is relatively close (only 7.43 light-years away),
but it's estimated to only have a mass of
3-10 Jupiter masses (M<sub>J</sub>).
That mass is below the minimum (limiting) mass for thermonuclear
fusion of deuterium of about 13 Jupiter masses, making it a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sub-brown_dwarf"
>sub-brown dwarf</a>.
Its temperature is not like a star either: -48 to -13 °C (-55 to 8 °F).
In short, it's more like a heavy rogue planet rather than
a star in the usual sense.

<p>
The novel never says astrophage spread from Tau Ceti <i>directly</i> to
Epsilon Eridani, so in theory there could have been an intermediary.
However, a look at the StarForce map shows that these two stars
are relatively close together, so direct transmission
is by far the most likely scenario.

<p>
The novel mentions that at least 3 stars were infected by
WISE 0855-0714:

<ul>
<li>Wolf 354, StarForce coordinates <tt>1319/+1</tt>
<li>Lalande 21185, StarForce coordinates <tt>1418/+5</tt>
<li>Ross 128, StarForce coordinates <tt>0920/0</tt>
</ul>

<p>
Rocky and the other Eridians come from
40 Eridani, StarForce coordinates <tt>2707/-2</tt>.
The StarForce coordinates of 40 Eridani and Tau Ceti are 10 light-years apart,
and if that's accurate, that is larger than the
8 light-year transmission range of astrophage.
An especially likely transmission route,
if we just look at the StarForce map, is
from Tau Ceti (<tt>3015/-3</tt>) to
Epsilon Eridani (<tt>2713/-2</tt>) to
40 Eridani (<tt>2707/-2</tt>).
Since Sol also eventually became infected through Epsilon Eridani, this
suggests that 40 Eridani would probably have become infected first, long
before Sol.
That placement is consistent with the novel's plot, where Rocky arrives first
even though Earthlings have somewhat more advanced technology,
detect the problem on Sol quickly, and
build a spaceship relatively rapidly.
It's impressive to see the care that went into making this story
given what we know at the time of its writing.

<p>
<a href="http://www.atlasoftheuniverse.com/20lys.html"
>Stars within 20 light years</a>
tries to show similar information to the StarForce map,
focusing on accuracy.

<p>
In sum: we can find <i>all</i> of the stars in the novel on this
1974 game's map, with the exception of
WISE 0855-017 - which was only discovered in April 2014.
I think that's pretty neat.
