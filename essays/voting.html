its voting system.
Stuffing ballot boxes isn't new, but now we have a high-tech way to
control every ballot box in a country: electronic voting machines.

is hard to to do undetected; changing an electronic value to a "desirable"
value can be done by one person.
And given some of today's elecronic voting sytsems, it's impossible
to detect.
