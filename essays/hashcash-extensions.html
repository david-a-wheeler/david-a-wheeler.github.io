Mailing list issue - two possible solutions.
One - include 'from' and/or 'subject' (extension).
Issue - can't precache 'subject', but CAN precache with 'from'.

Two - send email separately to receiver, so can initialize as
a 'safe' recipient.  Only do so if the original sender sent a
hashcash value, and only do so for the same number of bits.


Countering spam will require a set of measures, not a single measure,
but a set of measures working together can really be effective.
A recipient will need to examine each message in turn, and consider
all the evidence available to determine if a given message should be
accepted.
Hashcash is especially helpful in giving evidence that a given
stranger is okay, since it makes it harder for a spammer to create
that evidence.

Thus, hashcash should include a larger 'payment' for
the first message to a given recipient (at least, the first one
for a period of time such as several months).

Recipients could cache previously-okay messages (including anyone that
messages were sent to), and whitelist (or at least lower the spam
probability) from previous recipients.
SPF etc. help make it so the whitelist isn't as risky.
