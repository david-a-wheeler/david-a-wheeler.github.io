This page is a collection of short random opinions and links.
I once had an essay about spam here; please see my separate

<b>GNU/Linux vs. *BSDs</b>
Why does GNU/Linux get more wide use and press than the OSS/FS *BSDs
(OpenBSD, NetBSD, FreeBSD)?
After all, the *BSDs came first, are quite capable (I use OpenBSD sometimes),
and assert that they are "more commercial friendly" because their
licenses permit almost any use (while Linux's GPL license forbids certain
activities).
I think there are two reasons: the GPL license, and the bazaar model
followed by Torvalds.
The GPL license basically eliminates any economic reasons to "fork" the
kernel.
A GNU/Linux distributor can take an extension of the kernel from a competitor
and use it him or herself, so there's no advantage to "hoarding" improvements.
Obviously, there are multiple GNU/Linux distributors, but their underpinnings
(the kernel, C library, etc.) are actually far more similar than different.
Distributions do differ in things like file locations, but it's easier to
account for this difference than fundamental differences in APIs.
Also, the *BSDs have historically followed the "Cathedral" approach;
they produce fine products, but without supporting hardware
many people want.
Basically, both the GPL (which forces people to work together) and
the bazaar (which allows large numbers of people to work together) have
enable GNU/Linux to have a larger development velocity than its competitors.
I doubt that the *BSDs will disappear; if nothing else, most of the work
in a GNU/Linux system works just as well on a BSD system, so they
need not fall far behind.
Apple's MacOS is now based on a *BSD, though it should
be noted that an entire
Apple system is proprietary too and thus doesn't have the end-user
advantages of a fully OSS/FS system.

<b>Rsync</b>.
<a href="http://rsync.samba.org">Rsync</a>
is a tremendous program and is great for managing websites.
Rsync can copy a tree of files from one place
to another, cleverly reducing the amount of data it actually sends
over the network while accurately handling symbolic links, timestamps,
and so on.
Combine it with openssh, and you can update a tree of files securely.
I manage a website by modifying a local setup until I like the result, and
then use rsync to update the real website.
I also watch so I can see if anyone has mucked with my real website's
contents - it hasn't happened yet.
But even if someone modified the data contents of the website,
I can restore the website quickly once I regain control over it.
Here's the command line for a typical update:
<pre>
  rsync -Cazv --rsh="ssh" source/ name@destination:/destination_path
</pre>
