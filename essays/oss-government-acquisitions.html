<p>Open source software (OSS) is one of
the most important trends in commercial information technology (IT),
yet it&rsquo;s still widely misunderstood.  This article explains
what OSS is, why essentially all extant OSS is commercial
off-the-shelf (COTS) software, how it&rsquo;s developed, and how it
can be applied to U.S. government acquisitions.</p>
<h1>What is OSS?</h1>
<p><a href="http://www.opensource.org/docs/definition.php">
Open Source Software (OSS)</a> is simply software
that is licensed to users with the following freedoms:</p>
<ul>
<li>To run the software for any purpose;
<li>To study and modify the software; and
<li>To freely redistribute copies of either the original or modified
software without royalty payments or other restrictions on
who can receive them.
</ul>
<p>Common synonyms
include &ldquo;libre software&rdquo;,
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html">&ldquo;Free software&rdquo;</a> (sic),
&ldquo;Free / open source software&rdquo; (FOSS),
and &ldquo;Free-libre / open source software&rdquo; (FLOSS). 
Many use the older term &ldquo;Free software&rdquo; to emphasize
user freedom, but many avoid that term because it&rsquo;s often
misunderstood as meaning &ldquo;no cost&rdquo; (which is <i>not</i>
the intended meaning).  OSS is <i>not</i> free of cost when
considering the total cost of ownership (TCO), but an OSS approach
<i>may</i> have the lowest TCO for a particular situation.  Common
antonyms of OSS include &ldquo;proprietary software&rdquo; and
&ldquo;closed software&rdquo;.</p>
<p>OSS is widely used. 
OSS programs lead or have significant market share in many markets,
such as web servers (Apache), web browsers (Mozilla Firefox), email
servers (Sendmail), DNS servers (bind), server operating systems
(GNU/Linux), C/C++ compilers (gcc), Ada compilers (GNAT), and so on.
A 2003 MITRE report noted that OSS &ldquo;plays a more critical
role in the [Department of Defense (DoD)]
than has generally been recognized.&rdquo;
<a href="http://www.terrybollinger.com/dodfoss/dodfoss_pdf_hyperlinked.pdf">
[MITRE2003]</a>  Many quantitative studies have found that some OSS
programs do as well or better than their proprietary competitors by
various measures
<a href="https://dwheeler.com/oss_fs_why.html">[Wheeler2007]</a>.</p>
<h1>Pre-existing OSS is Commercial Off-the-Shelf (COTS)</h1>
<p>With almost no
exceptions, extant OSS is commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) software. 
The fact that nearly all extant OSS is commercial, or COTS, can be
proven from a variety of viewpoints.</p>
<p>For example, most
extant OSS is COTS because U.S. acquisition law and its
derivative Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) define it as such. 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/41/usc_sec_41_00000403----000-.html">
U.S. Code Title 41, Chapter 7, section 403</a>, and the corresponding
<a href="http://www.acquisition.gov/far/current/html/Subpart%202_1.html#wp1145508">
FAR text (2.101)</a> define a &ldquo;commercial item&rdquo; as an item
&ldquo;customarily used by the general public or by non-governmental
entities&rdquo; (i.e., they have uses not unique to a government)
and have been &ldquo;sold, leased, or <i>licensed</i> to the general
public&rdquo;, or at least &ldquo;offered for sale, lease, or
<i>license</i> to the general public&rdquo;.
That means that nearly all extant OSS
is a commercial item, because nearly all extant OSS is licensed to the
general public and have uses not unique to a government.
What's more,
extant OSS is off-the-shelf (OTS), and since nearly all extant OSS
are commercial items,
nearly all extant OSS is commercial off-the-shelf (COTS).
OSS can even have modifications of a type
customarily available in the commercial marketplace, or have minor
modifications made to meet federal government requirements, and
still be considered a commercial item.
The
<a href="http://oss-institute.org/Navy/DONCIO_OSS_User_Guidance.pdf">
U.S. Navy&rsquo;s June 5, 2007 memo
&ldquo;Department of the Navy Open Source Software
Guidance&rdquo;</a> specifically affirms this understanding.</p>

<p>This is important in
U.S. government acquisitions because the FAR (including the DoD
implementation, the DFARS) have far-reaching requirements about
commercial items.  The FAR requires government agencies to &ldquo;(a)
Conduct market research to determine [if] commercial items or
non-developmental items are available &hellip; (b) Acquire [them]
when&hellip; available &hellip; [and] (c) Require prime contractors
and subcontractors at all tiers to incorporate, to the maximum
extent practicable, [them] as components...&rdquo;.  An agency that
fails to consider OSS options is in direct violation of the FAR,
because it would be failing to consider commercial items.</p>
<p>Another reason that
most extant OSS is commercial is because U.S. copyright law says so.
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode17/usc_sec_17_00000101----000-.html">
U.S. Code Title 17, section 101</a> defines &ldquo;financial gain&rdquo;
as including &ldquo;receipt, or expectation of receipt, of anything
of value, including the receipt of other copyrighted works.&rdquo; 
Most OSS projects are specifically established to encourage others
to contribute improvements (which are copyrighted works), a form of
financial gain and thus commercial.</p>
<p>Today it is even more
obvious that OSS is increasingly commercial.  Commercial companies
that directly support OSS projects include IBM, Sun, Red Hat,
Novell, and Microsoft &ndash; in all cases to improve their profits.
Microsoft is a particularly interesting case in point; it fights
against OSS projects that compete with its own products (e.g.,
GNU/Linux), of course, but Microsoft also directly sponsors OSS
projects (such as WiX and IronPython) and even its own OSS website
(Codeplex) when the OSS projects aid their bottom line.  In 2004,
Andrew Morton noted that 37,000 of the last 38,000 changes to the
Linux kernel were made by developers <i>paid</i> to do so.</p>
<p>Many OSS projects
specifically welcome commercial sponsorship.  Indeed, the two most
popular &ldquo;formal&rdquo; definitions of OSS &ndash; the
<a href="http://www.opensource.org/docs/definition.php">
&ldquo;Open Source Definition&rdquo;</a>
and the
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html">
&ldquo;Free Software Definition&rdquo;</a>
&ndash; both specifically note that commercial use and development
of OSS is welcome and encouraged.</p>

on why most extant OSS is COTS, see:
<a href="https://dwheeler.com/essays/commercial-floss.html">https://dwheeler.com/essays/commercial-floss.html</a>.</p>
<p>OSS approaches work
because they enable a large number of users to pool their resources,
lowering the development and maintenance costs for end-users.  This
is also true for proprietary software approaches, but OSS projects
typically spread these costs in a very different manner.  To
understand this, we need to examine how OSS is typically developed.</p>
<h1>How is OSS Typically Developed?</h1>
<p>Figure 1 shows a
development model for a typical OSS project, which may help dispel
misunderstandings.  Key to understanding OSS development is that
most OSS projects have a &ldquo;trusted repository&rdquo;, that is,
some (web) location where people can get the &ldquo;official&rdquo;
version of the program, as well as related information
(documentation, bug report system, mailing lists, etc.).  Users can
get their software directly from the trusted repository, or get it
through distributors who acquire it (and provide additional value
such as integration with other components, testing, special
configuration, support, and so on).</p>
<p>Only some developers
are allowed to modify the trusted repository directly: the trusted
developers.  At project start, the project creators (who create the
initial trusted repository) are the trusted developers, and they
determine who else may become a trusted developer of this initial
trusted repository.  All other developers can make changes to their
local copies, and even post their versions to the Internet
(a process made easy by distributed software configuration management tools),
but they must submit their changes to a trusted developer to get their
changes into the trusted repository.</p>
<p><br>
</p>
<center>
<img src="oss-development-model.png" width="778" height="384" alt="OSS Development Model: Source Code flows through developer, trusted developer, trusted repository, distributor, and finally to user; user can send bug reports and even source code back up">
<p><font size="+1"><b>Figure 1: Typical OSS Development Model</b></font></p>
</center>
<p><br>
</p>
<p>Users can send bug
reports to the distributor or trusted repository, just as they could
for a proprietary program.  But what is radically different is that
a user can actually make a <i>change</i> to the program itself
(either directly, or by hiring someone to do it).  Since users will
want to use the improvements made by others, they have a strong
financial incentive to submit their improvements to the trusted
repository.  That way, their improvements will be merged with the
improvements of others, enabling them to use <i>all</i> improvements
instead of only their own.</p>
<p>This can create an
avalanche-like &ldquo;virtuous cycle&rdquo;.  As the program becomes
more capable, more users are attracted to using it.  A very small
percentage of such users determine that they can make a change
valuable to them, and contribute it back (to avoid maintenance
costs).  As more improvements are made, more people can use the
product, creating more potential users as developers - like a
snowball that gains mass as it rolls downhill.</p>
<p>This cost-sharing is
rather different than proprietary development, because the costs
born by a particular organization are typically only those for
whatever <i>improvements</i> or <i>services</i> are used. In
contrast, typical proprietary software costs are per-seat, not
per-improvement or service.  To many the proprietary software
business model is more comfortable, because it is more familiar, but
it must be noted that the OSS model is much more reflective of
<i>actual costs</i> borne by development organizations.  It costs
essentially nothing to send a file or burn a CD-ROM of software;
once it exists, all software costs are due to maintenance
and support of software.
In short, OSS more accurately reflects the economics of software
development.
I speculate that this is one reason why OSS has become so common so
quickly.</p>
<h1>Why Would Governments Use or Create OSS in their Acquisitions?</h1>
<p>Why would a government
be interested in using or creating OSS in government acquisitions? 
Most reasons simply flow from the definition of OSS:</p>
<ol>
<li>Use: Governments can use OSS for any purpose it sees fit.
<li>Study: Governments can evaluate a program in detail, which lowers
their risk.  They can see if the software meets their security needs, look
for spyware or trapdoors, and so on.  Where mass peer review
occurs, quality and security of the result greatly increases.  This
also aids government record longevity and government transparency
because the data formats are not secret.
<li>Modify: Governments can modify the software for special needs (increasing
government flexibility) and to counter attack.
<li>Redistribute:  Government can copy the software repeatedly, lowering TCO.
Support may have per-use costs, but OSS support can be meaningfully competed.
</ol>
<p>OSS development
processes are all about cost-sharing.  While the details are
different than in proprietary development, both OSS and proprietary
models provide a way for organizations to pool their resources so
that each receives a product for far less cost than if they had
developed it on their own for their sole use.  OSS projects are
essentially consortia, and the reasons one might start or join a
consortia also apply to starting or joining an OSS project. 
</p>
<p>In a broader sense,
OSS presents governments with the promise of <i>controlling their
own destiny</i>: freedom from vendor lock-in, vendor abandonment,
and conflicting vendor goals.  In short, OSS approaches have the
potential in many cases to increase functionality, quality, and
flexibility, while lowering cost and development time.  Some
governments are even applying OSS more widely, as a way for their
countries to gain independence from foreign suppliers, but I will
not address that further in this article.  But the potential of OSS,
even when more narrowly considered, can sometimes be difficult to
realize.</p>
<h1>OSS Challenges</h1>
<p>Applying OSS can
sometimes be a challenge in U.S. government acquisitions.</p>
<p>One of the biggest
problems today is simply ensuring that OSS is fairly considered in
government acquisitions at all.  Some acquisition processes or
policies have not been updated for OSS; many processes implicitly
presume that all COTS software is proprietary software. 
Alternatively, many U.S. government organizations fail to follow
appropriate policies.  For example, the FAR is very clear that
market research of commercial items is required, and both the U.S.
and DoD  have issued policy memos stating that they are &ldquo;OSS
neutral&rdquo;, yet many U.S. government organizations still fail to
even consider OSS solutions.  In part, this is because many program
managers (PMs) are unfamiliar with OSS, and so are unable to ask the
right questions.  Many COTS OSS projects ignore solicitations &amp;
RFPs, so a program cannot simply issue an RFP and expect that all
reasonable options will participate (which is why failure to follow
the FAR policy for market research is such a serious problem).</p>
<p>Another yet related
challenge is that OSS has a fundamentally different economic model. 
In OSS, users primarily pay-up-front for improvements, as well as
paying for whatever services they wish.  This is fundamentally
different than most proprietary COTS&rsquo; pay-per-use model. 
There is flexibility: For OSS projects, payment can be in money or
time, it can be competed, and costs can be shared with others.  But
it is still a different cost model, one that requires rethinking old
assumptions and searching for opportunities, not fleeing from
change.</p>
<p>Another difficult
challenge is transition costs if there is a pre-existing system,
<i>especially</i> if that system is dependent on proprietary
formats, protocols, or application programmer interfaces (APIs). 
All too often an alternative system (OSS or not) will have a
radically smaller TCO, yet will not be used because of significant
transition costs.  The solution is to transition to open
architectures based on <a href="http://www.digistan.org/open-standard:definition">fully open standards</a>.
Such standards are
truly supported by multiple vendors and do not include legal traps
that inhibit full and open competition, such as misleadingly named
&ldquo;reasonable and non-discriminatory&rdquo; (&ldquo;RAND&rdquo;)
patents that actually prohibit most OSS implementation.  Using
web-based applications, including service-oriented architectures
(SOAs), can help as long as they are based on open standards so that
they are neutral to the web browsers, servers, and underlying
platforms used.  Note, however, that vendor lock-in often increases
TCO over time - so much so that even high transition costs may be
worthwhile.</p>
<p>Other claimed
&ldquo;challenges&rdquo; usually turn out to be non-problems:</p>
<ul>
<li>
What about support if there&rsquo;s no traditional vendor? 
Increasingly traditional support vendors have become available for
important OSS projects.  Regardless of their presence, this need
can be competed traditionally, so it&rsquo;s not a real
problem&mdash;just a perceived one.
<li>
What about license compliance?  Complying with OSS licenses is
often easier, because OSS licenses specifically permit activities
that proprietary licenses usually forbid.  In particular, you can
make as many copies of OSS software as you like, study it, and
modify it, all activities typically forbidden by proprietary
licenses.  However, if you do choose to incorporate OSS software
into a larger system, there are typically some requirements
(depending on the license).  These would only apply in cases where
you would have to receive permission from a proprietary vendor anyway.
The primary problem appears to be a lack of education; PMs
and developers must learn about OSS licenses so they can apply
them. About five OSS licenses account for nearly all OSS software, so
concentrating on them would be sufficient for many purposes.
Those licenses are fairly straightforward,
<a href="https://dwheeler.com/essays/floss-license-slide.html">allow for combinations</a>, and have
have relatively few conditions (compared to proprietary licenses).
Thus, it typically takes only 10-20 minutes to get a
basic education about the top five OSS licenses.
<li>
What about using OSS in classified code?  Obviously, you cannot
release classified software to the general public!  You can
certainly build classified systems with or including OSS; many
classified systems today include or are developed using OSS
programs such as the Linux kernel, GNAT, gcc, and so on.  Some
widely-used licenses, such as the GNU General Public License (GPL),
impose limitations that must be respected, but it turns out that
classified systems can often be developed using them while still
obeying these licenses.  In particular, systems can often be
designed using layers or data tables so that the classified
components/data are cleanly and completely separated from the
unclassified components/data.  This is wise to do anyway, because
such separation greatly decreases development and testing costs
even when not required by a license.  Of course, not all OSS
programs use the GPL, and/or some developers are willing to grant
exceptions, so even when separation cannot occur, it may still be
possible to use OSS.
</ul>
<h1>OSS Use in the U.S. Government</h1>
<p>OSS use in U.S.
government is pervasive.  MITRE noted the DoD&rsquo;s widespread use
of OSS, including the Linux kernel, Samba, Apache, Perl, GCC, GNAT,
XFree86, OpenSSH, bind, and sendmail.  Reasons aren&rsquo;t
difficult to find; for example, government contractor devIS reports
that it &ldquo;saves its clients a minimum of $100,000 per contract
by using OSS&rdquo;
<a href="http://www.newsforge.com/business/03/01/28/1829254.shtml">
[Miller2003a]</a>.  Indeed, government users are
often unaware when a program they are using is OSS.</p>
<p>The U.S. federal
government has also paid for improvements to OSS when it&rsquo;s in
its interests to do so (demonstrating the transition from user to
co-developer).  These include Bind (to add DNSSEC support), OpenSSL
(for a FIPS cryptographic evaluation), GNAT (to implement Ada
support in gcc), BSD TCP/IP suite implementation, and Linux (via
Security-Enhanced Linux, aka SELinux).</p>
<p>In some cases U.S.
governments have even started whole OSS projects when it was in
their interest to do so; examples include OpenVista, Expect, and
EZRO.  The U.S. state of Georgia started the OSS &ldquo;Evergreen&rdquo;
project after determining that existing commercial products were
grossly inadequate; its OSS approach has been very successful 
<a href="http://www.linux.com/article.pl?sid=06/12/04/1538214">
[Stutz2006]</a>.</p>
<p>U.S. federal policies
are explicitly neutral about using OSS or proprietary software: Both
<a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/memoranda/fy04/m04-16.html">
OMB memo M-04-16</a> and the
<!_-- old: http://www.egovos.org/rawmedia_repository/822a91d2_fc51_4e6e_8120_1c2d4d88fa06?/document.pdf -->
<a href="http://iase.disa.mil/policy-guidance/oss-in-dodmemo.pdf">DoD memo &ldquo;OSS in DoD&rdquo;</a>
make it quite clear that OSS and non-OSS software are equally
acceptable, and do not
impose any specific license requirements (e.g., they do not forbid
or inhibit use of the GPL, the most popular OSS license).</p>
<h1>Selecting COTS OSS</h1>
<p>There are two kinds of COTS software:
Proprietary COTS software and OSS COTS software.  In many ways you
evaluate software the same way.  Negotiate your best options with
all parties, then select the best one.  Evaluate them by winnowing
out top candidates for your needs, through the typical process of
identifying candidates, reading reviews, comparing (briefly) to
needs through criteria, and then analyzing top candidates.  Your
evaluation criteria will generally be the same: Functionality, total
cost of ownership (TCO), support, maintenance/ longevity,
reliability, performance, scalability, flexibility, legal/license
(including rights and responsibilities), market share, and so on
(see <a href="https://dwheeler.com/oss_fs_eval.html">https://dwheeler.com/oss_fs_eval.html</a>).</p>
<p>They have many of the
same issues:</p>
<ul>
<li>
Be sure your TCO calculations include all costs over the entire
usage period.  Nothing is truly free of cost; there is always a
cost for installation, training, support, and so on.  Proprietary
vendors correctly note that initial acquisition costs are only part
of TCO (understandably, since OSS typically has lower initial
acquisition costs), but often conveniently omit mentioning that
proprietary programs usually impose upgrade costs every few years. 
Also consider possible options if more units are acquired later (if
you later decide to use twice as many OSS installations, vs.
proprietary installations, what is the difference?).  Using OSS,
you can often pay in time instead of money, and the OSS may be a
bargain, but there are still costs.  To decide between different
OSS support options, it&rsquo;s often helpful to treat the options
as if they were different products.
<li>
Both proprietary and OSS COTS normally disclaim warranty and
indemnification; the answer to the question &ldquo;who do you sue
when things go wrong?&rdquo; is &ldquo;nobody&rdquo; in both cases.
Those who think that they can easily succeed in suing a
proprietary vendor for a software bug are in for a rude awakening.
<li>
The trustworthiness of the developers is often unknown, and this is
true for both proprietary and OSS.  Do not believe that proprietary
software is always more trustworthy; a &ldquo;good American
company&rdquo; can easily sell proprietary software littered with
malicious code, whether it was developed in the U.S. or overseas
(indeed, the seller is often <i>not </i>the software developer). 
In all cases, you should do due diligence, and where it is critical
you should determine <i>who</i> the main suppliers of your <i>actual</i>
software are, as well as examining their development process and
the resulting software itself.  OSS makes some mitigation
techniques easier, e.g., often you can review the OSS source code,
process, and/or determine who the real developers are.
</ul>
<p>There are certainly
differences in COTS OSS, however.  Because COTS OSS is normally
developed with greater process and code openness, there are more and
different sources of information for evaluation (bug databases,
mailing list discussions, and so on).  As noted earlier, OSS
generally involves pay-per-improvement, while proprietary involves
pay-per-use, and in OSS, pay can be time or money.  Support can be
competed and changed.  Since OSS can be modified and redistributed,
there is a new decision: When <i>should</i> those options be
employed?</p>
<p>One option should
normally <i>not</i> be used: Creating a &ldquo;fork&rdquo;.  A
&ldquo;fork&rdquo; is a competing OSS project, based on a copy of
the original project&rsquo;s code, that is established with the
intent to compete with or replace the original project.  Creating a
fork is often an emotional event, because it is similar to a call
for a &ldquo;vote of no confidence&rdquo; in a parliament or a call
for a labor strike in a labor dispute.  Those creating the fork are
essentially stating that they believe the project&rsquo;s current
leadership is ineffective, and are asking developers and users to
vote against the existing project leadership by agreeing to switch
to the fork instead.  If the developers and users switch to the
fork, the <i>fork</i> becomes the host of the trusted repository.</p>
<p>Most attempts to
create forks fail, for there must be a very strong reason for
developers and users to switch to a competing project.  Serious
attempts to create a fork take a great deal of campaign effort (to
convince people to switch), and can create ill will in developers
whose support will be needed later (because their valuable time can
be consumed in discussing governance issues instead of improving the
product).  In nearly all cases either the original project or the
fork collapses, because neither developers nor users want the
confusion and division of effort that stem from having competing
repositories.</p>
<p><a href="https://dwheeler.com/essays/gpl-compatible.html#xfree86">A
rare successful fork
happened to the XFree86 project</a>. The XFree86 project leader decided
to change the project&rsquo;s license in 2004 to one that would have
made XFree86 illegal to use by many of its users.  The XFree86
leadership ignored many attempts to resolve this issue, so a fork
was established at X.org.  The XFree86 project was then quickly
abandoned by essentially all users and developers.</p>
<p>Forks are rarely
necessary.  The fact that OSS projects <i>can</i> be forked tends to
force OSS project leaders to listen to the needs of their customers,
just as free elections encourage political leaders to listen to
their constituents.  The knowledge that a fork <i>can</i> be created
encourages leaders to be interested in contributions from others.</p>
<h1>Starting an OSS Project</h1>
<p>Starting an OSS
project requires that you check the usual project-start
requirements: Is there a need, is the proposal significantly better
than alternatives, what is the expected TCO, and so on.  In many
ways, the OSS approach is like a government off-the-shelf (GOTS)
solution, in that the government can directly control the result by
investing its own efforts.  Unlike a GOTS effort, there is greater
opportunity for cost-sharing, with the trade that there is greater
openness.</p>
<p>Fundamentally, OSS
development processes are about <i>cost-sharing</i> with other
interested users.  This means that there needs to be at least the
possibility of other users, and that any such project must work hard
to remove barriers to entry.  Such an OSS project should:</p>
<ul>
<li>
Use a common, well-known OSS license (e.g., GPL, LGPL, MIT/X,
BSD-new) &ndash; don&rsquo;t write your own license
<li>
Establish a project website (with mailing list, tracker, source,
etc.)
<li>
Document the scope and major decisions of the project
<li>
Use typical infrastructure/tools (e.g., a common OSS Software
Configuration Management system, widely-supported languages, and so
on)
<li>
Maximize portability and avoid proprietary languages/libraries
<li>
Must run; a small-but-running program is <i>much</i> better than
mounds of code that does not run
<li>
Establish the vetting process(es) that will occur before a version
is used by the government.  E.G., there may be a government-paid
lead, or a testing process.
</ul>
<p>  
These are fundamentally the same issues as for proprietary software.
There are many articles and books on how to run an OSS project;
consult them.</p>
<h1>Security</h1>
<p>Neither OSS nor
proprietary software is <i>always</i> more secure.  Yet OSS does
have a potential advantage: OSS better meets the &ldquo;open design
principle&rdquo;, a fundamental principle in developing secure
software that any &ldquo;protection mechanism must not depend on
attacker ignorance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s critical to
understand that hiding source code, as proprietary software vendors
typically do, does not really impede attacks.  &ldquo;Security by
obscurity&rdquo; approaches rarely work, and to work at all
<i>everything</i> must be kept secret: source code, binaries, and
network traffic in and out of the software must be kept inaccessible
to attackers.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s true that
attackers can modify OSS, but they can also modify proprietary
software &ndash; a hex editor is all you need.  The trick is for an
attacker to get that modified version into the supply chain. For
OSS, this requires subverting, misleading, or becoming the trusted
developers or trusted repository/distribution, <i>and </i>for no one
to notice the attack later.  An attack on the Linux kernel source
code demonstrated that this is not necessarily easy, and that
widely-reviewed OSS projects can resist such attacks
<a href="http://www.newsforge.com/article.pl?sid=03/11/06/1532223">
[Miller2003b]</a>.</p>
<p>For OSS to be secure
from unintentional vulnerabilities, its developers/reviewers must
have security knowledge, there must be people who review the code
(yes, it <i>does</i> happen), and problems must be fixed and
deployed.  When examining an OSS option, examine public information
(such as websites and mailing lists) to see if these conditions are met.
Tools such as static analysis (aka vulnerability scanning) tools and
fuzz testing tools can be very helpful in finding such vulnerabilities;
<a href="http://scan.coverity.com/">
DHS and Coverity run a project that scans the source code of
major OSS projects and sends to the respective project</a>;
<a href="http://opensource.fortifysoftware.com">
Fortify scans many major Java OSS projects and sends them reports</a>.

<h1>Sensible Policies</h1>
<p>A foolish policy would
say &ldquo;no OSS&rdquo; or &ldquo;no GPL&rdquo;.  This would create
a tremendous competitive and strategic disadvantage, and is
essentially the same as the foolish &ldquo;no COTS&rdquo; policies
of some organizations decades ago.  Note that U.S. government policy
specifically forbids a &ldquo;no OSS&rdquo; policy, and
intentionally does not forbid GPL use.</p>
<p>Often foolish policies
focus on forbidding the GPL, an OSS license that in essence forbids
direct linking with proprietary software and requires that someone
given a binary must be able to get the source code.
<a href="https://dwheeler.com/essays/gpl-compatible.html">
The GPL is by
far the most popular OSS license; anywhere from 52%-88% of all
programs use this license (the next most popular are around 10%)</a>.
The MITRE study found that, because of the widespread use of the
GPL, forbidding GPL use was essentially the same as forbidding use
of OSS.  Some proprietary companies advocate &ldquo;no GPL&rdquo; as
a veiled anti-OSS campaign, to inhibit competition.  Certainly there
will be cases where a GPL&rsquo;ed program will be inappropriate,
but those decisions need to be made on a case-by-case basis, not on
emotionalism.</p>
<p>A far more sensible
policy requires that all commercial options be considered, both OSS
and proprietary, including a review of the licensing requirements. 
As clearly required by U.S. policy, acquirers need to ensure that
all licenses (proprietary and OSS) are compatible with their
intended use.  It&rsquo;s fair to note that proprietary end-user
license agreements (EULAs) are often <i>more</i> restrictive than
OSS licenses in areas that matter to actual use, and that the GPL is
often fine for the intended use.</p>
<h1>Conclusions</h1>
<p>There are two kinds of
COTS products: Proprietary and OSS.  Do not make the mistake of
thinking that &ldquo;commercial&rdquo; is the opposite of
OSS&mdash;instead, OSS is a different kind of commercial approach. 
Those who use the term &ldquo;commercial&rdquo; as an antonym for
OSS often find it difficult to understand OSS, since commercial
companies are now investing billions of dollars to develop OSS&mdash;and
you do not want decision-makers or advisors with a poor
understanding of this fundamental shift in commercial IT.</p>
<p>OSS options should
always be considered during acquisitions.  In fact, U.S. government
policies <i>mandate</i> that government acquisitions consider OSS
approaches, through the FAR and OSS policies.  OSS approaches can be
applied by selecting a COTS OSS program, modifying an OSS program,
or even starting a whole new OSS project.  OSS may be components or
even the entire solution.  OSS approaches are not always the best
choice, but it is foolish to ignore them.  After all, OSS is very
flexible, and it often lowers costs (not only directly, but as
competition to other alternatives).</p>
<p>OSS does raise some
strategic questions for governments: How can acquirers be pooled so
they can start OSS projects when appropriate?  How can PMs be
educated about OSS, open architectures, and open standards?  Should
software produced by government research default to OSS, so that all
who pay for research can receive the benefit?  Should software
patents be eliminated (they threaten some OSS projects, have little
evidence of benefit, have great evidence of harm, and most software
developers consider them inappropriate)?</p>
<p>Certainly projects
should change to consider OSS approaches.  This will involve
educating PMs about the differences in OSS and addressing their
fears, emphasizing that OSS options must always be considered (as
already required by U.S. policy).  Classified systems should work to
separate data and program, and layer their programs, to separate
classified from unclassified components.  Open architectures based
on fully open standards should be deployed to enable later change,
including moving to web- browser-neutral systems.  A part of this
will be including requirements that suppliers operationally
demonstrate that they can swap components because they use open
standards.</p>
<p>OSS approaches present
an opportunity, as well as a challenge, for those who can best
determine how to apply them.</p>

 The DoD policy memo "Commercial Acquisitions" (Jan. 5, 2001) explains that the benefits of commercial item acquisition include "increased competition; use of market and catalog prices; and access to leading edge technology and 'non-traditional' business segments".  In other words, DoD policy anticipates that there will be changes in the commercial market - including "non-traditional business segments" - and its policy is to embrace and exploit such changes where appropriate.

AT&L's "Commercial Item Handbook" (November 2001) explains that this broad definition of "commercial item" is intentional, because it "enables the Government to take greater advantage of the commercial marketplace." (See: http://www.acq.osd.mil/dpap/Docs/cihandbook.pdf)
