Microsoft allowed its Internet Explorer browser to languish for
years; after all, once it had most of the market, it had no reason to
improve it.
But in 2004
<a href="http://news.netcraft.com/archives/2004/07/05/browser_wars_to_recommence.html">the browser wars recommenced</a>, due to combination of
serious vulnerabilities, lacking functionality, and - most importantly -
renewed competition (primarily from OSS/FS).
<a href="http://www.internetnews.com/ent-news/article.php/3392061">
Internet News</a> soon reported that
"Faced with a new kind of browser war, Microsoft has kick-started
renewed development around its flagship Internet Explorer (IE),
prompting speculation that IE 7.0 could be coming down the pike."

Interview with Xiph's Monty</a>
"The mp3 patents cover a number of audio coding techniques that were obvious
to me in my first weeks of coding study and effectively hobble any
credible competition from using mp3 to compete with Thomson.
Four years ago I was employed by an internet radio company that was
refused an mp3 patent by Thomson (we asked for the right to use mp3
for one year; they set the price for the patent licenses at $60 million)
because we were competing directly with a company partially owned by Thomson.
Thomson used these patents not for just compensation, but to
eliminate a competitor.
We had to start completely from scratch with Ogg because the mp3 patents
prevented us from standing (and building) on the shoulders of giants.
We had real ideas to offer, but couldn't afford to ante up."
