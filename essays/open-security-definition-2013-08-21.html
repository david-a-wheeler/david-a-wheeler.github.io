“open security,” along with some background, clarifications, and discussion.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Various government projects work to enable “open security” –
but what does that term mean?  This article proposes an answer, along with
background, clarifications, and discussion.</p>

<h1>Proposed Definition</h1>

<p>Open security is the application of open source software
(OSS) approaches to help solve cyber security problems.  OSS approaches collaboratively
develop and maintain intellectual works (including software and documentation) by
enabling users to use them for any purpose, as well as study, create, change, and
redistribute them (in whole or in part).  Cyber security problems are a lack of
security (confidentiality, integrity, and/or availability), or potential lack
of security (a vulnerability), in computer systems and/or the networks they are
a part of.</p>

<p>In short, open security improves <i>security </i>through <i>collaboration.</i></p>

<h1>Background</h1>

<p>Modern society depends on computer systems for a myriad of
functions, yet cyber security weaknesses enable attackers to subvert those
computer systems.  Often attackers have the advantage— attackers can typically
exploit systems by finding one or a few weaknesses, while defenders must
eliminate or remediate a large number of potential vulnerabilities in large,
complex systems.</p>

<p>In recent years OSS approaches have enabled widespread collaboration
and produced high-quality, widely used products.  Widely used OSS programs
include Linux (a key part of Android), the Apache web server, and the Firefox
web browser.  OSS approaches have proven themselves in areas beyond software,
e.g., Wikipedia uses OSS approaches to develop and maintain a remarkable encyclopedia.</p>

<p>Since OSS approaches have proven themselves useful in
solving other problems, it seems reasonable to believe that OSS approaches
could help solve some cyber security problems as well.</p>

<p>Defenders working together to eliminate and remediate vulnerabilities
are likely to be far more effective than if they work in isolation.  For
example, defenders as a group can be more innovative and more thorough, since
with OSS approaches many different ideas can be quickly combined together.  OSS
approaches are not free of cost, but since they often cost nothing to license
and support can be competed, OSS solutions are often inexpensive and thus more
likely to be used.</p>

<p>This is not to say that all solutions must necessarily be
OSS, or that OSS approaches can solve all cyber security problems.  However,
OSS approaches have much to offer in resolving current cyber security problems.</p>

<h1>Clarifications</h1>

<p>Open security is simply the application of OSS approaches to
a particular type of problem, so it builds on existing OSS approaches.  People
must be allowed to legally collaborate, so:</p>

<ul style='margin-top:0in' type=disc>
 <li>When applied to software, this proposed definition
     requires that software be released to users with rights that meet the Open
     Source Definition <a href="http://opensource.org/osd-annotated">[OSI]</a> as maintained by the Open Source Initiative (OSI),
     as well as the Free Software Definition
     <a href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html">[FSF]</a> as maintained by the Free
     Software Foundation (FSF).  Both the OSI and FSF perform legal reviews to
     determine whether licenses meet these definitions; such licenses include
     the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) license, the Apache 2.0
     license, the GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL), and the GNU General
     Public License (GPL).</li>
 <li>When applied to other works (such as documentation), this proposed
     definition requires works to meet the Definition of Free Cultural Works
     <a href="http://freedomdefined.org/Definition">[FreedomDefined]</a>.  This definition is used, for example, by the WikiMedia
     Foundation <a href="http://wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Resolution:Licensing_policy">[WikiMedia]</a>.  Such content is often called “open content” (though
     that term has many meanings).  Works that meet this definition include
     those released under the Creative Commons Attribution (CC-BY) and <span
     class=st>Attribution-ShareAlike (CC-BY-SA) licenses.  Works that do not
     meet this definition include those released under the </span>Creative
     Commons “non-commercial” licenses (which forbid commercial use) and “no-derivative”
     licenses (which forbid further collaboration) <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/">[Creative Commons]</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Intellectual works that have no copyright (e.g., a “work of
the U.S. government” as defined in 17 USC 101) may provide these freedoms.  When
they do, OSS approaches can also be applied to them.</p>

<p>Legally allowing collaboration is only the first step—the
next is to actually collaborate.  There are many different ways to collaborate,
and many tools that support it, but these can be varied depending on the needs
of the collaborators.</p>

<h1>Discussion</h1>

<p>The definition of open security could have been narrowed to apply
only to software, or broadened to include work whose receivers have fewer
rights.  These alternatives were rejected for the following reasons:</p>

<ul style='margin-top:0in' type=disc>
<li>
A software-only definition excludes collaborative development of
other helpful materials, such as documentation to help developers write better
software.  Indeed, typical definitions of “software” include some kinds of
documentation.  There seems to be no strong reason to use a narrower definition,
and many reasons to use an inclusive one.</li>

<li>A definition that eliminates some of these rights would eliminate
the ability, or many of the incentives, to collaborate.</li>
</ul>

<p>The open security definition is derived from the free
software definition, because that definition is much shorter and simpler than
the open source definition (the most likely alternative).  Formal U.S. Government
definitions, such as the definition in the U.S. DoD 2009 policy <a href="http://dodcio.defense.gov/Portals/0/Documents/FOSS/2009OSS.pdf">[DoD2009]</a>, also
use the free software definition as their starting point.</p>

<p>This definition of open security does not exclude “open
hardware” per se, but the definition of the term “open hardware” is still in
flux at the time of this writing.  Additionally, the current focus in the open
security community is more on improving software and related documentation and
less on hardware.  Thus, it seems appropriate to focus the definition and
discussion on the better-understood areas, without excluding hardware in the
future.</p>

<h1>Conclusions</h1>

<p>Simply defining the term “open security” does not solve
cyber security problems.  However, a clear definition of “open security” makes
it easy to determine whether an approach is, or is not, open security.</p>

<p>Since open security approaches have the potential to help
solve serious problems, a clear definition will help people focus on
determining where open security approaches can be best applied.</p>
