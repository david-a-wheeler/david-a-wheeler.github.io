<h1 class="title">Notes on Fedora Linux</h1>
<h2 class="author">David A. Wheeler</h2>
<h2 class="date">2011-07-29</h2>

<p>
I&#8217;m a long-time user of Fedora Linux.
Here are some notes about using Fedora; you may find them useful.

<p>
The <a href="http://www.fedorafaq.org/">Unofficial Fedora FAQ</a> has
lots of useful notes.
See
<a href="./virtualbox-fedora-linux.html">Virtualbox with Fedora</a>
if you&#8217;re using Fedora on Virtualbox.

<p>
Fedora, like all modern Linux distributions, includes a package management
system to automate installing, uninstalling, and updating packages
of software.
If you can, install or uninstall packages using the package manager
to get the software you need.
Try to not work against the package manager; you can install software
directly if you must, but the package manager automates a lot.
Most users will directly use the &#8220;Add/Remove Software&#8221; GUI application
to install and uninstall packages.
Under the hood, that GUI applications uses &#8220;yum&#8221; to figure out
what packages need to acquired and how to get them
(in particular, if package A needs package B, then if you try to install
package A, it will tell you about the other packages it needs to install).
Yum in turn uses the lower-level &#8220;rpm&#8221; program
to actually install and uninstall packages (which are in &#8220;RPM&#8221; format).
If you&#8217;re a developer, you might want to see
see <a href="http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/PackageMaintainers/CreatingPackageHowTo">how to create an RPM package (for Fedora)</a>,
and at the very least, please follow the
<a href="https://dwheeler.com/essays/releasing-floss-software.html">time-tested community standards for &#8220;Releasing Free/Libre/Open Source Software (FLOSS) for Source Installation&#8221;</a> (such as implementing DESTDIR).

<h1>General tricks</h1>
<p>
If you&#8217;ve installed some service but it&#8217;s not working,
make sure the service is actually running, and start it if it isn&#8217;t
(E.G., see &#8220;Administration/Services&#8221; or similar).
Then make sure the Firewall is letting requests in.
<p>
If the desktop display is wonky (e.g., it seems to pop up windows
you weren&#8217;t expecting), you might try logging out, then
logging in as text user (control-alt-F2), and remove the &#8220;.cache&#8221; directory
with &#8220;rm -fr ~/.cache&#8221;.
Log out (with control-D), switch back to to GUI mode (control-alt-F7 or -F1).
<p>
As always, follow the
<a href="http://xkcd.com/627/">Tech Support Cheat Sheet</a>;
in particular, remember that
Google is your friend.
<p>
As with any system,
you should run as a &#8220;normal user&#8221; most of the time.
From the terminal you can run a privileged command using
&#8220;<tt>su&nbsp;-c&nbsp;COMMAND</tt>&#8221;.  You can also use <tt>sudo</tt>
by adding your username to the group &#8220;wheel&#8221;; just execute
&#8220;<tt>su&nbsp;-c&nbsp;'usermod&nbsp;-G&nbsp;wheel&nbsp;YOUR_USER_NAME'</tt>&#8221; and from then on
you can say
<a href="http://xkcd.com/149/">&#8220;<tt>sudo&nbsp;COMMAND</tt>&#8221;</a>.



<h1>Fedora 15</h1>

<p>
Fedora 15 printer configuration approach isn&#8217;t working for me. So instead, install the &#8220;system-config-printer&#8221; (a different printer configuration tool), &#8220;system-config-services&#8221;, and &#8220;cups&#8221; packages. Run system-config-services and start the &#8220;cups&#8221; service. Run &#8220;Firewall&#8221; and enable the Network Printing Client (port 631; you might want to enable the Network Printing Server too). Now run system-config-printer to configure the printer.

<p>
If you need to install the proprietary
<a href="http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Flash">Flash plug-in, see the
Fedora project wiki page on how to do that</a>.
Hopefully HTML5 and unencumbered formats (like
Google's VP8 video format and the Ogg Vorbis audio format)
will make Flash go away in the long term.

<p>
There's no GUI to turn off the sounds on login, which is annoying.
<a href="https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=503360">There is a way to disable gdm sounds</a>, though.

<!--
<p>

<a href="http://linuxandfriends.com/2011/05/28/install-adobe-flash-player-in-fedora-15/">Here's how to install Flash on Fedora 15</a>.
I expect the Fedora Unofficial FAQ will eventually have this info.
I tried these instructions on <a href="http://www.if-not-true-then-false.com/2010/install-adobe-flash-player-10-on-fedora-centos-red-hat-rhel/">how to install Flash on Fedora 15</a>, but they
didn't work for me.

<h1>GNOME 3 Shell on Fedora 15+</h1>
<p>
Fedora 15 comes with the new GNOME 3 shell, which introduces a radically
new user interface.
Change can sometimes be good, so I&#8217;ve tried to give the new GNOME 3 shell
a fair trial.
But after giving it some time, I&#8217;ve decided that
I <i>hate</i> GNOME 3 shell as it&#8217;s currently implemented.
It&#8217;s not just me;
the list of people who have complaints about the GNOME 3 shell include
<a href="https://plus.google.com/106327083461132854143/posts/SbnL3KaVRtM">Linus Torvalds</a>,
<a href="http://linux.derkeiler.com/Mailing-Lists/Fedora/2011-05/msg01227.html">Alan Cox</a> (who says
&#8220;hopefully by FC16 Gnome will actually be usable again&#8221;),
<a href="https://plus.google.com/u/0/117091380454742934025/posts/N5yRWsdXwGw">
Theodore Ts'o and Ingo Molnar</a>,
<a href="http://www.dedoimedo.com/computers/gnome-3.html">Dedoimedo</a>
(see also
<a href="http://www.dedoimedo.com/computers/gnome-3-fallback.html">here</a>),
<a href="http://k3rnel.net/2011/05/01/why-im-sick-and-tired-of-gnome-shell/">
k3rnel.net (Juan &#8220;Nushio&#8221; Rodriguez)</a>,

and
others
(e.g., see the <a href="http://www.linuxinsider.com/rsstory/73026.html">Linux Insider story</a>).
So many people are leaving GNOME 3, often moving to XFCE, that
one person posted
<a href="http://inspirated.com/2011/05/11/gnome-3-unity-and-xfce-the-mass-exodus">&#8220;GNOME 3, Unity, and XFCE: The Mass Exodus&#8221;</a>.

<p>
The GNOME 3 shell <i>is</i> beautiful. No doubt.
But as far as I can tell, the developers
concentrated on making it beautiful, cool and different, 
while specifically working to make it <i>not</i> useful or
efficient for people to use.
<a href="http://www.dedoimedo.com/computers/gnome-3-fallback.html">Dedoimedo
summarizes GNOME 3.0 shell as,
&#8220;While it&#8217;s a very pretty and comely interface,
it struck me as counterproductive, designed with a change
for the sake of change.&#8221;</a>
In different post
<a href="http://www.dedoimedo.com/computers/gnome-3.html">Dedoimedo says,
&#8220;Gnome 3 is a toy. A beautiful, aesthetic toy. But it is not a
productivity item... I am not a child. My computer is not a toy. It&#8217;s a
serious tool... Don&#8217;t mistake conservative for inefficient. I just want
my efficiency.&#8221;.</a>
<p>
Some developers have tried to fix its worst problems with extensions,
and if GNOME developers work at, I think they could change it into something
useful.  But I&#8217;m going to switch to XFCE so I can get work done, and
perhaps try again later.
Thankfully, Fedora 15 makes it easy to switch to another desktop
like XFCE.
<p>
<h2>The problems with GNOME 3</h2>
<p>
GNOME 3&#8217;s shell makes it much harder to do simple, common tasks,
and often hides how to do them.
That&#8217;s not just my opinion, lots of people say this.
<a href="http://k3rnel.net/2011/05/01/why-im-sick-and-tired-of-gnome-shell/">
k3rnel.net says,
&#8220;Gnome&#8217;s &#8216;Simplicity&#8217; is down right insulting to a computer enthusiast. It makes it impossible to do simple tasks that used to flow naturally, and it&#8217;s made dozens of bizarre &#8216;design decisions&#8217;, like hiding Power Off behind the &#8216;Alt&#8217; key.&#8221;</a>
Let me explain what I mean.
<p>
GNOME 3, particularly its default GNOME shell,
creates a lot of extra steps and work to do simple tasks that
used to be simpler.
To run a program whose name you don&#8217;t know, you have go to the far top
left to the hot spot (or press &#8220;LOGO&#8221;),
move your mouse to the hideously hard-to-place
(and not obvious) &#8220;Applications&#8221; word slightly down the right, then mouse
to the far right to choose a category, then mouse back to choose it.
Remarkably, there doesn&#8217;t seem to be a quick way to simply show
the list of (organized) applications you can start; there&#8217;s not even a
keyboard shortcut for &#8220;LOGO Applications&#8221;.
Eek.  This is a basic item; even Windows 95 was easier.
Would it really have killed anyone to make moving to
some other area (say, the bottom left corner) show the applications?
And why are the categories on the far right, where they are least easy to
get to and not where any other system puts them?
(Yes, the favorites area lets you start some programs, but you have to
find it the first time, and some of us use many programs.)
Also, you can&#8217;t quickly alt-tab between arbitrary windows
(Alt-tab only moves between apps, and the undisoverable alt-&#8216; only moves
between windows of the same app).
GNOME shell makes it easy to do IM, but it makes it harder to do everything
else.
Fail.

<p>
Its capabilities are not discoverable, too.
To log off or change system settings you click on your name &mdash;
and that&#8217;s already non-obvious.
But it gets worse.
<a href="http://www.learnbydoingit.org/2011/06/fedora-15-tweaks/">
To power off, you click on your name,
then press the ALT key to display the power off option, then select it</a>.
How the heck would a normal user find out about this?
The only obvious way to power down the system
is to log out, then power off from the front.
If you know an application name, pressing LOGO (aka WINDOWS) and typing
its name is actually a reasonable approach, but that is not discoverable either.
If you want a new process or window
(like a new terminal window or file manager window),
you have to know press control when you select its icon to start a new process
(for Terminal, you can also start it and press shift+control+N, but that
is not true for all programs).
Fail.
<p>
There are some nice things about it.  I like the ability to press LOGO and then
click on a window, and the ability to start typing a program name
(which you can then select) - that <i>is</i> nice.
But even then, this is not discoverable; how would a user new to the
interface know that they should press the LOGO button?
<p>
<a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/433409/">LWN noted the problems of
GNOME 3 shell way back</a>.
<p>
The implementors seem to think that new is automatically better.  Rediculous.
I don&#8217;t use computers to have the newest fad interface.
I don&#8217;t mind changes, but they should be obvious improments.
Every change just for its own sake imposes relearning costs, especially
for people like me who use many different computers and interfaces,
and especially if they make common operations harder
(like &#8220;show me the applications that are available&#8221;).
Non-discoverability is especially nasty; people don&#8217;t want to read
manuals for basic GUI interfaces, they want to get things done.
<p>
It&#8217;s also just not very mature.
For example, as of 2011-07-28,
<a href="http://blog.fpmurphy.com/2011/03/customizing-the-gnome-3-shell.html">GNOME 3 does not support screensavers</a> - it just shows a blank screen
after a timeout.
But the previous GNOME 2 had screensavers.
Heck, Windows 3.0 (of 1993) did better than that.
<p>
I&#8217;ve tried to get used to it, because I wanted to give new ideas a chance.
Different can be better!
But so far, I&#8217;m not impressed.
The code may be cleaner, and it may be pretty, but the user experience
is currently lousy.

<h2>There is hope</h2>
<p>
If you&#8217;re using the GNOME Shell, you basically <i>must</i> read the
<a href="http://live.gnome.org/GnomeShell/CheatSheet">GNOME shell
cheat sheet</a>, because so much of what it does is un-intuitive,
incompatible with everything else, and non-discoverable.
Thankfully, after reading the documentation and
with some configuration work, GNOME Shell can be made somewhat tolerable.
I expect that it wouldn&#8217;t be hard for the developers to make it better;
hopefully the GNOME folks will work to improve it.

<h2>One approach: Switch to another desktop</h2>
<p>
You could choose to switch to another,
<a href="http://www.renewablepcs.com/about-linux/kde-gnome-or-xfce">more productive and mature desktop environment</a>.
Obvious options are XFCE and KDE.
There are also serious
<a href="http://resalxh.wordpress.com/2011/07/06/fedora-15-with-openbox/">
praises for OpenBox</a>, though I haven&#8217;t tried that yet.
<p>
XFCE is a lightweight desktop environment, and is
what I&#8217;ve chosen to use instead of the default GNOME 3 shell.
(I found out later that
<a href="http://mso-chronicles.blogspot.com/2011/02/keeping-up-with-fedora-15-and-xfce.html">other people have switched to XFCE after
trying and hating GNOME 3&#8217;s shell</a>).
<p>
You can quickly install XFCE on the command line by doing this:
<pre>
yum groupinstall XFCE
</pre>
<p>
XFCE doesn&#8217;t look as nice as GNOME 3, indeed, the GNOME 3 shell
is really quite flashy by comparison.
But the GNOME shell makes it hard for me to get anything done,
and that&#8217;s more important.
I expect that many of GNOME 3&#8217;s
problems will be fixed over time, and then I&#8217;ll try it again.
But I&#8217;m in no hurry; XFCE works just fine.
<p>
Here are some tricks for configuring XFCE.
The XFCE terminal doesn&#8217;t blink, and gnome-terminal has problems in XFCE (it resizes inappropriately),
so I decided to use sakura instead XFCE&#8217;s usual terminal.
I set it to use a bold green font (I find that easier to read).
I prefer panels to be at the bottom;
You can move the XFCE panel to the bottom by right-clicking on the panel&#8217;s
right edge, then Panel, Panel Preferences, and turn on &#8220;Lock panel&#8221;.
Drag its left edge to the bottom, then re-lock it.
I also added a screen lock button (to do that, right click on the panel,
choose add new items, hoose action buttons, select action type as Lock);
You can configure the XFCE or Orange clock&#8217;s format (note: their
&#8220;custom format&#8221; string is the same as in &#8220;man date&#8221;, but that is not
documented); I changed the clock options
to &#8220;%F&nbsp;%R&#8221; so I can see the date and time.
I used Nautilus as the file manager for a while
(I&#8217;m more familiar with it than with XFCE&#8217;s
native &#8220;Thunar&#8221; file manager), but it occasionally crashes.
So I&#8217;ve switched to XFCE-native Thunar as the file manager;
it generally works fine, but an annoying
<a href="https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=712469">bug in
Thunar 1.2.2 means that you can't see SMB (Samba) shares from Thunar</a>.
A work-around is to run Nautilus from the command line when you want to
use SMB shares; upstream thinks it has found the cause and hopefully it will
be fixed soon.
Be sure to set Preferences &gt; Preferred Applications (e.g., for Terminal
and manager).
If you set a custom theme there can be oddnesses;
<a href="http://www.kirsle.net/blog/kirsle/gnome-s-impact-on-everything">
XFCE uses GTK+ 2, while GNOME uses GTK+ 3</a>,
but if you don&#8217;t set a custom theme that won&#8217;t matter.
I installed the screensaver &#8220;rss-glx-xscreensaver&#8221;
(GNOME 3 doesn&#8217;t even have screensavers!); they&#8217;re nifty.
<p>
The built-in XFCE window manager has some nice capabilities, but
some of its nice visual improvements require you to first
go to Preferences/Windows Manager Tweaks/Compositor to
&#8220;Enable display compositing&#8221;; this enables partial transparency and such
(I particularly like turning on transparency when moving or resizing windows).
<a href="https://bugzilla.xfce.org/show_bug.cgi?id=7862">I&#8217;ve already asked the XFCE developers to make this more obvious.</a>
It's not fancy overall, though, and in a few cases that's mildly annoying;
e.g., there's no visual indication when you launch a program that it is
on its way
(see <a href="https://bugzilla.xfce.org/show_bug.cgi?id=7869">XFCE bug 7869 - When a launcher is pressed, make it clear it's launching something (animate the launcher button</a>).
The standard XFCE window manager is reliable, but a little boring.
<p>
More recently I am using
<a href="http://fedora.rasmil.dk/blog/?p=268">Compiz with XFCE</a>.
Compiz is much flashier than the XFCE built-in window manager, and those
flashy effects are not only fun, but they can help make clearer what's
going on.
Compiz requires more graphics chip power;
XFCE's window manager was designed for low-power systems, but my
machine can handle the load that Compiz demands.
To do this,
<a href="http://fedora.rasmil.dk/blog/?p=268">Install Compiz with XFCE</a>
(this just adds "compiz-manager" to the programs run on
session startup in Preferences/Session and Startup/Application Autostart).
Then go to Preferences, CompizConfig Settings Manager,
and change what you want.
I suggest turning on the Desktop Cube, Rotate Cube, Animations,
Wobbly Windows, and Resize info; on "move window" I changed opacity down
to 85%.
It doesn't have an easy way to make resizing windows transparent, sadly,
but you can make resizing shade and that's nice
(you can probably make them transparent, but I haven't delved into that).
Now the bad news:
<a href="https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=730377">Compiz
doesn't work well with Xscreensaver (Fedora bug 730377)</a>.
For now, you can work around this by installing my
<a href="../misc/fixscreensaver">fixscreensaver</a> script in your
home directory, and then go to
Preferences/Session and Startup/Application Autostart
to make that script automatically start.

<!--

Compiz and xscreensaver seem to be incompatible; here's a nasty hack:
  http://jsilva.komodoopenlab.com/blog/archives/187

Another way to get Compiz up:
  http://www.fedoraforum.org/forum/showthread.php?t=264540
-->
<p>
The &#8220;cairo-dock&#8221; launcher is graphically slick;
you can position it where you want by holding down ALT while dragging it.
I&#8217;m sure some people will love it, but after playing around with it,
I decided to move on.
<p>
GNOME 3 shell <i>does</i> have a cool idea: you can press the LOGO (WINDOWS)
button, start typing an application name, and it will show you the list
of applications.
But you can get the same basic effect in XFCE; it&#8217;s not as
pretty, but just as functional.
Simply select Preferences/ Keyboard/
Application Shortcuts, and then press the +Add button.
Give it &#8220;xfce4-appfinder&#8221; as the command name, press OK, and then
press and release LOGO-Right-LOGO.
Now you have it - you can press LOGO-Right-LOGO and type in any part of the
application name; one ENTER brings you to the matching list, and the next
ENTER runs the selected applications.
If you use &#8220;xfce4-popup-applicationsmenu&#8221; instead of &#8220;xfce4-appfinder&#8221;,
you&#8217;ll get a more traditional popup of the applications menu.

<!--
If I enable gnome-session from within XFCE, I get a bogus extra
file manager window, which is annoying.
This may be related to this:
http://linux.derkeiler.com/Mailing-Lists/Fedora/2011-05/msg01199.html
For now, I just don't enable gnome-session.
-->


<h2>Another approach: GNOME 3 Fallback mode</h2>
<p>
One approach, as discussed by
<a href="http://www.dedoimedo.com/computers/gnome-3-fallback.html">Dedoimedo</a>,
is to force fallback mode.
This turns on a more tradtional interface.
<p>
Unfortunately,
there were odd problems with this in Fedora, e.g., I can minimize but
I didn&#8217;t have a panel bar where they went to.
(A traditional interface is supposed to be at the bottom, but I
don&#8217;t see any)
I think this is not well-tested, which is too bad, it has promise.
<a href="http://dasublogbyprashanth.blogspot.com/2011/04/review-gnome-3.html">
Several</a>
<a href="http://www.rootninja.com/gnome-3-fallback-desktop-better-than-gnome-3-itself/">people</a> have declared that GNOME 3 fallback is better than
GNOME shell itself.
<p>
I gave up on this, but
if you want to try it,
go to the user name (top right), click on it, select
System Settings &gt; System Info &gt; Graphics, 
and turn on &#8220;Forced Fallback Mode&#8221;.

<p>
If you don&#8217;t like that, you can try to tweak the GNOME 3 interface;
below is info on how to do that.
I tried this for a while.


<h2>Adding minimize/maximize buttons</h2>

<p>
Install the gnome-tweak-tool (e.g., &#8220;yum install gnome-tweak-tool&#8221;). Run it, e.g., by pressing LOGO-button, typing &#8220;tweak&#8221;, and pressing Enter. Select the &#8220;shell&#8221; tab, and then set &#8220;Arrangement of buttons on the titlebar&#8221; to &#8220;all&#8221;. (The <a href="https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=649520">formatting of the shell tab is getting fixed</a>). You can use gnome-tweak-tool to tweak the user interface in other ways, e.g.., to display date as well as time. Log out and back in to see it!
</p>

<p>
<a href="http://www.khattam.info/howto-add-minimize-maximizerestore-buttons-in-gnome-3-2011-05-26.html">;
You can also add minimize/maximize buttons</a> by installing and running &#8220;gconf-editor&#8221;. Move to Desktop&gt;gnome&gt;shell&gt;windows,
find button_layout and enter the following to add Minimize and Maximize buttons: <tt>:minimize,maximize,close</tt>
</p>

<h2>Other fixes</h2>
<p>
The gnome-tweak-tool has other capabilities.
For example, you can
<a href="http://linuxishbell.wordpress.com/2011/06/15/bring-back-missing-functionality-in-gnome-3-0/">bring the desktop back (some think this
is the most useful change)</a>; after running it, select
the File Manager left-tab, then turn on &#8220;Have file manager handle desktop&#8221;.
<p>
<a href="http://ranjith.zfs.in/gnome-shell-extensions-for-fedora-15-open-suse-11-4-arch-linux/">Installing various gnome-shell-extension-* packages</a>
can help too.
<p>
Some useful extensions to install:
<ul>
<li>gnome-shell-extensions-alternative-status-menu - Makes Alt-tab switch between windows, not applications.  (<a href="http://live.gnome.org/GnomeShell/CheatSheet">You can sort of do this with ALT-&#8216;, but many people like me already know and use ALT-tab; why screw up the meaning of a widely-used and long-running multi-operating-system key binding?)</a>
<li>gnome-shell-extensions-alternative-status-menu - Now you can see &#8220;Power off&#8221; as an option
<li>gnome-shell-extensions-drive-menu - easy show removable drives
<li>gnome-shell-extensions-dock - add a dock.  I tried this, but ended up un-installing it.  It isn&#8217;t as good as a traditional panel on the bottom; it&#8217;s on the right-hand side of screen 1, which interferes with fullscreen use, it yet can&#8217;t be moved or hidden.  Most operating system interfaces do this better.
</ul>

<p>
<a href="http://intgat.tigress.co.uk/rmy/extensions/index.html">GNOME shell frippery (by Ron Yorston)</a>
can help.
As of 2011-07-28, they aren&#8217;t in the Fedora yum repository, though there is
an RPM package.
What&#8217;s concerning is that he says
&#8220;it&#8217;s almost inevitable that future changes to the shell
will break them (though I&#8217;ll make every effort to unbreak them)...
There will be conflicts between extensions [also]&#8221;.
It&#8217;s absurd that a user interface infrastructure can&#8217;t handle
normal cases, but there it is.

<h2>Enabling the external SATA connector</h2>
<p>
In some cases, you may need to change a BIOS setting to enable an external interface. Unfortunately, on the Dell Optiplex 760, the external SATA connection is disabled when you have &#8220;ATA&#8221; as the disk interface setting (the default), so you must switch the BIOS to &#8220;AHCI&#8221; instead. If you can, switch to AHCI and then install Linux. If you&#8217;ve already installed Linux, before switching to ACHI, per http://www.ultimatebootcd.com/forums/viewtopic.php?p=6694 you should edit /etc/modprobe.conf and add a line like this:

<pre>
  alias scsi_hostadapter2 ahci
</pre>

Then run this command so that the ahci driver will become available at boot time:
<pre>
mkinitrd -f /boot/initrd-$(uname -r).img $(uname -r)
</pre>

<h2>pci=nomsi</h2>
<p>
<a href="http://www.mail-archive.com/fedora-kernel-list@redhat.com/msg00075.html">
Some computers (such as the Dell Optiplex 760) do not have a working &#8220;MSI&#8221; system, and this interferes with external SATA connections</a>. To fix this, edit /boot/grub/grub.conf so that the &#8220;kernel&#8221; line includes &#8220;pci=nomsi&#8221; at the end, like this:
<pre>
 kernel /vmlinuz-2.6.18-194.3.1.el5 ro root=/dev/RaidSys/Root vga=791 pci=nomsi
</pre>


<h2>ide=nodma</h2>
<p>
Some older computers (particularly Dell) do not have a working &#8220;DMA&#8221; system. The primary symptom is that if you try to test CD-ROMs or DVDs, they will fail, suggesting that they have the wrong data. To fix this, at boot time type this (for the kernel command line):
<pre>
  ide=nodma
</pre>
