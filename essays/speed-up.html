In this commercial parody for Speed Listening, a spokesperson (Denny Dillon) says she is a busy woman who makes time for relaxing activities, such as reading and listening to classical music, by doubling their speeds. [Season 6, 1980]

Train Your Brain to Listen Faster With This Speed-Listening App
Rightspeed allows users to play audiobooks and podcasts at up to ten times the normal playback speed. 
    Ethan Jacobs May 4, 2016
Well, app developer Max Deutsch has created your new favorite app: a speed-listening program called Rightspeed that helps you train your brain to listen to podcasts and audio books at up to ten times the playback speed.

I find that if I listen at normal speed it can sometimes allow my brain to wander between sentences or pauses and I miss things. At 1.3 speed I don't have time to wander and you actually get used to the speed really really quickly. Start at 1.1 then after an hour or so bump it up until you are comfortable and not getting left behind. Also some narrators require faster speeds and other require slower speeds.

give it a try for yourself. it depends on what you're doing, how much attention you give the book, and what the material is.
if i'm doing something that doesn't require thinking (eg: in the car or walking outside), i can listen to 2.5x to 3x just fine depending on the narrator. i usually only do this for narrators i dont like to hurry up with the story. if i enjoy the narrator, i rarely go above 1.5x.
but if i'm working at my job, i have to think about what i'm doing so i only do around 1.5x. similarly, when i'm trying to sleep, i need it slow enough my mind can follow it, so it's around 1.5x
i primarily listen to fiction. if you're trying to follow a physics podcast where they solve math problems, you might not want to speed it up. or if you're listening to something philosophical/religious where you have to think about it, you might want to pause it.
i watch a lot of chess videos; in the slower 15 minute games i can speed up the youtube video to 1.5x. if i'm watching a 30 second game, i don't dare speed it up.

Yes, for nonfiction I can go 1.25x-1.5x. Fiction, I'm mainly in it for the voice acting, so no point there - if it's too slow at 1x, I stop listening.

More and more audio enthusiasts hitting fast forward
Beth Teitell, Globe Staff  November 06, 2015

When Andre Dubus III and his wife narrated the audio book of “House of Sand and Fog,” they created a work of tragedy and suspense that runs for nearly 14 hours.

But Babu Krishnamurthy, a doctor in Boston and the mother of three, hit fast forward and listened to the entire novel in less than half the time.

“I didn’t want to go any faster than that because it’s so beautifully written,” she said.

For better or worse, our society’s need for instant gratification is now changing the way we consume media. People are speeding up podcasts and audio books to “Alvin and the Chipmunks” velocity, and using apps that compress the silences. They are watching TV shows and YouTube clips at accelerated speeds, too.
Get The Weekender in your inbox:
The Globe's top picks for what to see and do each weekend, in Boston and beyond.

They are the busy, the impatient, voracious watchers and listeners who want to feast on the world’s growing library of content, and they don’t mind if the delivery is rushed.

CallmeIshmael.

No one has yet broken the four-minute “TED Radio Hour,” but in Cambridge, Chris Kalafarski, a senior developer at the online platform PRX, the Public Radio Exchange, has trained himself to listen to podcasts at twice the speed of Ira Glass.

“My brain has adjusted to it,” he said.

His brother’s brain, he noted, has not, so even though Kalafarski uses an app that eliminates the high-pitched chipmunk problem that comes with a faster speed, his sibling hates being in the car when Kalafarski turbo-charges podcasts to twice the speed — or 2x, as the speed-listening crowd puts it.

“He refuses to listen — even at just 1.25. Anything faster than normal, he’ll complain because it’s so noticeable to him,” Kalafarski said.

TV viewers have been fast forwarding through or skipping commercials for years, using on-demand services if they allow it, but now they are speeding up the content itself — no special technology needed. On YouTube, you can watch Jimmy Fallon and Kate Upton banter at turbo speed simply by going to the “settings” button on the bottom right and selecting “2x.”

Viewers’ note: If you inadvertently set the speed for 1.25 x, other than thinking that Upton flips her blonde hair kind of quickly, you might not notice the difference. Crank it up to the next setting—1.5 x—and things get hectic. At 2.0, their flirting sounds like the disclaimer portion of a pharmaceutical ad.

TiVo subscribers can pick up the tempo, too. Eager to capitalize on the country’s apparent need to cram awards shows and golf tournaments and other patience-testers, last month the company released a “QuickMode” feature that lets users with the new “BOLT” device watch recorded shows 30 percent faster.

TiVo chose that speed after research found that speeding up any less didn’t save subscribers enough time (every minute counts when you’re trying to complete an entire season of “The Walking Dead”), and that anything faster - even with TiVo’s pitch-corrected audio technology - sounds distorted.

TiVo has not yet compiled user statistics, but one thing is clear: For some, speed viewing and listening is a source of pride.

    ‘Otherwise it can be tedious. It’s still fully comprehensible.’

On TiVo’s message boards, a user named “mattack” boasted about watching shows at 2.5x or faster on the iPad, and added that when he wants to “slow down,” he watches at 1.7x.

And when the popular Pocket Cast podcast app asked users to tweet how much time they’d saved, the company was able to see that some people edited their results to make themselves look even faster.

“Our users are competitive about everything,” said Russell Ivanovic, a co-founder of Shifty Jelly, the Australia-based developer of the $3.99 app, which has been downloded more than 500,000 times.

Some supersonic listeners say that even if they miss a word — or 10 — the caffeinated pace feels right.

John Lagomarsino , the author of a Verge story earlier this year headlined “Stop listening to podcasts sped up to 1.5x,” says some speed-listening friends have started to find the actual pace of human speech distorted.

“They say it sounds like the [radio] hosts are drunk and talking through molasses,” he said.

In Brookline, Carol Rosenstock, a research administrator manager at Boston Children’s Hospital, began listening to Anne Tyler’s novel “The Beginner’s Goodbye” at 1.5x, and after acclimating, sped up 1.75x.

“Otherwise it can be tedious,” she said. “It’s still fully comprehensible.”

Audible, the audio book site owned by Amazon, says it’s seeing a “growing cohort” of speed listeners — some of whom go as fast as 3x.

A company spokesman declined to comment on whether it tracks the trend, but it does know that speed listeners buy and listen to one book more per month than the average Audible customer.

It’s hard to argue against more literature — or is it?

And yet, one person’s time savings is another’s crime against art.

As Nate DiMeo, the host and creator of “The Memory Palace” podcast, put it: “You can listen to Abbey Road on 45, but I’m sure George Martin and the Beatles would not appreciate it.”

Does speed-listening work? We put it to the test

Speed-listening is tempting for on-the-go readers, but before long the talking stops making sense.
By Nick PatchEntertainment Reporter
Sat., Nov. 21, 2015

(Me: Tries it out, but absurdly briefly - you have to BUILD UP to it!!)


I’ve long been told I speak incomprehensibly fast, my words tumbling forth as if emerging from a dangerously overburdened waterslide, so I naturally assumed I’d be an ideal candidate for speed-listening.

The practice of listening to books on tape at double-speed was declared a trend by the Atlantic in June, the latest step in our collective quest to stretch our capacity for information to unforgiving ends. Various tech blogs have recommended powering through podcasts at double speed, while apps such as Overcast and FasterAudio promise expedited playback for full-throttle listeners.

“I’ve heard it’s quite doable,” said Steve Harris, owner of the Harris Institute of Speedreading, noting that his daughter speed-listens to her university lectures. “If the professor’s droning away, slowly and boringly, she just figures: ‘Let’s speed it up.’”

But exactly how does acceleration affect comprehension? And while the tool might be useful for podcast fast-tracking, can it be applied to more demanding literature?

To put the trend to the test, I listened to Andy Weir’s bestseller The Martian at double-speed, while my colleague Ryan Porter absorbed the mission at regular velocity.

He found that the sci-fi genre generally didn’t lend itself to the audiotape experience, with the tale’s jargon jogging by at jarring speed. Listening as he walked around the city, he missed crucial plot points, stayed on elevators too long, and observed TTC riders reading the physical version with jealousy, longing for the Taylor Swift lurking elsewhere on his phone.

Of course, I found the effect even more disorienting. Unless I summoned an uncharacteristic level of focus, I retained little of what was filtering through my earbuds. Only proper nouns, swear words or shouted dialogue reliably refocused my attention. During the particularly science-heavy bits, it felt like someone was rapping the Periodic Table of Elements in my ear.

I reassured myself that I was absorbing untold details subliminally — until I consulted an expert.

“It certainly is possible to absorb information unknowingly,” said J. Bruce Morton, associate professor in the University of Western Ontario’s department of psychology. “But novelists don’t write subliminal novels. If someone has crafted a novel expecting that an audience is going to read it and be consciously aware of the content, I don’t think it makes a lot of sense to talk about the audience’s subliminal impression.”

The benefits of speed-listening, then, may not extend to literature.

But given Ryan’s experience, it seems even regular-speed listening limits comprehension, or at least demands dedicated attention.

“Speaking and therefore listening is almost the least effective way to convey an idea,” Harris said. “The speed of talking is usually around 150 words per minute, and the average literate person reads about 250 words per minute.

“So,” he added, “usually the printed word is a better way to take in information.”

Canadian humorist Terry Fallis has issued all five of his novels as podcasts prior to their physical release, including his recent Poles Apart.

Yet the two-time Stephen Leacock Medal winner doesn’t actually listen to many audiobooks. Podcasts are his distraction of choice, whether in the car, mowing the lawn or washing dishes. His attention does sometimes wander, and he concedes that the same thing probably happens with his listeners.

“There are more distractions because your hands are free,” he said. “But it doesn’t really bother me.”

Fallis says his twin brother Tim, by the way, is a committed speed-listener who feels he loses nothing in hurried translation.

So if any listener wants to floor the pedal during Poles Apart, you’ll hear no complaints from Fallis.

“More power to them if they can do it — it might mean they can listen to more of my audio podcasts,” he laughed.

“But I don’t want to listen to someone speaking that quickly. It stresses me out.”

The Rise of ‘Speed-Listening’
    Megan Garber Jun 24, 2015 Technology 
Books can be places for intellectual wandering. They can also be mined of precious information with ruthless efficiency.

Speed reading, the visual version of Vance's lament, has long been used in the ongoing quest for the efficient absorption of information. And personalized, sped-up audio playback, for its part, has been around since 2004, Brian Feldman notes, when Apple introduced variable playback speeds into its iPod software. In 2007, the “Getting Things Done” blog recommended “adjusting the playback speed of your audiobook or video to a maximum of 150 percent” to complete the book more quickly. In 2010, the tech blog GigaOm suggested “speed-listening to podcasts” as an overall time-saving technique. Software titled, straightforwardly, FasterAudio promises to “cut your audio learning time in half.”

"I use a robotic-sounding voice which speaks at around 450 words per minute. For comparison, English is commonly spoken at around 120-150 words per minute."
