<h1 class="title">Politician's syllogism</h1>

<p>
The
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politician's_syllogism">politician's
syllogism</a> goes like this:

<ul>
<li>We must do something
<li>This is something
<li>Therefore, we must do this.
</ul>

<p>
I strongly reject this logical fallacy in all its forms, from
both the left and from the right.
I understand the desire to quickly "do something" - but often
these knee-jerk decisions make things worse.
There's some ancient wisdom for leaders
that still needs repeating today:

<ul>
<li>"Without counsel plans fail, but with many advisers they succeed."
(Proverbs 15:22 ESV)
<li>"Plans are established by counsel; by wise guidance wage war."
(Proverbs 20:17 ESV)
<li>"For which of you, desiring to build a tower, does not first sit down
and count the cost, whether he has enough to complete it?...
Or what king, going out to encounter another king
in war, will not sit down first and deliberate whether he is able with
ten thousand to meet him who comes against him with twenty thousand?"
(Luke 14:28-31 ESV).
</ul>

<p>
Now it's true that over-analyzing can itself be a problem.
This even has a name: "analysis paralysis".
As General George S. Patton put it,
"A good plan violently executed now is better than a perfect plan executed
next week."
But notice it has to be a <i>good</i> plan -
a bad plan should not be executed at all.

<p>
It's also true that people can disagree on whether or not a benefit
is worth the cost.
But that's a much better kind of debate, because that helps people
enunciate their values.
It's certainly better than being surprised by the unintended consequences
of a bad idea.

<p>
I beg leaders of all kinds:
before doing something, <i>think ahead</i> to estimate
the costs and likely results, and make sure that the costs are likely to
be worth the benefits.
This estimation is hard, so get wise guidance from multiple counselors
to help you think ahead - no one person can think of everything.
Of course, you need to actually <i>execute</i> a plan
to get anything done.
But please, check first that the action will be worth the cost.
