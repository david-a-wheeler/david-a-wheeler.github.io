You asked me about the connection between OSS & green.  Here are some
thoughts:
* Lower power consumption.  OSS can be modified/reconfigured to remove
unneeded functionality and use less power.  Extreme example: OLPC, where
they recoded all sorts of things (often to remove unneeded wakeups),
producing massively lower power use.

* Longer life for computer hardware, so less environmentally-damaging
waste.  Computer hardware is terrible to the environment when thrown
away: toxic metals (mercury, lead, etc.), non-degradable plastics, etc.
 It's also a waste of gold, etc.  Refresh rates for hardware are often
unrelated to user need, but instead driven by software makers' need to
increase functionality so you'll re-buy the product.  (Key example:
Vista.  Did anyone REALLY need Aero?  But they had to buy new
hardware!).  So instead, keep longer, or repurpose existing hardware.
* Less need for hardware, due to hardware consolidation & need for fewer
resources.  Result: less consumption of environmental resources in the
first place.  OSS tends to be much more efficient at using hardware,
because anyone can fix a performance problem.  Also, licensing rules
don't limit virtualization or other sharing, so you can easily share.
Thin clients/web clients are easily implemented with OSS.  (See
http://k12ltsp.org).

The Green Penguin – Where Does Your E-Waste Go?

Linux Journal even has a "green" category:

Here's an oddball example of how open source software can help with
being "green":

They took an open source font, and added "holes" everywhere.  Result:
20% less ink used for printing.


Less memory/disk needs.

an extremely faster, performing and energy saving desktop environment.

Telecommuting: X windows.

Energy Star or black hole?
January 18th, 2009 
Software can often make useless the energy conservation features of
hardware. ("Energy Star" systems end up not meeting "Energy Star" requirements)
Sony: TV guide
"my iMac was not going to sleep even though the screen was blank and
the LED was on... It took some more detective work to figure out that
my mail program, Eudora, was the problem. Qualcomm had stopped supporting it,
so it hadn’t been updated to work with the new Mac OS (10.3?)
and prevented the Mac from sleeping."

Power use - REAL power use may be greatly larger than claimed,
because of other features.  Here's an example, where it didn't
meet its rating by default, and there wasn't even documentation on how
to change thigs so it COULD meet its energy rating:
