<h1 class="title">Say Good Morning if it is Morning Where You Are</h1>

<p>
Many people around the world have learned to use
video chat systems to meet with others, in part due to COVID-19.
However, there's a weird social problem in English: how do you greet people
when people may be in different timezones?

<p>
Some people try to greet others
with "Good morning, good afternoon, good evening, good night."
That seems like the right answer because you're thinking of others.
But that's a rediculously long greeting, and you don't know if those
are the right timezones anyway.
What's worse, it doesn't provide any information to others beyond
"Greetings."

<p>
I urge people to <b>greet from your timezone</b>.
That is, <b>say good morning if it's morning where you are</b>,
and so on.
You might add "from" and your location, e.g.,
"Good morning from Northern Virginia".
Such a greeting is short and tells others a little bit about you.
