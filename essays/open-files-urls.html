<h1 class="title">How to easily open files and URLs from the command line</h1>
<h2 class="author">David A. Wheeler</h2>

<p>
Nearly all operating systems have a simple
command to open up a file, directory, or URL from the command line.
This is really handy when you&#8217;re writing a program, because these are
easy to invoke from almost any language.
You can then pass it a filename (to open that file using the
default application for that file type), a directory name to start
navigating in that directory (use &#8220;.&#8221; for the current directory),
or a URL like
&#8220;<a href="https://dwheeler.com">https://dwheeler.com</a>&#8221;
to open a browser at that URL.
<p>
Here&#8217;s how to open files or URLs from the command line, on lots
of different platforms (Windows, MacOS, Linux/Unix, and Cygwin).
<p>
<h1>Windows</h1>
<p>
You want the <tt>start</tt> command; when running a command line (cmd.exe)
or a batch file, use:
<pre>
  start <i>filename_or_URL</i>
</pre>
<p>
This is a built-in of cmd, so other programs can&#8217;t invoke it as &#8220;start&#8221;,
but other programs <i>can</i> invoke it this way:
<pre>
  cmd /c start <i>filename_or_URL</i>
</pre>
<p>
Note that if it&#8217;s a local filename, and it&#8217;s executable,
<tt>start</tt> will <i>execute</i> that program, not open a viewer of it.
I haven&#8217;t found a Windows command that will easily open files
but never execute them, unfortunately.
This makes <tt>start</tt> (and <tt>explorer</tt>) a potential security
problem, depending on how it's used, but I haven't found a secure built-in
(other than implementing the command yourself).
<p>
Many Internet sources recommend using <tt>explorer</tt> instead,
but there are good reasons to not do that.
If you invoke <tt>explorer</tt> directly, it will <b>ignore</b> the user&#8217;s
selected Internet browser, and will always use Internet Explorer instead.
Users presumably made their choice for a reason, so you should respect it.
(Indeed, Internet Explorer has a terrible history of vulnerabilities,
so <i>forcing</i> its use seems like an bad idea.)
One minor positive when using <tt>explorer</tt>
is that if the executable came from the Internet,
then you&#8217;ll be given a dialogue on whether or not to execute the file.
But this isn't very helpful in real life, because
users typically ignore these dialogues.
Users typically neither understand nor care what these dialogues say, and
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxOIebkmrqs">
they see so many such dialogues that they've been
trained to answer &#8220;okay&#8221; to them</a>.
Thus,
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dancing_pigs">these security dialogues
are basically pointless</a>.
<p>
Strictly speaking, redirection to other file-opening programs
only works from cmd when
&#8220;command extensions&#8221; are enabled, but as of Windows XP
these are enabled by default.
As usual, run &#8220;help start&#8221; to learn more about its options.
The related Windows commands <tt>assoc</tt> and <tt>ftype</tt> are useful
for setting the file type (for a given file extension) and the open command
(for a given file type).

<p>
<h1>MacOS X</h1>
<p>
You want the <tt>open</tt> command, i.e.:
<pre>
  open <i>filename_or_URL</i>
</pre>
<p>
(You can use &#8220;-a&#8221; to force a different application to run.)

<p>
<h1>Linux/Unix</h1>
<p>
You want the <a href="http://portland.freedesktop.org/xdg-utils-1.0/xdg-open.html"><tt>xdg-open</tt></a> command, i.e.:
<pre>
  xdg-open <i>filename_or_URL</i>
</pre>
<p>
This isn&#8217;t always installed, so make sure the
<a href="http://portland.freedesktop.org/xdg-utils-1.0/">xdg-utils</a>
package is installed
(the name of the package is xdg-utils on at least
Fedora, Debian, and Ubuntu; it may have a different name on some other
distributions).
<p>
The xdg-open program is just a wrapper that invokes the &#8220;real&#8221;
opening program(s), but you should use xdg-open instead because
the &#8220;real&#8221; program to do this
varies widely depending on user preference.
This (and similar wrappers) were developed by the
<a href="http://portland.freedesktop.org/wiki/">Portland project at
Freedesktop.org</a>
(<a href="http://lxer.com/module/newswire/view/71524/index.html">
here&#8217;s a news clip about Portland</a>).
The &#8220;real&#8221; program for GNOME is gnome-open
(which may in turn invoke nautilus),
for KDE it&#8217;s kde-open or kfmclient
(which on KDE 4 may in turn invoke dolphin),
for XFCE it&#8217;s really exo-open, and
there are some other programs like mimeopen.
(These, in turn, find the right program to use and invoke it).
Where appropriate, xdg-open follows the BROWSER convention.
<p>
Unfortunately, xdg-open isn't included with stock Solaris.
In many cases, the better solution is to download and install xdg-utils,
which is reported to work fine on Solaris.
But if you must, an alternative is to directly invoke
<a href="http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/ticket/4979">
/usr/dt/bin/sdtwebclient on Solaris</a>.
<p>
If you know for <i>certain</i> that a user is using a particular
user interface, you <i>could</i> call that program (e.g., gnome-open) directly.
But that kind of certainty is rare.
For example, you may have written a GNOME program, but the user
may be using KDE to invoke it; in that case
gnome-open is not the right program to use.
After all, if the user is using KDE, then it&#8217;s the KDE settings
that should be used.
In general, use xdg-open; you&#8217;ll save your sanity and
respect your user&#8217;s preferences.

<h1>Cygwin</h1>
<p>
A simple approach is the <tt>cygstart</tt> command, i.e.:
<pre>
  cygstart <i>filename_or_URL</i>
</pre>
<p>
Note that if it&#8217;s a local filename, and it&#8217;s executable,
opening the file will execute that program.
This is the same problem that Windows has, for the same reasons
(Cygwin runs on top of Windows, and thus inherits many Windows defects
including this one).
<p>
Do <i>not</i> use
<a href="http://www.commandlinefu.com/commands/view/2729/open-windows-executable-file-or-folder-from-cygwin-terminal">
<tt>explorer $(cygpath "path" -w)</tt>
</a>
because although that may be faster, it will often choose the wrong
application (in particular, it will fail to use the user&#8217;s preferred browser).
<p>
Note that <tt>start</tt> does not directly work on
the Cygwin mintty command line, but <tt>explorer</tt> does.
(If you use Cygwin, install mintty immediately; it&#8217;s wonderful.)
You could use <tt>cmd /c start...</tt> instead, but don&#8217;t;
on Cygwin you want to use <tt>cygstart</tt> instead.
When you are <i>running</i> mintty, you can press control-left-button,
or press right-button and select "open".

<p>
I hope that someday the distributed version of
Cygwin will support <tt>xdg-open</tt>,
but as of 2010-07-01 it does not.
I do know that there is
<a href="http://cygwin-ports.git.sourceforge.net/git/gitweb.cgi?p=cygwin-ports/ports;a=commit;h=b4e1bb7">a patch to xdg-open so that it will invoke
cygstart if all else fails</a>.
Cygwin does include a slightly related package with the name
python-xdg, but as of 2012-03-18 the python-xdg
package does not include xdg-open, so that does not help.

<p>
<h1>Making sure it does the right thing (and security issues)</h1>
<p>
Beware of common gotchas.
<p>
First, there is a basic security problem with the easy-to-use
tools in Windows.
Note that some of the Windows-based commands listed above
will <i>execute</i> that file, instead of running a trusted viewer
of the file, if it is a local executable file.
This is true for Windows&#8217; <tt>start</tt> and
Cygwin&#8217;s <tt>cygstart</tt> in particular.
(It may also true of an xdg-open on Cygwin, if any, since it will have to
depend on <tt>cygstart</tt>).
I have not, as yet, found any easy way around this on Windows
(including Cygwin, which since it runs on Windows inherits the flaws
of Windows).
This inability to easily open files without executing them
is an example of a basic security vulnerability in Windows.
This is an especially glaring flaw in Windows 
because it is so easy to do this securely on everything else.
I would love to hear about something better;
<a href="https://dwheeler.com/contactme.html">please email me</a>
if you know of a better solution!
But do not hold your breath; I've had this request out for years, and
no one has pointed me to anything.
<p>
Second, make sure that troublesome filenames are handled properly,
including filenames
with whitespace (including space, tab, newline, and return).
In particular, if you&#8217;re invoking it from a Bourne shell
(like <tt>bash</tt>),
surround the variable reference with double-quotes (as you should with
any value that might contain whitespace).  In short, do it like this:
<tt>xdg-open "$filename"</tt>
<p>
Third, make sure that your invocation isn&#8217;t misinterpreted.
All of these programs have different (incompatible) option formats;
you need to make sure that a pathname isn&#8217;t misinterpreted as an option.
This is annoying with Windows, because &#8220;/&#8221; is the leading character for options
<i>and</i> a possible beginning of an absolute filename
(Unix/Linux/MacOS have more rational approaches; they use &#8220;-&#8221;, which
is trivially prefixed with &#8220;./&#8221;).
In addition, it&#8217;s often ambiguous whether or not an argument is a filename
or a URL.
<p>
There are three basic possibilities:
URLs, absolute pathnames (that start from the filesystem root), and
relative pathnames (that start from the current directory):
<ol>
<li>
If you&#8217;re handing off a URL, just make sure it looks like one: it should
start with PROTOCOL:/... where PROTOCOL is an alphanumeric name
that begins with a letter (a-z or A-Z).
All of these programs presume that if a parameter looks like a URL,
it&#8217;s a URL (even if it isn&#8217;t).
Make sure it&#8217;s a protocol they can handle; http:, https:, and ftp:
are basically universal.
In every one I&#8217;ve tested, file: is correctly treated as a local filename.
<li>
Absolute pathnames on Unix, Linux, and MacOS are easy - they always
begin with &#8220;/&#8221;, so just pass them in that way.
Absolute pathnames on Windows are more annoying to deal with, because they
can look like URLs (e.g., &#8220;c:/hello&#8221;) or like option flags
(e.g., &#8220;/select&#8221;).
On Windows a possible solution is to use the &#8220;file:&#8221; prefix, which will
force the string to be interpreted as a file.
If you convert a filename to a file: URL, make sure you convert all
&#8220;%&#8221; characters to &#8220;%25&#8221;, or it will be misinterpreted.
<li>
If it&#8217;s a relative pathname, make sure it does <i>not</i>
look like anything else.
In particular, make sure it does not look like
a URL or an option.
When in doubt, prefix any relative pathname
with &#8220;./&#8221; to make sure it is interpreted correctly.
In particular, if the relative pathname begins with &#8220;-&#8221;, prefix it with &#8220;./&#8221;;
that is especially important on Unix/Linux/MacOS, but it&#8217;s even
relevant for Windows (many Windows programs also use &#8220;-&#8221; as the
option prefix).
</ol>
<p>
As noted above,
if you convert a pathname to a file: URL, make sure you convert all
&#8220;%&#8221; characters to &#8220;%25&#8221;, or it will be misinterpreted.
<p>
Finally, beware of just arbitrarily accepting opening a file;
opening /dev/zero (on Unix/Linux) or COM1: (on Windows) can cause trouble.
In many circumstances this is not a big deal (if the user can
just shut down the hung process), but in a few cases it can cause more
serious problems.
It&#8217;s best if you do <i>not</i> run these with root/admin privileges,
because an attacker can then cause more trouble if they can get
an arbitrary filename viewed.
<p>
And with that, there you go, a simple way to open up files,
directories, and URLs.

<p>
<h1>A simple script</h1>
<p>
If you do not use Windows, or can trust the files that you open and/or execute,
here's a simple shell script
to figure out how to invoke the current user's browser.
Remember: Don't do this on Windows if you can't trust the file.
There's a program called "<tt>open</tt>" on some systems that is completely
different, so we'll try that command only if others do not work out:

<pre>
#!/bin/sh
# ...
# Figure out how to invoke the current user's browser.
# See: https://dwheeler.com/essays/open-files-urls.html
viewer=FAIL
for possibility in xdg-open gnome-open cygstart start open ; do
  if command -v "$possibility" &gt;/dev/null 2&gt;&amp;1 ; then
    viewer="$possibility"
    break
  fi
done
if [ "$viewer" = FAIL ] ; then
  echo 'No viewer found.' &gt;&amp;2
  exit 1
fi
# Now $viewer is set, so we can use it.
"$viewer" "$FILE_OR_URL_TO_VIEW"
</pre>
