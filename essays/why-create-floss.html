<h1 class="title">Why Release Free-Libre / Open Source Software (FLOSS or OSS): For Businesses and Governments</h1>

Free-libre / Open Source Software (FLOSS, aka OSS/FS or OSS) is
software whose license gives
users the freedom to run the software for any purpose, to study and modify the software, and to redistribute copies of either the original or modified software (without having to pay royalties to previous developers).
FLOSS has risen to great prominence, and many organizations use FLOSS.
My paper
<a href="https://dwheeler.com/oss_fs_why.html">
Why Open Source Software / Free Software (OSS/FS, FLOSS, or FOSS)?
Look at the Numbers</a>
gives many quantitative figures justifying why you should consider
FLOSS whenever you need software.

<p>
But why would anyone <i>release</i> FLOSS software?

 I think the quick answer is, "when there's some reason to do so".

 A business would generally _not_ release as FLOSS software that it intended to
 sell as a proprietary product using a proprietary business model,
 or is custom code that is its key competitive advantage.

 But businesses develop a lot of software that isn't in those categories.
 The failure rate of proprietary software business is very high, as is
 the capital necessary to start and sustain it.
 "Competitive advantage" often has a remarkably short life, after
 which it's a _cost_ not a _benefit_.

 There's a lot of software where you would like to _reduce_ the cost
 of maintenance by sharing those costs, or increase innovation in it
 by cooperating with others. Apache is an example.

 Or, you'd like to make money with it, but it's better to make it via other means
 (like support). Red Hat Enterprise Linux is an example here.

 Governments have an additional issue: Often they fund research,
 and want it to get picked up by others for commercialization.
 A good way is to release it as OSS; then commercial companies can
 pick up support.

 Hope that helps.
