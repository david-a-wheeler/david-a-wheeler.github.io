<h1>How to Throw a Matrix Party</h1>
My family and friends, who know I love <i>The Matrix</i>, decided to
throw a surprise birthday party for me with a Matrix theme in May 2003.
I was impressed, they were <i>really</i> creative.
In fact, they were so creative that I
suspect others might want to throw one like it.
So, if your loved one likes the movie series too much, here's one way
to give them a fun surprise.
I'll describe this from the viewpoint of the victim (me).
<p>

On the door was a nice big Matrix-style poster declaring that
"The Matrix has you".

When I walked in, I found a TV tray with two bowls of jelly beans:
one with red beans (with a sign saying "Take the Red Pill") and
one with blue beans ("Take the Blue Pill").  I took the red pill, of course.
The tray also had a set of (water) guns to choose from.
Everyone was wearing black clothes and shades, and were sporting
the water guns and toy cell phones.
They immediately handed me my cell phone and special "secret agent pistol"
(another water gun).
I quickly went to change into the black T-shirt and pants that seemed to
me completely necessary :-).

Parties <i>require</i> food, but the table's spread had signs explaining
all the contents.  Here were the signs, and the contents (all based
on references to <i>The Matrix</i>):
<ul>
<li>"Really Good Noodles" - noodles
<li>"Everything tastes like Chicken" - chicken
<li>"Steak" - Steak, of course
<li>"Kung Foo Kabobs" - well, this is cheating, but they wanted some fruit
<li>"Follow the White Rabbit Food" - Veggie tray of carrots, celery, etc.
I thought this was really clever.
<li>"There is no Spoon" - forks and knives.
There <i>was</i> a separate container for spoons, too,
but those spoons were plastic -- so they weren't real (grin).
<li>"(Not) Everything the Body Needs" - tapioca pudding
(a personal favorite -- it looked just like the goop they eat aboard the Neb,
and I'm partial to tapioca pudding anyway)
<li>"Have A Cookie" - chocolate chip cookies
</ul>

<img width="347" height="600" src="Trinity_Trinity_and_Trinityelf.jpg" alt="Lots of Trinities">
<p>
All the decorations (streamers, balloons, tablecloths, etc.) were
black and green.
The black and green cake had a matrix-like screen on top
(made with colorflow) saying "Happy Birthday" in matrix-like letters.
My age was in there (in binary), but I won't admit it here :-).
The gift collection included several books on <i>The Matrix</i> and philosophy,
and the big gift was a Sony Playstation 2 with the <i>Enter the Matrix</i>
videogame (an excellent PS2 game, by the way; that and Baldur's Gate
are really quite good).
