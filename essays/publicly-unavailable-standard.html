<h1 class="title">Publicly Unavailable Standard (PUS)</h1>
<h2 class="author">David A. Wheeler</h2>
<h2 class="date">2025-09-19</h2>
<p>
For purposes of this document, a
"Publicly Unavailable Specification" or "Publicly Unavailable Standard" (PUS)
is a specification or standard that
can't be viewed and applied, freely <i>and</i> immediately,
by anyone using the Internet and a URL.
Typically these failures occur because
there's a required fee to view it, or it requires registration for access, or
it requires special extraction tools or formats
(so it can't be viewed on the mobile devices used by many).
This is in contrast with a
"Freely Available Specification" or "Freely Available Standard" (FAS).
For purposes of this document, a FAS is a specification or standard
that <i>can</i> be viewed and applied, freely and immediately,
by anyone using the Internet and a URL, without restrictions like fees or
registration or special extraction tools or special formats.
You'll also see the term
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_standard"
>"Free standard" or "libre standard" or "public standard"</a> in use.
<p>
Historically standardization required people to accept PUSs.
That's because distribution of standards required the use of a printing press
and experienced people to set the type.
Old standards organizations like ISO and IEC long predate the Internet,
and they <i>needed</i> this mechanism.
However, things have changed.
We now we have the Internet which can freely distribute standards
information.
Yet many still permit legacy pre-Internet processes that release PUS.
<p>
Many standards bodies already exclusively
release FASs as defined here (available to all without fees,
registrations, or other restrictions).
This includes the IETF (who define the internet standards), OASIS,
W3C, and many more.
<p>
Unfortunately, some organizations still use this legacy process
and will sometimes release a standard as a PUS.
That's a problem, since that means most people who are <i>supposed</i> to
be applying that standard cannot practically read or use them.
If there was only one standard, it wouldn't be so bad, but modern society
requires an endless number of standards.
<p>
What's worse, PUS use tends to spread. One PUS is rarely enough, because a PUS
usually cites other PUSs, which then cite other PUSs. These create
a web of PUSs, each of which costs over 100 dollars or 100 Euros.
This web ensures that most potential users
cannot afford to see or use the ones that apply to them.
PUS tends to create two worlds, a small "haves" world who can see the PUS,
and a much larger group who effectively cannot.
Some in that second group can cope by disobeying copyright law.
However, requiring people to disobey the law as a practical matter
is not something <i>anyone</i> should condone.
<p>
Some ask "how can you fund standardization?" - a question I find amusing.
Many standards bodies like the IETF have been developing standards
for decades without
<i>any</i> of those standards requiring the release of PUS, and
<i>all</i> standards bodies freely release <i>some</i> standards.
It's true some organizations have not modernized, but that's an organizational
problem.
Almost, most people who develop the standards are typically
not paid by the standards bodies,
standards development is often <i>already</i>
paid for by other means.
Governments and large organizations already pay for the work to develop
standards; they shouldn't need to pay twice.
<p>
In addition, standards and specifications are basically laws in modern society.
I believe laws should not be secret and
visible only to those who have the money to afford to read the law.
In fact, I think most citizens in democracies believe that
laws that people are subject to should be available to all, without restriction.
There's long been a tension about standards bodies creating secret laws,
and there's an increasing view in democracies that they're not acceptable.
One dodge is saying
that a standard is "voluntary", but this
is rather dubious when in <i>practice</i> it's the primary way
conformity to a law must be demonstrated.
Democracies <i>should</i> be wary of laws and quasi-laws that
are not freely available to all.
This is increasingly happening.

<li>In the US,
<i>American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM), et al. v. Public.Resource.Org, Inc. (PRO), 82 F.4th 1262 (D.C. Cir. 2023)</i>,
<a href="https://www.seyfarth.com/news-insights/the-district-of-columbia-court-of-appeals-recent-significant-legal-precedent-carries-implications-for-standards-organizations.html"
>"the plaintiffs, ASTM, National Fire Protection Association (NFPA), and American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE), are standards development organizations...
[and] often become legally binding when incorporated by reference into federal regulations. However, they are not always easily accessible by the public...
the DC Circuit’s recent opinion ultimately affirmed that PRO’s posting of standards incorporated by reference into law constituted fair use.</a>
<a href="https://www.copyright.gov/fair-use/summaries/amsoc-publicresourceorg-dccirc2023.pdf">as noted by the US Copyright office</a>,
"The court held that non-commercial dissemination of technical
standards incorporated by reference into law was fair use."
Note that the court didn't say there was no copyright, but instead, that
copyright was trumped by societal need and different use.

<li>In the EU, the "Malamud ruling" by the European Court of Justice (ECJ)
stemmed from similar concerns.
<a href="https://www.ibf-solutions.com/en/seminars-and-news/news/iso-and-iec-standards-in-the-eu-official-journal"
>"The plaintiffs had demanded that harmonised standards in the EU
Official Journal must be freely accessible at no cost as part of
EU law. The ECJ upheld this claim on 5 March 2024:
'Every EU citizen and every natural or legal person must be granted access to documents held by the EU Commission. In the case in question, the requested documents form part of EU law, as the EU Commission has given them legal effect by publishing them in the EU Official Journal.'"</a>

<p>
I should note that
many use the term "publicly available standard"
to mean a freely available standard (e.g., see what <a
href="https://standards.iso.org/ittf/PubliclyAvailableStandards/index.html">ISO</a> used for its URL).
I don't use the term PAS here, because I want to avoid confusion.
There's been a lot of effort to redefine the term PAS to something else.
I suspect one reason for this push for redefinition is that the older
PAS definitions implicitly admitted that a PUS is not publicly available.
I'm not using the term PAS here to avoid confusion.
<p>
I'm very pro-standards.
Standards are <i>critically necessary</i> for today's modern world.
We <i>need</i> standards organizations like ISO and IETF.
We should profusely thank the many standards organizations throughout
the world for the hard work they've done that's
been important for modern society.
I do my best to obey whatever laws are in place, as well as whatever
rules are in place in that organization when I work with them, and I believe
others should do the same.
However, that doesn't mean we need to <i>stay</i>
with obsolete processes.
In the long term we need to help these important organizations
adapt to modern times.
The problem is PUS.
We now have an Internet. We don't need any more PUS.
