<h1 class="title">Publicly Unavailable Standard (PUS)</h1>
<h2 class="author">David A. Wheeler</h2>

<p>
For purposes of this document, a
"Publicly Unavailable Specification" or "Publicly Unavailable Standard" (PUS)
is a specification or standard that
can't be freely and immediately viewed and applied
by anyone by using the internet and a URL, typically because
there's a required fee, or it requires registration, or
it requires special extraction tools (so it can't be viewed on mobile devices).
This is in contrast with a
"Freely Available Specification" or "Freely Available Standard" (FAS);
for purposes of this document a FAS is a specification or standard
that <i>can</i> be freely and immediately viewed and applied
by anyone by using the internet and a URL, without restriction like fees or
registration or special extraction tools.
You'll also see the term
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_standard"
>"Free standard" or "libre standard" or "public standard"</a> in use.
<p>
Historically standardization required people to accept PUSs.
That's because distribution of standards required the use of a printing press
and experienced people to set the type.
Old standards organizations like ISO and IEC long predate the Internet,
and they <i>needed</i> this mechanisms.
However, now we have the Internet,
yet we still have legacy pre-Internet processes that release PUSs.
<p>
Many standards bodies already exclusively
release FASs as defined here, meaning, available to all without fees,
registrations, or other restrictions.
This includes the IETF (who define the internet standards), OASIS,
W3C, and many more.
<p>
Unfortunately, some still use the legacy PUS process to release standards.
That's a problem, since that means most people who are <i>supposed</i> to
be applying the standards cannot practically read or use them.
If there was only one standard, it wouldn't be so bad, but modern society
requires an endless number of standards.
<p>
What's worse, PUS tends to spread. One PUS is rarely enough, because a PUS
usually cites other PUSs, which cite other PUSs. These create
a web of PUSs and ensure that most potential users cannot
afford to see or use them.
PUS tends to create two worlds, a "haves" world who can see the PUS,
and another group who cannot.
Some in that second group cope by ignoring copyright.
However, requiring people to disobey the law as a practical matter
is not something <i>anyone</i> should condone.
<p>
Some ask "how can you fund standardization?" - a question I find amusing.
First, most people who develop the standards are typically
not paid by the standards bodies, so what's most important is <i>already</i>
paid for by other means.
Many standards bodies like the IETF have been developing standards
for decades without
<i>any</i> of those standards requiring the release of PUS, and
<i>all</i> standards bodies freely release <i>some</i> standards.
In addition, standards and specifications are basically laws in modern society.
Societal laws should not be secret and
visible only to those who have the money to afford them.
Laws that people are subject to should be available to all, without restriction.
Governments and large organizations already pay for the work to develop
many standards; they shouldn't need to pay twice.
<p>
I should note that
many use the term "publicly available standard"
to mean a freely available standard (e.g., historically <a
href="https://standards.iso.org/ittf/PubliclyAvailableStandards/index.html">ISO</a>).
I don't use that term here, because
there's been a lot of effort to redefine the term PAS.
I suspect one reason for this push is that this older definition of PAS
implicitly admits that a PUS is not publicly available.
To avoid confusion, I'm using different terms.
<p>
I'm very pro-standards.
Standards are <i>critically necessary</i> for today's modern world.
We <i>need</i> standards organizations like ISO and IETF.
We should profusely thank them for the hard work they've done that's
been foundational for modern society.
However, in the long term we need to help these important organizations
adapt to modern times.
The problem is PUS.
We now have an Internet. We don't need any more PUS.
