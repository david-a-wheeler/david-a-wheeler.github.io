<h1>What are Open Standards? Defining the term "Open Standard"</h1>
by <a href="https://dwheeler.com">David A. Wheeler</a>, 2005-02-11

There are many different definitions of the term "open standard";
most are trying to describe the same thing, but each definition
emphasizes different aspects.
Still, having different definitions can create confusion.
By merging different definitions together,
I've developed a definition of the term "open standard"
that I think defines the term well and meets the requirements
of <i>many</i> different definitions.
This article presents this merged definition, and then shows
how this merged definition was determined.

<h1>What&#8217;s an Open Standard?</h1>

An open standard is a specification that meets the following criteria:
??? list



<h1>Existing Definitions of Open Standard</h1>

How did I find the definition above?  The short answer is that
I found several different definitions, and merged them
together so that a specification would have to meet <i>all</i> of
their requirements.
I did this earlier in my article
<a href="https://dwheeler.com/essays/opendocument-open.html">Is OpenDocument an Open Standard? Yes!</a>; this is a broader attempt
to do so.

<p>
???
Let&#8217;s first look at the two definitions of
&#8220;open standard&#8221; that seem to be the most widely used.
The first is by Bruce Perens; the second is by
Ken Krechmer (Fellow of the International Center for Standards Research).
These two are so widely used that when I did a Google search on
&#8220;open standards&#8221; these were the second and fourth results
respectively (the
first and third were OASIS and the W3C, two standards bodies that
create open standards).
We&#8217;ll then look at the European Commission&#8217;s definition
of open standards, which is a formally approved definition of
the term (and one that European governments use).

<p>
???
Then, after we&#8217;ve looked at these three definitions,
we&#8217;ll create a merged definition that includes <i>all</i> of their
requirements (from all three sources).
That way, if the specification meets this merged set of requirements, we
can be very confident that we have an open standard; such a specification
would meet <i>all three</i> definitions.


<h2>Perens</h2>

<p>
A very popular definition of the term &#8220;open standards&#8221; -- according
to Google the most popular -- is
<a href="http://perens.com/OpenStandards/Definition.html">
Bruce Perens&#8217; &#8220;Open Standards: Principles and Practice&#8221;</a>.
You&#8217;re best off reading the actual paper for its full content, of course.
Let me summarize it by quoting its list of principles that it states
a specification must meet to be an open standard:
<ol>
<li>Availability: Open Standards are available for all to read and implement.
<li>Maximize End-User Choice: Open Standards create a fair, competitive market for implementations of the standard. They do not lock the customer in to a particular vendor or group.
<li>No Royalty: Open Standards are free for all to implement, with no royalty or fee. Certification of compliance by the standards organization may involve a fee.
<li>No Discrimination: Open Standards and the organizations that administer them do not favor one implementor over another for any reason other than the technical standards compliance of a vendor&#8217;s implementation. Certification organizations must provide a path for low and zero-cost implementations to be validated, but may also provide enhanced certification services.
<li>Extension or Subset: Implementations of Open Standards may be extended, or offered in subset form. However, certification organizations may decline to certify subset implementations, and may place requirements upon extensions (see Predatory Practices).
<li>Predatory Practices: Open Standards may employ license terms that protect against subversion of the standard by embrace-and-extend tactics. The licenses attached to the standard may require the publication of reference information for extensions, and a license for all others to create, distribute, and sell software that is compatible with the extensions. An Open Standard may not otherwise prohibit extensions.
</ol>

<h2>Krechmer</h2>

<p>
Another popular definition is the set of
<a href="http://www.csrstds.com/openstds.html">
requirements for open standards created by
Ken Krechmer</a>, Fellow of the International Center for Standards Research
(University of Colorado).
He&#8217;s published several versions; here I&#8217;ll summarize the
February 7, 2005 version of &#8220;Open Standards Requirements&#8221;.
He looked at standards from the viewpoint of
recognized standards-setting organizations, implementors, and users,
and tried to find some middle ground merging their desires.
He claims that an open standard must meet the following requirements:
<ol>
<li>Open Meeting - all may participate in the standards development process.
<li>Consensus - all interests are discussed and agreement found, no domination.
<li>Due Process - balloting and an appeals process may be used to find resolution.
<li>Open Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) - how holders of IPR related to the standard make available their IPR.
<li>One World - same standard for the same capability, world-wide.
<li>Open Change - all changes are presented and agreed in a forum supporting the five requirements above.
<li>Open Documents - committee drafts and completed standards documents are easily available for implementation and use.
<li>Open Interface - supports proprietary advantage (implementation); each interface is not hidden or controlled (implementation); each interface of the implementation supports migration (use).
<li>Open Access - objective conformance mechanisms for implementation testing and user evaluation.
<li>On-going Support - standards are supported until user interest ceases rather than when implementer interest declines.
</ol>

<p>
Clearly, these definitions have a <i>lot</i> in common.
Ken Krechmer wrote his paper after Perens, and compares his list to Perens&#8217;.
He identifies each of Perens&#8217; 6 points, and maps them to his own list of ten
as follows:

<table border="1">
<tr><th>Perens</th><th>Krechmer</th></tr>
<tr><td>Availability</td><td>Open Documents</td></tr>
<tr><td>Maximum end-user choice</td><td>Open Access</td></tr>
<tr><td>No royalty</td><td>Open IPR</td></tr>
<tr><td>No discrimination</td><td>Open Meeting, Consensus and Due Process</td></tr>
<tr><td>Ability to create extension or subset</td><td>Open Interface</td></tr>
<tr><td>Ability to prevent predatory practices</td><td>Open Change</td></tr>
</table>
Krechmer in particular notes that Perens doesn&#8217;t include any requirement
about wanting &#8220;One World&#8221; or ongoing support.

<p>
However, Krechmer&#8217;s list has its own problems.
In particular, Krechmer&#8217;s list omits one of the most important factors
of all: the ability of <i>anyone</i> to implement the standard.
The <i>whole point</i> of open standards is to allow anyone to implement
the standard, and to allow any user to have unfettered selection and
switching between many implementations.
Krechmer&#8217;s list notes the importance of
patents and copyright (&#8220;IPR&#8221;),
but his definition allows &#8220;open standards&#8221;
to forbid competitors from implementing the standard.
This is a fundamental flaw in his definition;
defining &#8220;open standard&#8221; as &#8220;a standard
that some competitors are
forbidden from implementing&#8221; is nonsense.
It certainly conflicts many other works.
Perens&#8217; definition <i>explicitly</i> forbids this,
as does the
<a href="http://europa.eu.int/idabc/servlets/Doc?id=17982">
Valoris report</a>,
which required as a <i>minimum</i> that the format
&#8220;may be implemented in programs without restrictions, royalty-free, and with no legal bindings.&#8221;
It also conflicts with the European Commission&#8217;s definition of open
standards, which also required royalty-free use (we&#8217;ll get
to that definition in a moment).
<p>
The most economically obvious example of this conflict is
open source software (OSS).
Today, in a vast number of software markets, the dominant or #2 program
is OSS, including web servers, web browsers, mail servers, and DNS servers.
Yet OSS are legally forbidden from using royalty-bearing patented works,
so obviously specifications requiring royalty-bearing patents or other
legal restrictions preventing OSS or proprietary implementations
are obviously not open standards.
A standard cannot be &#8220;open&#8221; if it is illegal for the
dominant or #2 supplier to implement it.
<p>
This conflict between patents and open standards
only makes sense, when you think about it.
The purpose of patents are to <i>prevent</i>
competition, while the purpose of open standards is to <i>enable</i>
open competition.
The purposes of patents and open standards are fundamentally in conflict.
Open standards are <i>not</i> the same as open source software;
you can choose open standards and use only proprietary software.
But selecting open standards lets you choose between implementations,
including OSS, and lets you switch to another implementation later.

<h2>Valoris Report</h2>

<a href="http://europa.eu.int/idabc/servlets/Doc?id=17982">
Europe&#8217;s &#8220;Valoris report&#8221;</a>
defines an open standard this way:
&#8220;The minimum requirements for an open standard are that the document format is completely described in publicly accessible documents, that this description may be distributed freely and that the document format may be implemented in programs without restrictions, royalty-free, and with no legal bindings.&#8221;


<h2>European Commission</h2>

The European Commission (EC) has defined the term
&#8220;open standards&#8221; as part of the final version 1.0 of the
<a href="http://europa.eu.int/idabc/en/document/3761">
European Interoperability Framework</a>.
<a href="http://trends.newsforge.com/article.pl?sid=04/11/19/148236">Newsforge
ran a short article</a> about it.
The EC declared that &#8220;to attain interoperability in the context of
pan-European eGovernment services, guidance needs to focus on
open standards&#8221; -- in other words, the EC views
the use of open standards as a significant policy issue.
They define the following as &#8220;the minimal characteristics that a
specification and its attendant documents must have in order
to be considered an open standard&#8221;, and I quote them here:
<ul>
<li>
The standard is adopted and will be maintained by a not-for-profit organisation, and its ongoing development occurs on the basis of an open decision-making procedure available to all interested parties (consensus or majority decision etc.).
<li>
The standard has been published and the standard specification document is available either freely or at a nominal charge. It must be permissible to all to copy, distribute and use it for no fee or at a nominal fee.
<li>
The intellectual property -- i.e. patents possibly present -- of (parts of) the standard is made irrevocably available on a royalty-free basis.
<li>
There are no constraints on the re-use of the standard.
</ul>
<p>
The document also suggests that open source software (OSS) compliments
open standards.
It says: &#8220;Open Source Software (OSS) tends to use
and help define open standards and publicly
available specifications.
OSS products are, by their nature, publicly available specifications,
and the availability of their source code promotes open,
democratic debate around the specifications, making them both more
robust and interoperable.
As such, OSS corresponds to the objectives of this Framework
and should be assessed and considered favourably alongside proprietary
alternatives.&#8221;
Both the definition and explanatory text make it clear that
the intent was that any open standard must be implementable by both
OSS and proprietary programs,
especially given the requirements for
royalty-free use and lack of constraints on re-use.

<!--
There are many other possible sources for a definition of open standard.
One interesting one is
http://www.oio.dk/files/040622_Definition_of_open_standards.pdf
Denmark's National IT and Telecom Agency, which defines a
"completely open standard" as:
A completely open standard has the following properties:
- It is accessible and free of charge to all
- It remains accessible and free of charge
- It is accessible free of charge and documented in all its details
But this was back in June 2004; I suspect this has been superceded
by the EC definition which came afterwards.
Thus, no point in describing THIS one too; the document is long enough.
-->

<h2>French Law</h2>

French law specifically defines the term "open standard."
The Official Journal n° 143 of June 22, 2004 published the
<a href="http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/WAspad/UnTexteDeJorf?numjo=ECOX0200175L">
law n° 2004-575 of June 21, 2004 (NOR reference: ECOX0200175L)</a>.
There, in title I (freedom of communication on line),
Chapter I (communication with the public on-line), Article 4 states the
following:
"On entend par standard ouvert tout protocole de communication,
d'interconnexion ou d'échange et tout format de données interopérable
et dont les spécifications techniques sont publiques et sans restriction
d'accès ni de mise en œuvre."
<p>
<a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/171341/">A translation could
read this way:</a>
"An open standard is defined as any communication, interconnection or
exchange protocol, or any data format, that is interoperable and for
which the technical specifications are public and without restrictions on
access or on implementation."
<p>
<a href="http://formats-ouverts.org/blog/2004/07/01/12-UnArticleDeLoiDefinitCeQueSontLesFormatsOuverts">On formats-ouverts.org,
Thierry Stoehr clarifies this further</a> (my translation):
<ul>
<li>The protocols and data formats are independent of any particular software implementation, operating system, or company.
<li>The technical specifications are documented, publicly published, and not require payments.  There must be no patent licensing or royalty payments.
</ul>
<!--
Cela signifie donc :

    * des protocoles et des formats de données indépendants d'un logiciel particulier, d'un système d'exploitation ou d'une société
    * des spécifications techniques documentées, publiées, non payantes, sans brevet dessus, sans royalties dessus.
Cela signifie donc :

    * des protocoles et des formats de données indépendants d'un logiciel particulier, d'un système d'exploitation ou d'une société
    * des spécifications techniques documentées, publiées, non payantes, sans brevet dessus, sans royalties dessus.
-->

<p>
This definition omits the creation or evolution of the standard,
which is important to having a true <i>practical</i> open standard,
but it's a simple and clear definition.

Is ODF an Open Standard? ~ by David A. Wheeler (Groklaw)
(Posted Feb 11, 2006 13:46 UTC (Sat) by subscriber lolando) (Post reply)

There's [an article in] a French law that speficically defines an open standard. It goes something like (translation mine): "An open standard is defined as any communication, interconnection or exchange protocol, or any data format, that is interoperable and for which the technical specifications are public and without restrictions on access or on implementation." It's weaker than the criteria mentioned by David Wheeler, because it doesn't mention evolution of the standard (or its creation process), but I find it remarkably simple and to-the-point.

<h2>Open Format (Massachusetts)</h2>

Massachusetts has defined the term "open format" with essentially
the same basic goals as most other people who have defined the
term "open standard."
Although their definition only concentrates on data formats, it is
trivially extended to any IT standard.

<!--
http://www.mass.gov/eoaf/open_formats_comments.html
Informal comments on Open Formats
Eric Kriss, Secretary, Administration &amp; Finance
Commonwealth of Massachusetts
January 15, 2005
Massachusetts Software Council annual meeting
Emphasizes "open formats" - limiting to just formats, and
confusing obsolete definition of open stds.

We will extend the definition of Open Standards to include what we will be calling Open Formats. Open Standards, as you know, are specifications for systems developed by an open community and affirmed by a standards body. An example is XML, a method of exchanging data.

(Misleading statement above, so omitted).
-->

They define an "open format" as a specification for data file formats
which is
"based on an underlying open standard,
developed by an open community, and affirmed by a standards body;
or de facto format standards controlled by other
entities that are fully documented and available for
public use under perpetual, royalty-free,
and nondiscriminatory terms."
He gives TXT text and PDF document files as examples.

<h2>Wheeler</h2>
In
<a href="http://www.groklaw.net/article.php?story=20051029212458555">an
earlier paper</a> I noted that,
&#8220;When you think &#8216;open&#8217;, think &#8216;open competition&#8217; or &#8216;open market.&#8217; An open standard should allow competition based on merit, instead of limiting customers&#8217; suppliers to one particular supplier or a subset of suppliers based on their business model, development model, licensing model, and so on. You should be able to replace one product that does the same function for another, as long as they meet the same open standard, and achieve at least the same basic function provided by the standard (though some may perform better or have additional features -- think of plug-replaceable components).&#8221;


<h2>OpenFormula</h2>

???


The fundamental goal of this OpenFormula Development Group is to "develop a specification for exchanging formulas (at least spreadsheet formulas for OpenDocument) that is implementable by ALL proprietary and open source software projects, using ANY and ALL of the common licenses, business models, and development models for them; this must be true in perpetuity for itself and any formally approved derivatives." Specifically, the specification MUST be implementable using licenses such as Microsoft's Office 2003 license, the Corel Word Perfect Office 12 Home Edition license, the GNU GPL, LGPL, MIT, BSD-new, and the MPL. Terms that are incompatible with the GNU GPL version 2 are not acceptable; terms that require the GNU GPL version 2 are also not acceptable.

People who cannot accept the fundamental goal, stated above, are not allowed to contribute.

This means you may not contribute anything encumbered by a potentially enforceable patent, to the best of your knowledge and ability. If you know of a patent (including third parties') and you believe it's possibly enforceable, you must let us know so we can avoid it. If your organization has a patent on something, they need to allow royalty-free implementation with all terms necessary to meet the fundamental goal. We understand that individuals not representing their company can only speak for themselves; that's fine. Frankly, formulas are so old it's hard to imagine anyone having or getting a patent on this kind of material, but we need to avoid the problem (and we want any later standards body to avoid patented components in later revisions).

Here are other implications:

   1. Implementations must be able to have transferable and sub-licensable licenses, and they must be allowed to implement a subset (there may be a requirement that partial implementations can't claim they implement OpenFormula in such cases, like Adobe's license for PDF). This is because OSS development models effectively require these conditions.
   2. It must be possible for implementations to not release their source code, e.g., there cannot be a "header" file that is licensed under only the GPL. This is because typical proprietary development models require this.
   3. Other legal tricks that might "lock out" an implementor are also unacceptable.
   4. Standards bodies often create test suites. These can be valuable, but they must not prevent implementations from using the test suites, or claiming conformance when they do conform. There is, in fact, a test suite built into this specification itself. We intend to require that any standards body that is granted the rights to control this specification must allow anyone to freely test against the test suite defined in the specification. What's more, any open source software implementation, or proprietary program that is made free to end-users, must be allowed to test against any test suite and to publicly claim conformance to the test suite (if true), without fee or other legal restriction. Such implementation developers may not have the economic means to pay for conformance testing, and the goal is maximum and widespread conformance, not maximum profit for standards bodies. 

We're aware that it's possible for someone to be in the process of getting a patent and no one else would know it. We're also aware that the patent office routinely grants absurd patents (such as swinging on a swing) and patents for established prior art (that's why it says "potentially enforceable" above).
Rationale: Users want to be able select any implementation; unnecessary constraints are not acceptable. An Economic Basis for Open Standards by Rishab Aiyer Ghosh discusses the need for open standards further. Groklaw summarizes that paper.
[edit]
Secondary Goals

You must strive to try to meet the secondary goals:

   1. The specification should be publicly accessible, without fee or registration requirements, by electronic means (e.g., a web address). The IETF, W3C, OASIS, Free Standards Group, and others do this; free availability has been shown to be very effective at encouraging use of a specification. That's especially important in this case, because we expect that users may need access to this specification. It's okay if a public standards body has a for-fee reformatted specification, as long as the equivalent technical contents are also freely available (examples include Ada and the Common Criteria).
   2. The specification should be VERY widely vetted, by many implementors.
   3. Eventually maintenance of this specification should be transferred to some vendor-neutral standards body/bodies such as OASIS, W3C, Free Standards Group, IETF, ECMA, or ISO. 

We can give on these secondary goals where necessary, but we think it's very undesirable to do so.

"An introduction to open computing, open standards, and open source"
developerWorks
Douglas Heintzman, Staff, IBM
05 Jul 2003

<p>


Open computing - a general and inclusive term that is used to describe a philosophy of building IT systems. In hardware, open computing manifests itself in the standardization of plug and card interfaces; and in software, through communication and programming interfaces. Open computing allows for considerable flexibility in modular integration of function and vendor independence.


Open standards - interfaces or formats that are openly documented and have been accepted in the industry through either formal or de facto processes, and which are freely available for adoption by the industry. In the context of this article the term will be used to specifically refer to software interfaces. Examples that many people are familiar with include HTTP, HTML, WAP, TCP/IP, VoiceXML, XML, and SQL. They are typically built by software engineers from various IT/software companies who collaborate under the auspices of organizations such as W3C, OASIS, OMA, and IETF.

Proprietary - describes interfaces that are developed by and controlled by a given company and have not been made freely available for adoption by the industry. Proprietary software uses non-public interfaces or formats. When an interface is non-public, the owner of the proprietary interface controls it, including when and how the interface changes, who can adopt it, and how it is to be adopted.

Open source software - software whose source code is published and made available to the public, enabling anyone to copy, modify and redistribute the source code without paying royalties or fees. Open source code evolves through community cooperation. These communities are composed of individual programmers as well as very large companies. Some examples of open source initiatives are Linux, Eclipse, Apache, Mozilla, and various projects hosted on SourceForge.

The open computing environment:
Most major companies and governments have embraced the concept of open computing. They purchase IT goods and services from a variety of vendors and expect the technologies to work together. They wish to have the flexibility to deploy hardware and software in a specific way in order to address specific business problems. They do not wish to be subjected to the priorities and schedules of any particular vendor. Open computing provides them with a way to treat technology components as discrete modules that can be mixed and matched.

<h1>Merging the Definitions of Open Standard</h1>

<p>
So let&#8217;s use a definition of &#8220;open standard&#8221; merging
the best of each, and so that a specification would meet <i>all</i>
of these definitions to qualify.
Perens&#8217; list is short and clear, but
Krechmer, includes the points &#8220;One World&#8221; and
&#8220;Ongoing support&#8221; that aren't
explicit in Perens.
Krechmer's list has a fundamental flaw:
that definition fails to require fully open
intellectual rights allows "open" standards that forbid open competition,
a serious problem that the definitions of Perens, the
European Commission, French law, and "Open Formats" do not share.
The definition by the European Commission additionally notes that
costly specifications subvert the point, French law seems to go
even further.

<p>
The result is a slightly stricter definition of &#8220;open standard&#8221;
than any of the three definitions by themselves.
Thus, so if any specification meets this merged definition,
then it&#8217;s <i>clearly</i> an open standard.


<p>


???
??? Test to show that HTML/XML, TCP/IP, and OpenDocument are open standards.



<h1>Is OpenDocument an Open Standard?</h1>

So, is OpenDocument an open standard?
Let&#8217;s walk through the list of requirements.

<ol>
<li><i>Availability: Open Standards are available for all to read and implement.</i>
This one is easy.  You can
<a href="http://www.oasis-open.org/committees/office/">download
the OpenDocument specification for free from OASIS</a>.
Absolutely anyone can implement OpenDocument; if you look at the IPR
statements, they clearly state that absolutely <i>anyone</i> can implement it,
and there are no limits at all.
<li><i>Maximize End-User Choice: Open Standards create a fair, competitive market for implementations of the standard. They do not lock the customer in to a particular vendor or group.</i>
The fundamental question here is, is this designed to permit
multiple interoperable implementations?
The most obvious way to determine if this is true is to
determine if there multiple implementations available on
multiple different platforms.
The answer to the latter question is emphatically <i>yes</i>;
there are already multiple implementations of OpenDocument, with many
more in progress.
OpenOffice.org/StarOffice and KOffice are office suite applications
that support reading and writing OpenDocument, and are completely independent
implementations.
There are also many specialized products that implement
their relevant portions, for example,
AbiWord and Writely are word processors that can read and write
the word processing portion of OpenDocument;
Gnumeric is a spreadsheet application whose implementation of the
spreadsheet portion of OpenDocument is in development.
(<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_applications_supporting_OpenDocument">Wikipedia
has a list of applications supporting OpenDocument</a>.)
You can also look at other evidence to help gain more confidence in this:
<ol>
<li>Were multiple implementors involved in its specification to
help prevent lock-in? Yes; Sun, KDE, Corel (vendor of Word Perfect), IBM (vendor of IBM Workplace and Lotus SmartSuite), and others.
I&#8217;ll discuss more about the participants later, but that&#8217;s enough to
prove the point.
<li>Does the specification maximally reuse <i>other</i> open standards
(otherwise it may end up creating unnecessary dependencies on
nonstandard components)?
Yes; other standards OpenDocument reuses include
SVG, SMIL, XSL, XForms, MathML, XLink and the Dublin Core Meta Initiative.
</ol>
<li><i>No Royalty: Open Standards are free for all to implement, with no royalty or fee. Certification of compliance by the standards organization may involve a fee.</i>
There&#8217;s no royalty or fee to implement OpenDocument, so this is met 100%.
<li><i>No Discrimination: Open Standards and the organizations that administer them do not favor one implementor over another for any reason other than the technical standards compliance of a vendor&#8217;s implementation. Certification organizations must provide a path for low and zero-cost implementations to be validated, but may also provide enhanced certification services.</i>
I believe this one is also a clear &#8220;yes&#8221;, however, it&#8217;s
more difficult
to measure this than most other points.
We&#8217;ll explore this one further in a moment, to see why I believe this
is &#8220;yes&#8221; as well.
<li><i>Extension or Subset: Implementations of Open Standards may be extended, or offered in subset form. However, certification organizations may decline to certify subset implementations, and may place requirements upon extensions (see Predatory Practices).</i>
Implementors may implement subsets or supersets of OpenDocument, without
any special requirements, so this is clearly met too.
<li><i>Predatory Practices: Open Standards may employ license terms that protect against subversion of the standard by embrace-and-extend tactics. The licenses attached to the standard may require the publication of reference information for extensions, and a license for all others to create, distribute, and sell software that is compatible with the extensions. An Open Standard may not otherwise prohibit extensions.</i>
The OpenDocument developers chose to not embed any protective
measures against subversion by external parties.
However, all the members of the technical committee that created the
standard were required to grant royalty-free licenses to implement it.
This prevented anyone from quietly inserting a requirement in the standard
and after ratification announce that they would extort payments from
implementors.
Thus, this requirement is easily met.
<li><i>One World: Same standard for the same capability, world-wide.</i>
The OpenDocument specification was specifically designed to be used
worldwide, and <i>not</i> limited to any region.
It includes capabilities to support
arbitrary locales and arbitrary languages, and in fact was developed by
representatives from many different countries.
For example, OpenDocument supports Unicode/ISO 10646 characters
(whose purpose is to support the characters of all languages),
Ruby text (important in supporting
some Asian languages), and text written from
right to left (important in supporting Arabic and Hebrew).
Reusing many open standards helps this, too.
Also, by working to avoid patented techniques, the developers
of OpenDocument made it more likely that
<i>everyone</i> in the world could use the standard (otherwise the
standard might only be usable in countries
that don&#8217;t tolerate software patents).
We&#8217;ll discuss more about patents in a moment, because patents fundamentally
conflict with the previously-noted requirement for no discrimination.
<li><i>On-going Support: Standards are supported until user interest ceases rather than when implementer interest declines.</i>
The OpenDocument standard is supported by OASIS, a standards body, rather
than any one particular vendor.  Thus, as long as there are users who
wish to support the standard, they can work with OASIS to continue its
support.
There&#8217;s absolutely no indication that this is a problem anyway; there
is a <i>massive</i> amount of interest in OpenDocument.
<li<i>No or nominal cost for specification.</i>
OASIS posts the specification at no charge on their website, clearly
meeting this requirement.
</ol>

<p>
In short, we get &#8220;yes&#8221; answers for all of these points.
All but one of them are trivially answered as &#8220;yes&#8221;.
One point, however, is harder to measure - the &#8220;No discrimination&#8221; point.
This isn&#8217;t because there&#8217;s a <i>problem</i> with OpenDocument on this point;
the challenge is that &#8220;no discrimination&#8221; is harder to measure for
<i>any</i> standard.
So let&#8217;s drill into the &#8220;no discrimination&#8221; point to see if OpenDocument
meets this requirement -- if it does, then it is
<i>clearly and unambiguously</i> an open standard.

<h1>No Discrimination</h1>

Perens requires that open standards have &#8220;no discrimination&#8221;,
that is, that
&#8220;Open Standards and the organizations that administer them do not favor one implementor over another for any reason other than the technical standards compliance of a vendor&#8217;s implementation. Certification organizations must provide a path for low and zero-cost implementations to be validated, but may also provide enhanced certification services.&#8221;
There&#8217;s no certification issue, so we don&#8217;t have to deal with that.
<p>
The European Commission had an explicit requirement that the administering
organization must be a not-for-profit, which is easy to show in this case:
OASIS is a non-profit!
<!-- OpenDocument FAQ -->
But there&#8217;s more to preventing discrimination than simply creating
a specification via a not-for-profit organization.
<p>
What about the whole first part of Perens&#8217; requirements?
<p>
Krechmer maps this single requirement to three requirements:
<ul>
<li>Open Meeting - all may participate in the standards development process.
<li>Consensus - all interests are discussed and agreement found, no domination.
<li>Due Process - balloting and an appeals process may be used to find resolution.
</ul>

One Last Thing | Setting the stage for another flop?</a>
(By Jonathan Last, Jun. 04, 2006, Philadelphia Inquirer),
says, "Consider the coming train wreck of Sony's PlayStation 3" --
everyone expect it to be a collosal failure, because it's grossly
overpriced, so why would Sony risk itself on it?
The answer - it's trying to control the video format of the future,
because they didn't learn from the failure of Betamax and other
similar attempts.

 China's viewpoint of the DVD patent pool - claims it creates a monopoly
 (cartel)

Li also expressed concern about the occasional practice of some multinationals combining patents with technical standards. He said although patents are exclusive and should be paid for if used, standards should be open and optional.

"Users of a patent pool often have to accept the specific technical standard combined with the patents, which will in a way strengthen the patent holder's clout over technical standards," he said.
