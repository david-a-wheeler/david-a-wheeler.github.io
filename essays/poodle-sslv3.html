<h1 class="title">POODLE attack against SSLv3</h1>
<h2 class="author">David A. Wheeler</h2>
<h2 class="date">2014-10-26 (originally 2014-10-14)</h2>


<p>
There is a newly-announced attack on SSL version 3 (SSLv3)
called POODLE (Padding Oracle On Downgraded Legacy Encryption).
This allows an attacker to steal tokens such as
secure HTTP cookies or HTTP Authorization header contents, and then
masquerade as the user.
More information is available in the paper
<a href="https://www.openssl.org/~bodo/ssl-poodle.pdf">This POODLE bites: exploiting the SSL 3.0 fallback</a>
by Bodo Möller, Thai Duong, and Krzysztof Kotowicz.

This vulnerability is much harder to exploit than
<a href="https://dwheeler.com/essays/heartbleed.html">Heartbleed</a> or
<a href="https://dwheeler.com/essays/shellshock.html">Shellshock</a>,
but under the right conditions it is still a bad thing.
This is <i>not</i> a vulnerability specific to OpenSSL
(as <a href="https://dwheeler.com/essays/heartbleed.html">Heartbleed</a>
was), but instead, <i>any</i> system that uses the original SSLv3 protocol
is vulnerable.

<h1>Simple solution: Disable SSLv3</h1>
<p>
In many cases the simple solution is to disable support for
the hideously obsolete SSLv3.
<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6101">SSL version 3.0
was defined in an internet draft whose last draft version was
released on November 18, 1996</a>.
The replacement for SSLv3, TLS version 1.0, was defined back in
<i>January 1999</i>, and since then the specifications for
TLS versions 1.1 and 1.2 have been released.
Every protocol update counters known attacks.
So POODLE is an attack on a cryptographic protocol that was
developed at least 18 years ago, was replaced 15 years ago, and is
three versions back from the current TLS protocol.
I think 15 years is long enough time for a transition!
It&#8217;s been known for a long time
that SSLv3 has weaknesses and security issues;
that&#8217;s why TLS superceded it long ago.

<p>
Cryptographic algorithms have a limited lifetime, because attackers
keep finding new ways to break them.
See <a href="http://valerieaurora.org/hash.html">&#8220;Lifecycles of popular crytographic hashes&#8221; by Valerie Aurora</a> for a vivid example.
The same is typically true of cryptographic protocols like SSL/TLS -
attackers will keep finding new ways to break them,
so improved cryptographic protocols need to be developed, implemented,
and deployed.
The <i>real</i> problem is that some suppliers, system developers, and
administrators are unprepared for reality - they mistakenly presume
that there is no need for easy upgrades.

<p>
As is often the case, one of the problems is Internet Explorer 6 (IE6).
IE6 does not directly support TLS 1.0 by default.
At this point, if you are a user with IE6,
it is time to upgrade or switch to a different browser.
In particular, note that
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-ca/internet-explorer/ie-system-requirements#ie=ie-8">Windows XP users can install Service Pack 2 (SP2),
and then install
Internet Explorer 8</a>,
or another browser that <i>does</i> support TLS 1.0 such as Firefox.
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security">Wikipedia&#8217;s
article on TLS has more information about web browser support for
different versions of the SSL/TLS protocol</a>.
Part of the reason that there are still so many IE6 deployments is that
people thought that ignoring the standards was okay, and that it
was acceptable to develop web applications that only ran on IE6.
Now that IE6 is a minority browser, everyone who followed the standards
is just fine... while those who wrote IE6-only applications are
making their customers vulnerable.

<p>
Google recommends supporting
<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-tls-downgrade-scsv-00">TLS_FALLBACK_SCSV</a> as the solution.
This prevents protocol downgrade attacks
on the Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol.
However, this is merely a draft - to my knowledge there is no
final specification.
This also is not universally supported.
In contrast, TLS 1.0 <i>is</i> widely supported.
Thus, I think requiring
<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-tls-downgrade-scsv-00">TLS_FALLBACK_SCSV</a> is not an immediately useful approach for addressing POODLE.

<p>
That said, supporting TLS_FALLBACK_SCSV <i>is</i> a good longer-term strategy.
<a href="https://www.openssl.org/news/secadv_20141015.txt">OpenSSL
added support for TLS_FALLBACK_SCSV on 2014-10-15</a>, and OpenSSL is
widely used.
So the good news is that we may see an improved fallback widely
implemented.

<h1>Web browsers</h1>
<p>
Each web browser has a different way to disable SSLv3:
<ul>
<li>In Firefox view &#8220;about:config&#8221; and
<a href="http://kb.mozillazine.org/Security.tls.version.*">set security.tls.version.min to at least 1</a>.
<li>In Chrome you currently have to set a command line flag
&#8220;--ssl-version-min=tls1&#8221;; it no longer has a preferences setting to do this.
Chrome will soon disable automatic fallback to SSLv3, and in a few
months they hope to disable SSLv3 completely.
<li>On Internet Explorer 9, go to Internet options, select the tab Advanced,
and uncheck &#8220;Use SSL 3.0&#8221; (your organization may override this).
</ul>

<h1>Web servers</h1>
<p>
Web servers, of course, also have different ways of doing this.
Apache server adminstrators can disable SSLv3 using SSLProtocol, e.g.,
<tt>SSLProtocol -SSLv2 -SSLv3 ...</tt> where the &#8220;...&#8221; lists the
protocols you <i>do</i> accept.
Unfortunately, you&#8217;ll have to decide if it&#8217;s okay
to reject IE6 users.


<h1 id="learned">What have we learned?</h1>
<p>
I like to try to determine <i>what have we learned</i>?
Here the lessons are easier.
<p>
In particular, it&#8217;s a waste of time
to focus too much on the technical details of cryptographic protocols.
POODLE is an attack on a cryptographic protocol
(SSLv3) that was developed at least 18 years ago,
and was replaced 15 years ago (by TLS version 1).
I think 15 years is long enough time for a transition!
Also, the fact that the older protocol (SSLv3) had issues
was no secret; that&#8217;s why a replacement was created.
<a href="https://www.dfranke.us/posts/2014-10-14-how-poodle-happened.html">&#8220;How POODLE Happened&#8221; (by Daniel Fox Franke, 2014-10-14)</a>
has a nice timeline and a brief description of known vulnerabilities
in various versions of SSL/TLS.
<p>
Instead, I think we can focus on a few real lessons:
we need to
<a href="#update-crypto">update and age out cryptographic protocols</a>,
ensure that our cryptographic protocols
<a href="#counter-downgrade-attacks">counter downgrade attacks</a>,
<a href="#verify-mac-first">verify the MAC
before doing any cryptographic operation</a>,
and
<a href="#simple-version-numbering">use simple version numbering</a>
systems.


<h2 id="update-crypto">Update and age out cryptographic protocols</h2>
<p>
Cryptographic algorithms and protocols have a lifetime.
It is best to update them, have a transition plan, and a timeline
to smoothly update them... but they do not last forever.
Frankly, it&#8217;s absurd that SSLv3 held on as long as it did.
The problem wasn&#8217;t the protocol, it was the industry&#8217;s inability
to update.
Since SSLv3 we have had TLS version 1.0, 1.1, and 1.2, each of which
fixes vulnerabilities and problems in the previous version.
Yet there are many systems that do not support protocols beyond
TLS version 1.0.
<p>
Backwards compatibility is important and valuable.
But security issues, and in particular cryptographic algorithms and
protocols, are fundamentally different than other things.
Because smart attackers look for tiny weaknesses,
you have to plan to more-aggressively <i>update</i> to new versions and
<i>retire</i> old ones.
<p>
We need to ensure that the <i>latest</i>, most secure versions of
widely-used protocols are quickly implemented in widely-used implementations
(including open source software implementation), and get
those deployed on shipping systems.
<p>
This is all well and good, but by itself this advice
ignores an important reality.
Service provider have a significant problem:
if their customers do not upgrade, then they
must support the obsolete (dangerous) protocols
or they risk losing customers.
So we need to address this head-on, as described next.

<h2 id="counter-downgrade-attacks">Counter downgrade attacks</h2>
<p>
All protocols, both in theory and as implemented, must be
<i>specifically designed</i> to prevent downgrade attacks.
This is a technical approach, and an important one.
<p>
Since cryptographic protocols and algorithms are updated to counter
attacks, attackers learned long ago that a great way to subvert systems
is to convince them to downgrade to older protocols and algorithms.
Then the attackers can reuse the older &#8220;fixed&#8221; vulnerabilities.
<p>
SSL/TLS implementations, unfortunately, were in practice
very vulnerable.
Since some old servers didn&#8217;t originally understand TLS
handshakes, the clients implemented a retry without TLS
(using SSL instead), under the assumption that the server
was so old that it didn&#8217;t support TLS.
However, this created an easy attack - an attacker could simply
block the TLS request, and clients would switch to the more-vulnerable
older protocols (SSL) instead.
If an attacker can selectively block requests, causing systems to
use a different protocol, then it doesn&#8217;t matter if there
is a more secure protocol; attackers can force systems to
use the vulnerable protocol.
<p>
<a href="https://blog.hboeck.de/archives/858-Dancing-protocols,-POODLEs-and-other-tales-from-TLS.html">Johannes (Hanno) Böck</a>
uses the term &#8220;evil protocol dance&#8221; for this
behavior, where a system just keeps trying protocols
until it finds something that works.
This behavior is reasonable when there are no security issues,
but it should never be used for security protocols because
it allows downgrade attacks.
</a>
<p>
In general,
if an attacker can force your protocol or its implementation
to downgrade to a weaker protocol when it is not necessary,
then it is busted.

<h2 id="verify-mac-first">Verify the MAC before doing any cryptographic operation</h2>

<p>
Here is another technical approach, for those who are interested
in the underlying technology.

<p>
Moxie Marlinspike recommends a useful rule-of-thumb
for designers of secure protocols that he calls the
<a href="http://www.thoughtcrime.org/blog/the-cryptographic-doom-principle/">Cryptographic Doom Principle</a>.
This principle is,
&#8220;If you have to perform any cryptographic operation
before verifying the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Message_authentication_code">[Message Authenication Code (MAC)]</a>
on a message you&#8217;ve received,
it will somehow inevitably lead to doom.&#8221;
Put another way, always verify the MAC of a message
(to detect tampering) before doing anything else with it.
<p>
SSLv3 violated this principle; it decrypts before it verifies the MAC.
This led to SSLv3 being vulnerable to the POODLE attack
(it also creates vulnerabilities to attacks devised by Vaudenay).
Moxie Marlinspike states, and I agree, that
&#8220;subtle crypo mistakes are SO easy to make&#8221; -
and this is another example.

<h2 id="simple-version-numbering">Use simple version numbering schemes</h2>
<p>
One absurd problem is that the name and version change between
&#8220;SSL 3.0&#8221; and &#8220;TLS 1.0&#8221;
has led to a lot of security vulnerabilities.
Many users presume that 3 is more than 1, and thus, that TLS 1.0 is
older than SSL 3.0.
The reverse is actually the case; TLS 1.0 <i>replaces</i> the
older SSL 3.0.
But that absurd name and version change continues to cause grief.
For example, Chrome once had a mechanism to enable and disable SSLv3,
but they removed it because too many users misunderstood which one
was older.
The result was that Chrome users (even expert ones)
became <i>less</i> safe once POODLE was revealed, because Chrome users
had no practical mechanism to disable the vulnerable protocol.
Complicated version identification schemes (aka version numbering
schemes) make it difficult for users and administrators to
<a href="#update-crypto">properly update their software and their software
configurations</a>.

<p>
<a href="http://trendingcurrentevents.com/bill-gates-count-10-windows-meme/"><img align="right" src="../images/Bill-Gates-Count-to-10-Windows-Meme.jpg" width="491" height="423" alt="Hi, my name is Bill Gates and today I'll teach you how to count to ten: 1, 2, 3, 95, 98, NT, 2000, XP, VISTA, 7, 8 10"></a>

<p>
Version numbering should be <i>really simple and clear</i>, yet
many other programs make the same mistake.
For example,
Microsoft Windows is a well known-example of a program
that has completely failed to have a simple version numbering scheme.

<p>
Another program with a shamefully complicated version numbering scheme
is <a href="http://frama-c.com/">Frama-C</a>.
Frama-C is a suite of tools for analyzing software, and it
has lot of great features.
However, here is
<a href="http://frama-c.com/download.html">the absurd sequence
of Frama-C version numbers</a>:
Hydrogen,
Helium,
Lithium,
Beryllium,
Boron,
Carbon,
Nitrogen,
Oxygen,
Fluorine,
Neon.
So... if you&#8217;re running Oxygen, is Neon an upgrade?
If you have to think about it (or look it up), your
version numbering system is too complicated.

<p>
Yet another example of bad version numbering systems is
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TeX">TeX</a>.
Since version 3 updates are indicated by adding an extra digit
at the end of the decimal to approach pi;
The most recent update (on 2014-01-12) released version 3.14159265.
This is painful to compare as well.

<p>
If you&#8217;re ever involved in a program or standard, please just keep
the version numbers (and perhaps names) consistent and simple; your users
will thank you.
People have many things to do each day;
keeping track of a complicated versioning system
is not something they want to do.

<p>
There are
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_versioning">various
approaches for identifying software versions</a>.
What you want is a system that is <i>easy</i> to use, so that it is
immediately obvious to everyone which version is older and which version
is newer.
One reasonable approach is using the release date, often
in ISO date format (e.g., 2014-10-24), but this convention
has problems if updates of older branches are ever released.

<p>
Most people use sequence-based identifiers (such as 1.1)
version identifiers, since they easily handle updates of multiple branches.
People easily understand them, and many systems already
support them as
&#8220;natural sorting&#8221; or &#8220;version sorting&#8221;
(natural sorting sorts sequences of one or more digits in numeric order,
not by character code, and may vary other things as well).
For more about natural sorting, see posts by
<a href="http://www.davekoelle.com/alphanum.html">David Koelle</a>,
<a href="http://sourcefrog.net/projects/natsort/">Martin Pool</a>,
<a href="http://blog.codinghorror.com/sorting-for-humans-natural-sort-order/">Coding Horror</a>, and
<a href="http://rosettacode.org/wiki/Natural_sorting">Rosetta Code</a>.
A useful variant of sequence-based identifiers is
<a href="http://semver.org/">semantic versioning</a> (such as 1.1.0).
Semantic versioning is
clear, and since this format always has 2 periods, version
identifiers using semantic versioning cannot be
confused with simple numbers.
Sometimes version numbers are skipped based on various superstitions
(e.g., skipping <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetraphobia">4</a> or
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triskaidekaphobia">13</a>).
Be careful: do not use the pre-release version numbering scheme
(with a hyphen) in semantic versioning.
Such version numbers are not allowed by
practically all Linux package management systems
(including rpm-based ones like Red Hat Enterprise Linux, CentOS, Fedora,
and SuSE, and deb-based ones like Debian and Ubuntu).
Other than its pre-release portion, semantic versioning makes sense.

<h1>Conclusions</h1>
<p>
In 2014 the primary problem with POODLE isn&#8217;t
technology, nor is the problem really that SSLv3 is vulnerable.
<p>
<i>The real problem is that SSLv3 is still supported at all</i>.
SSLv3 is a cryptographic protocol with known problems, has been
replaced three times with updated and more secure
algorithms, and there has been 15 years to transition away from SSLv3.
That is <i>plenty</i> of time by any definition.
SSLv3 should have no longer been in use.
<p>
We need to help and encourage systems to systematically
implement updated cryptographic algorithms and protocols, and
smartly <i>remove</i> the older and weaker ones.
These have a lifetime, just like people do.
And just like people, we need to plan for their demise.
