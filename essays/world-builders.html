<p>Many articles have been written about
the concepts behind the movie <I>The Matrix</I>,
extolling the differences between &ldquo;the real&rdquo; and &ldquo;the
unreal.&rdquo;  Let me offer a counterpoint: in the movie, the
virtual-reality matrix is a real matrix.  It's all real, from the
point of view that any environment in which people can interact is
real.</p>
<p>One of
the most distinguishing characteristics of mankind is that we are
<i>world-builders.</i>
Other animals occasionally use tools, and some animals make a specific
environmental change (e.g., beavers can create ponds), but only
humanity routinely dreams up and then implements whole new
environments to suit our desires.  In general, we most respect older
civilizations that shaped and molded their environment to suit their
needs (e.g., the pyramid-building Egyptians, the Roman Empire, and
ancient China).  Many of the most popular works of fiction present an
entirely new world (e.g., J.R.R.
Tolkien's work, or Gene Roddenberry's <i>Star Trek</i>
universe), in which others can pretend to inhabit.</p>
<p>We continue to develop new worlds &ndash;
new environments &ndash; today.  Our growing cities are not
&ldquo;natural&rdquo;; they are human-dreamed and human-created.  The
most obvious  and newer environment today is the Internet: its
services such as the World Wide Web, email, and chat systems (such as
various Instant Messaging systems and Internet Relay Chat) all
provide environments in which we can interact.  The fact that they
are electronic does not make the people any less real, and there's
nothing wrong with &ldquo;artificial&rdquo; environments merely
because they're artificially created.</p>
<p>The problem of the matrix in <i>The Matrix</i> is not that the humans
are in an artificial environment; we've been in artificial
environments ever since we built our first homes.  The problem is
that the matrix is a prison &ndash; it's an environment that people
are unaware of, and cannot (easily) escape from.  As the character
Morpheus says, it is a &ldquo;prison for your mind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The fundamental issue is that humans should
not allow environments to control them; instead, they must (continue)
to control their environments.  There is, of course, a danger that
our systems (part of our environments)
will control humankind, which is why many systems (such
as political systems, media, and so on) must be watched and it's
critical that competing points-of-view can be heard.  Even if the
environment is artificial, however, humans should still treat others
with respect.  Some people send nasty email to others they'd never
send in person, under the mistaken notion that because the
environment is (more) artificial, so are the people.  This is wrong:
what's truly real are the people around us.</p>
