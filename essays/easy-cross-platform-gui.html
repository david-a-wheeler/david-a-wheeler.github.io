<h1 class="title">Easy and Cross-Platform GUI development FLOSS tools with Unix/Linux support</h1>
<h2 class="author">David A. Wheeler</h2>
<h2 class="date">2009-02-24</h2>

<p>
There are <i>lots</i> of different ways to build programs with
graphical user interfaces (GUIs).
Here are a few of the "more major" ways that are
<a href="https://dwheeler.com/oss_fs_why.html">
(1) Free-libre / Open Source Software (FLOSS)</a>,
(2) have Unix/Linux support, and (3) are either
(a) exceptionally easy and/or (b) cross-platform.

<p>
There's no way I can summarize all the info on the net, and there's
much I've had to omit.
But there's so much out there that I ended up writing notes on the options
I found... and here they are.
I've divided into the easy/trivial (single-question) case, the
full cross-platform toolkits, and the "in between" options.

<p>
<h1>Easy/Trivial</h1>
<p>
Are your GUI needs are very simple/trivial, i.e.,
you just need to get a single question answered via a GUI?
If so, there are some some simple dialog programs
that simply ask the question using a GUI, get the answer, and return it.
That makes them really easy to put into a script, though this approach
can't support more complex approaches
(which generally require event-driven development approaches).
The two most common options on Unix/Linux are:
<p>
<ul>
<li>Zenity, which uses the GNOME/GTK+ toolkit. (An alternative is gdialog).
<a href="http://www.linuxjournal.com/content/make-your-scripts-user-friendly-zenity">Linux Journal</a> and
<a href="http://www.freesoftwaremagazine.com/columns/saving_my_sanity_zenity_shell_script_interaction_gui">Free Software Magazine</a> both praise Zenity.
<li>Kdialog, which uses the Qt toolkit (used by KDE).
</ul>
<p>
There are some other "dialog" programs too, including the text-only dialog.
Zenity "works" in its non-native environment, but not as
pretty in the "wrong" one.
(<a href="http://www.mail-archive.com/debian-jr@lists.debian.org/msg01627.html">
kdialog can "hang" in the "wrong" environment</a>).
There really should be a single dialog program, with a single interface,
that calls out to the "right" program based on the active environment.
Perhaps it should be added to
<a href="http://portland.freedesktop.org/wiki/XdgUtils">XdgUtils</a>,
just like xdg-open and so on (call it "xdg-dialog").
This has been discussed
<a href="http://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/portland/2006-April/000380.html">by the Portland group in 2006</a>, and
<a href="http://www.mail-archive.com/desktop_architects@lists.linux-foundation.org/msg00207.html">by Dan Kegel in 2008 via the Linux Foundation mailing list</a>.
<!--
https://lists.linux-foundation.org/pipermail/desktop_architects/2008-February/002583.html
Xdialog depends on gtk and seems abandoned.

https://lists.linux-foundation.org/pipermail/desktop_architects/2008-February/002583.html
says zenity for GNOME, kdialog for KDE,
"xmessage" is available for the rest but ugly/fragile result.

"Thunar" is a file manager; you can create "custom actions" in it:
  http://thunar.xfce.org/pwiki/documentation/custom_actions
which is hobbled by the lack of a standard dialog:
  http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=435800

-->
The Perl <a href="http://cpansearch.perl.org/src/KCK/UI-Dialog-1.08/README">
UI-Dialog</a> does this, but it requires perl and perl programming
(instead of a simple command-line interface).
<!--
Perl module can use:
  (with DISPLAY env): Zenity, GDialog, XDialog, KDialog
  (without DISPLAY): CDialog, Whiptail, ASCII

-->
<!--
Note: kdialog will hang for a long time when run on a non-KDE desktop,
because it's waiting for dcopserver. A solution is to test for dcopserver,
and if not there, start kdeinit.

kind of thing with Python.

<p>
<h1>Cross-Platform Toolkits</h1>
<p>
If those approaches are inadequate, you'll be doing more work, at which
point you'll probably be interested in cross-platform GUI toolkits
(so you don't have to re-do the work).
There are many options, which can be grouped on the basic toolkit or language,
as shown below.
Once you pick a toolkit/language, there are often lots of choices
related to it... with the result that choosing can get complicated.

<p>
Note: Many people recommend using GUI user interface designers
(aka GUI builders/designer)
that generate a bunch of data files; these files describe forms and what
function/method to call given various events.
Then, you create a very small program that loads and implements them.
This makes it much easier to change the user interface,
as well as being able to support more programming languages.
(Glade does this for GTK+, for example).

<p>
Here are some of the options available, with the first few being
especially relevant:
<ol>
<li><a href="http://wxwidgets.org">wxWidgets</a>:
This is the cross-platform GUI library I hear the most about.
This supports Unix/Linux (using GTK+), MS Windows, and MacOS X.
wxWidgets maximally uses the "native" platform widgets,
so the generated applications "look" right to end-users.
You can also access platform-specific capabilities when you want to.
It's implemented in C++, but there are bindings to other languages.
In particular, the
<a href="http://www.wxpython.org/">wxPython interface</a>
lets you use Python (which is <i>much</i> simpler to use);
if you use wxPython, read the
<a href="http://wiki.wxpython.org/wxPython%20Style%20Guide">
wxPython Style Guide</a>.
For wxWidgets UI building, there's
<a href="http://wxformbuilder.org/">wxFormBuilder</a>;
and wxGlade.
Both can generate "XRC" files (an XML format that is a standard
part of wxWidgets)
that can be later loaded to generate a form.
has some limitations on its XRC support.
wxGlade was inspired by Glade, but doesn't share any code with Glade.
<a href="http://sturlamolden.blogspot.com/2008/03/howto-using-wxformbuilder-with-wxpython.html">This page
provides "HelloWorld" for Python + wxFormBuilder + wxWidgets</a>.
<a href="http://wiki.wxpython.org/index.cgi/XRCTutorial">Here's more about
wxPython + XRC (XML Resource)</a>.
<a href="http://wiki.wxpython.org/XrcStartingPoints">Here's a simple
sample Python program that loads the GUI defined using XML</a>.
<a href="http://www.xminc.com/linux/wxpython.html">Many people, after
looking around, end up with wxWidgets + wxPython</a>.
If you want a full IDE that supports wxPython,
PythonCard and spe do that (and there are yummable Fedora packages).
PythonCard says that it is "for you if you want to develop
graphical applications quickly and easily with a minimum of effort and coding."
There's also
<a href="http://boa-constructor.sourceforge.net/">Boa Constructor</a>,
which supports wxPython, but there's no Fedora package.
<!--
http://pythoncard.sourceforge.net/
PythonCard is a GUI construction kit built on wx, tries to make simple
things simple, HyperCard-like.  Project seems stalled; last change 2006.
-->

<li>GTK+:
GTK+ is the basis of GNOME, so GTK+ applications look 100% at home on GNOME
(the default UI of Fedora and Ubuntu).
GTK+ applications work on KDE but can look odd.
GTK+ applications also run on Windows and MacOS.
Historically, GTK+ didn't use many native widgets, but that seems to have
changed;
also, MacOS X originally required X (making it very odd-looking), but again,
this seems to have changed.
It's built with C, but of course there are lots of
<a href="http://www.gtk.org/language-bindings.html">GTK+ language bindings</a>
(including PyGTK for Python).
In the GTK+ world,
<a href="http://www.micahcarrick.com/12-24-2007/gtk-glade-tutorial-part-1.html">
Libglade to GtkBuilder F.A.Q.</a> explains that libglade is getting
replaced by gtkbuilder.
Basically, libglade's dynamic loading capability is getting moved into GTK+
itself as <a href="http://blogs.gnome.org/johan/2007/06/15/gtkbuilder-has-landed/">GtkBuilder</a>, so GTK+ will have a standard format for loading
GUI builder files... and some cleanup was done for the transition.
<a href="http://glade.gnome.org">Glade</a>
will eventually generate gtkbuilder XML directly, but in the meantime, you need
to run a converter program (not a big deal).
<a href="http://www.micahcarrick.com/12-24-2007/gtk-glade-tutorial-part-1.html">Here's a GTK+ and Glade tutorial</a>.
<a href="http://gazpacho.sicem.biz/">Gazpacho</a> is an alternative to Glade.
<a href="http://www.gtk-server.org/">GTK-server</a>
offers a stream-oriented interface to the GTK+ libraries, which could be
very useful (especially for shell scripts).

<!-- http://crow-designer.sourceforge.net/  Crow Designer - not
under active development, according to its website. -->
<!--
"guiloader" is a small program that loads an XML description and creates
the necessaries in GTK+.

http://www.gnope.org/
GNOPE combined PHP and GTK+

"EasyGtk" is a thin wrapper on the C interface; appears dead.
-->
<li>Qt:
Qt is a toolkit that works across many platforms, and is the basis of KDE.
Qt has had licensing issues in the far past, and more recently was
a dual license (GPL or proprietary, the latter for a fee).
It's to be released under the LGPL, which I applaud.
Qt is implemented in C++ with several non-standard extensions (so isn't
really a standard language at all);
I really dislike this implementation approach, but many others are
fine with it.
Historically, Qt emulated the native look (leading to discrepancies), but
more recent versions of Qt tend to use native widgets.
"Qt Jambi" is an interface to Qt for Java.
<li>Java: Java has some extra decisions.  For Java-native interfaces
you can choose Swing (reference GUI for J2SE)
or Standard Widget Toolkit (SWT), developed by IBM as part of Eclipse.
There's also the older AWT, though that's much less capable.
<a href="http://www.developer.com/java/other/article.php/2179061">
Here is developer.com's comparison of SWT and Swing</a>, and
<a href="http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/grid/library/os-swingswt/">
IBM developerWorks' article on SWT, Swing, and AWT</a>.
SWT tries to be close to the native platform; Swing tries to abstract
away from it.
AWT is much older; it's a simple toolkit with limited capabilities, but
it does have the advantage of stability.
<a href="http://www.thinlet.com/index.html">Thinlet</a> (GPLv3)
is a GUI toolkit for J2SE.
<li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/XULRunner">Mozilla's XULRunner</a>, which is used by Firefox and Thunderbird (among others).
XULRunner separates the run-time infrastructure
of programs like Firefox and Thunderbird
so you can build your own apps with them.
Firefox and Thunderbird are clear demonstrations that this works;
anyone who has Firefox already has XULRunner installed.
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Getting_started_with_XULRunner">
Here's how to get started with XULRunner</a>.
<li>Tk (often combined with the language Tcl).
Many years ago, this is what you'd probably use to create a
cross-platform GUI app.
Tk still works, and it's a relatively easy toolkit to use.
However, Tk hasn't gotten as much support recently.
It doesn't use many native widgets, so resulting applications
don't look "native" on any platform; indeed, they tend to look
ugly and dated.
There are bindings to Tk to lots of languages (including Python).
Though it's not required, Tk is often used with Tcl.
Tcl is a remarkably simple language (and thus its implementation is tiny),
but that has its downsides;
it parses each command at a time (so errors aren't noticed ahead of time), yet
it re-parses them each time (making it slow).
Richard Stallman famously wrote "Why you should not use Tcl", kicking off a
<a href="http://www.vanderburg.org/OldPages/Tcl/war/">Tcl war</a>.
<li><a href="http://www.fltk.org/">Fast Light Toolkit (FLTK)</a> is a small
cross-platform C++ GUI toolkit for Unix/LInux, MS Windows, and MacOS X.
It's small enough that the library is often included statically in
an executable, so if that's important, that's a big plus.
On the negative side, it is completely its own toolkit, so resulting
applications don't look native on <i>any</i> platform
(unless only FLTK is used).
<li><a href="http://www.fox-toolkit.org/goals.html">Fox toolkit</a> (LGPL).
This does <i>not</i> wrap native toolkits.
<li><a href="http://www.gnustep.org/">GNUstep</a> (LGPL).
This is based on the Cocoa API (Formerly OpenStep) originally
created by NeXT (now Apple), it has a large library of reusable components.
<a href="http://www.gnustep.it/Renaissance/index.html">GNUstep
Renaissance</a> is a development framework, emphasizing human-editable XML.
Applications run on Linux, Unix, Windows, MacOS.
<li>HTML.
Just a reminder - perhaps you should be writing a web application instead.
Then you don't have to deal with this at all :-).
XForms is a newer approach for HTML forms, which might be useful.

There are lots of data sources on the topic.

Seems to have stalled, but still an interesting project!



Here's a rant related to Ruby, but probably obsolete:
 http://wonko.com/post/a_brief_comparison_of_cross-platform_gui_toolkits_from_rubys_per
<p>
There are some interesting older pages available on cross-platform GUI toolkits,
including
<a href="http://www.atai.org/guitool/">this list at atai.org</a>
<a href="http://ask.slashdot.org/comments.pl?cid=1011628&amp;sid=5809&amp;tid=156">This Slashdot comment</a>.
One thing that everyone agreed on was that you should look at
<a href="http://wxwindows.org/">wxWindows</a> if you're doing it.
(for Python, see <a href="http://www.linux.com/feature/145949">this article</a>) are two approaches.
For more sophisticated needs,
glade (possibly combined with
<a href="http://autoglade.sourceforge.net/">autoglade</a>) can help.
-->

<p>
<h1>In-Between</h1>
<p>
For many circumstances, you'd like to create an input form that people
can fill in, and then when they accept the form something happens.
(all the values get returned, or a command line program is run with various
option flags set).
Ideally, you'd fill in the information or use a GUI form builder to
create an XML form.
Then, an "executor" would run the form, and when 'go' is pressed, run
the command.
The existing GUI desigers/builders already provide much of this functionality.
<p>
Surprisingly, I don't see much that does this exactly.
A close one is
<a href="http://kommander.kdewebdev.org/">Kommander</a>, which <i>appears</i>
to only work with KDE (corrections wanted) and thus not really
cross-platform.
It uses the Qt toolkit.
<p>
<a href="http://everygui.sourceforge.net/index.html">EveryGUI</a>
gets close to this too; it's based on the GTK+ toolkit.
"EveryGui is an attempt at being a GTK+ Graphical User Interface for
'Everything' (involving command line programs) on UNIX systems. This
goal is achieved by providing two powerful applications:
<ol>
<li>
Chameleon, which is a dynamic GUI for virtually any tool or OS command. It
loads config files of tools which are chosen from a list, and dynamically
creates widgets reperesenting the tools' options. Not only does it
execute the commands, but it can save a batch of commands into a shell
script for later/repeated use.
<li>
And Designer, which is a visual environment for creating/editing
config files that determine Chameleon's different behaviours for each
tool/command. Designer feels like a cross between QT Designer and Glade,
but requires no coding at all to get the functionality working (that's
Chameleon's job to do it automagically)."
</ul>

<p>
<a href="http://commandlinegui.codeplex.com/">Command line GUI project</a>
at complex may get there, though there's no release (since October 2006!)
and it may be Windows-only if it ever is.
"Before the Command Line Gui application can present you the input fields for a command line executable it needs to know all about that executable and its command line arguments. Details about the command line arguments of the executable in question are stored in an xml file. This file contains information about the location of the executable, the command line arguments that can be used and binding directions how to represent them in the Gui. You can put one or more executables in one xml file and have multiple xml files to choose from. For now the xml file has to be created by hand."
<p>
<a href="http://easygui.sourceforge.net/">EasyGui</a> is a Python
library built on top of Tk that lets you create a form, have the user
fill it out, and then return.
It support
"quick and dirty GUI features (for)
GUI capabilities that don't require any knowledge of Tkinter, frames,
widgets, callbacks or lambda... all GUI interactions are invoked
by simple function calls.
EasyGUI is different from other GUIs in that EasyGUI is NOT event-driven.
It allows you to program in a traditional linear fashion, and to
put up dialogs for simple input and output when you need to."
<a href="http://showmedo.com/videos/series?name=IwrOgqPc9">There
are videos showing how to do this</a>.
<p>
In Perl, the perl-Getopt-GUI-Long uses an interesting approach - it's
a getopt()-like library that automatically creates a (simple) GUI
for setting options.
<a href="http://mail.python.org/pipermail/getopt-sig/2002-April/000140.html">
Automatically creating a GUI from Python's getopt was also briefly
discussed</a>, and
<a href="http://jonebird.com/2006/04/18/getopts-morphed-into-a-gui/">
other people have had this idea too</a>.
<p>
<a href="http://ask.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=00/08/11/2052243&mode=thread">
Here's a discussion about making a GUI pipe</a>.
<p>
Such a tool could proabably built quickly from other tools, particularly
by generating XML and then writing a simple standard "driver" program that
ran the XML.
Ideally, it'd use a really small/simple scripting language, and
would work without a lot of bigger programs, so that you could quickly
install the driver on many different systems.

<p>
<a href="http://estron.alioth.debian.org/">Estron (formerly DWI)</a>
is a platform for making GUI applications using SQL eaiser.
Based on GTK+ and Glade.
"Estron is a fairly simple environment for quickly creating data-driven applications, that is, graphical applications that manipulate and show info from a database. This environment differs from others in that it is focused on native GTK/Gnome support through the Glade GUI designer, and thus allows you to build user interfaces as elegant as you can make them in Glade."

<p>
<a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~bam/uicourse/830fall04/centgraf.EasyToolkitsLecture.ppt">
'Easy' GUI Toolkits by Peter Centgraf</a> has a nice discussion about
approaches for creating GUIs, pointing out major themes
(edit visually, simplify the model, and use a high-level language).
<p>
<a href="http://hotwire-shell.org/">Hotwire</a>
is an "object-oriented hypershell", and tough to explain without using it.
<a href="http://www.linux.com/feature/121743">This Linux.com article
explains Hotwire through examples</a>.
The Hotwire site explains that it is a (command) shell "designed
for systems programming (files, processes), and thus it is
in the same conceptual category of software as the Unix shell+terminal
and Windows PowerShell..
The goal of the Hotwire project though is to create a
better systems programming shell than both Unix and PowerShell.
We call it a hyper-shell because Hotwire blends the concepts of a systems-oriented shell with a modern graphical user interface display.
It takes advantage of your desktop environment rather than being a text box.
It retains some advantageous attributes of a shell such as
keyboard command orientation, interactivity, completion, and scripting."
