Here are some tips on how to secure your Microsoft Windows system,
if you&#8217;re a home user, small business user, or other small
organization user (such as small non-profits).
</i>


<p>
<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>
Since I work in computer security
I occasionally get asked by Microsoft Windows
users questions like
&#8220;I got this strange error message -- do I have spyware?&#8221;
or &#8220;How do I keep my [Windows] computer secure?&#8221;
Large businesses employ people who secure computer systems as a full-time job,
but that doesn&#8217;t help if you&#8217;re a home or small business user.

<p>
<h1>Why Should you Secure Your Systems?</h1>
<p>
You can&#8217;t ignore the problem -- if you ignore security, and connect
to the Internet,
your Windows machine will almost certainly have serious security problems,
and soon.
One study found that
<a href="http://www.avantgarde.com/xxxxttln.pdf">
an unpatched Windows XP system only lasted 4 minutes on the Internet
before it was compromised.</a>
The
<a href="http://www.staysafeonline.info/news/safety_study_v04.pdf">
&#8220;AOL/National Cyber Security Alliance Online Safety Study&#8221; of
October 2004 determined that 80% of Windows users were infected by at least
one spyware/adware product.</a>
Many organizations such as
<a href="http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/04_40/b3902115_mz070.htm?chan=sb">BusinessWeek have reported on spyware</a> and other Windows
security problems.
Researcher
<a href="http://www.freerepublic.com/focus/f-news/1312830/posts">
Ben Edelman did a test where he installed one WindowsMedia video file,
and through its digital rights management mechanisms it deceptively installed
31 spyware/adware programs</a>
He noted that "All told, the infection added 58 folders,
786 files, and an incredible 11,915 registry entries to my test computer.
Not one of these programs had showed me any license agreement,
nor had I consented to their installation on my computer."

information about spyware if you're curious</a>).

The top six reasons that Explorer crashes</a> aren't traditional defects -
they're side-effects of a virus infection

Attacks are more serious now, because they&#8217;re not longer
just kids&#8217; pranks.
<a href="http://www.businessweek.com/technology/content/feb2006/tc20060202_832554.htm">BusinessWeek reported in February 2006</a> that
profits from cyber crime were higher than profits from the sale of illegal
drugs for the first time in 2005.

From ACM Tech News:

It's Time to Arrest Cyber Crime
Business Week (02/02/06) Horn, Paul

Profits from cyber crime were higher than profits from the sale of illegal
drugs for the first time last year, according to Valerie McNiven, the U.S.
Treasury Department advisor.  "Cyber crime is moving at such a high speed
that law enforcement cannot catch up with it," McNiven says.  Cyber crime
is now driven by profit with an estimated 85 percent of malware created
specifically for profit.  The FBI lists fighting cyber and technology crime
at number three on its list of top 10 priorities.  Since cyber criminals
are becoming more organized, experts say a new approach to fighting cyber
crime is needed in three key areas: people, policies, and technology.  The
"people factor" aspect of the solution is figuring out how hackers work and
what makes them tick.  Behavioral insight will help fight intrusions as
well as extrusion into the network.  Policy is another issue that must be
dealt with by organizations by establishing expectations for behaviors and
outcomes in order to create a secure business environment.  The
implementation of security policies allows companies to protect their data.
More than 40 organizations recently came together to form the Data
Governance Council, a group designed to go beyond the traditional
approaches to security, privacy, compliance, and operational-risk policy.
Technology such as encryption is another challenging issue companies must
face and learn how to extend it to every touchpoint on the network.  It is
estimated that more than half of all corporate data is on someone's PC,
PDA, or cellular phone.  Cyber crime is now the crime of the 21st century,
but with the right people, policies, and technology in place, it can be
fought, writes IBM Research vice president Paul Horn.

NetworkWorldFusion stated in December 13, 2004</a> that
&#8220;a spyware program can send corporate data directly from your
company&#8217;s client computers to an Internet-based data collection facility,

It also said that
&#8220;some spyware sends captured data to North Korean intelligence agency servers.
The North Korean government analyzes what it captures,
sells the data to criminals and organizes international distributed
DoS attacks.
South Korea&#8217;s defense ministry recently said that North Korea
has trained more than 500 computer hackers to wage cyber-warfare
against the U.S.
The ministry reported that North Korean militant hackers,

penetrating the computer systems of the U.S., South Korea and Japan,
are among the best in the world.&#8221;

Upgrading to the Vista version of Windows will solve it all, right? No.
<a href="http://blogs.govexec.com/techinsider/archives/2007/03/is_that_windows_system_safe.html">
Experts agree that Vista will continue to have vulnerabilities</a>.
Ben Fathi, the former head of Microsoft's security group and now
the chief of development in the Windows core operating system group,
said at the RSA Conference 2007 in San Francisco last month that
if Vista had half the security vulnerabilities that Windows XP had,
he would consider Vista reaching a "great goal."
Eugene Spafford, executive director of the Purdue University Center for Education and Research in Information Assurance,
says that Windows is inherently insecure, which is why the market for
"anti-virus software, intrusion detection systems and firewalls is so huge".
Graham Cluley, senior technology consultant for Sophos PLC, said,
"What isn't in doubt is that there will continue to be flaws
found in Microsoft Vista."
In May 2007 <a href="http://www.crn.com/software/199701019">extensive
testing by CRN determined that users of Windows Vista and Windows XP
"are equally at risk to viruses and exploits and that overall Vista brings only marginal security advantages over XP...
Vista's security failed to impress Test Center engineers.
Vista remains riddled with holes... [offering]
no improvement in virus protection vs. XP, [and] little or no security gains
over its predecessor against such threats as RDS exploits, script exploits, image exploits, VML exploits, malformed Web pages and known malicious URLs".</a>
In
<a href="http://www.computerworld.com.au/index.php/id;128348660;fp;16;fpid;1">
May 2008, John E. Dunn's article "Vista laid low by new malware figures"
stated that
"Vista's reputation for improved security could be heading for
the pages of history... new figures appear to back up [PC Tools'] claim that Vista is almost as vulnerable as its predecessors...
[27% of all Vista machines probed] were compromised by at least one piece
of malware over the six months to May 2008.</a>
Don't confuse nagging with security;
<a href="http://neosmart.net/blog/2008/ireboot-and-working-around-uac-limitations/">
iReboot's developers conclusively demonstrated that
"Windows Vista ... [makes software development] more complicated
without actually providing any any further protection for end users
from malware"</a>.
Vista certainly isn't making
<a href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=FVbf9tOGwno">everyone happy, with
its many incompatibilities</a>.
Indeed, many organizations have decided that Vista (and/or Office 2007)
is a bad investment - it creates numerous incompatibilities with the
rest of the world, costs a lot of money (e.g., because of forced hardware
updates and retraining), so much so that
<a href="http://www.infoworld.com/article/08/01/14/02FE-why-save-xp_1.html">
in 2008, InfoWorld stated that "XP must be saved"</a>.
<a href="http://www.computerworld.com/action/article.do?command=viewArticleBasic&articleId=9112885">One-third of Vista users downgrade it to XP in 2008, says
one report</a>; another says that
<a href="http://practical-tech.com/uncategorized/vista-adoption-going-no-where-it-considering-linux-and-mac-instead/">in June 2008, 60% of IT administrators
have no plans to deploy Vista</a>. There are even statements that
<a href="http://www.vnunet.com/vnunet/news/2229275/comment-pdc-suggests-vista-dead">Vista is 'dead'</a>; it'll sell, but mostly because it comes
pre-installed or via forced upgrades.

<h1>What is this Paper all About?</h1>
<p>
I&#8217;ve created this page to give you, the home or small business user,
a few simple things to do that will help make your existing system more secure.
This paper is for those who don&#8217;t know much about computers,
or for those who
normally use an operating system other than Microsoft Windows but suddenly must
secure a Microsoft Windows system.
I hope you find this information helpful.
You don&#8217;t have to do every step, but I&#8217;ve tried
to describe what will
happen if you don&#8217;t, so you&#8217;ll know what you&#8217;re risking.
<a href="http://www.theinquirer.net/?article=24690">Some argue it's
easier to constantly buy new machines to get rid of the spyware</a> -
a better way is to keep it off in the first place.

<p>
Many tips are independent of what system you use, but many
other tips are unique or more important to Windows users.
Many independent observers agree that Windows has the
worst security record of all operating systems, unfortunately.
<a href="#alternativeos">You can
eliminate the many Windows-specific vulnerabilities addressed here
by switching to an alternative product</a>;
even
<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/07/technology/07tips.html?_r=1&oref=slogin">
The New York Times' "Tips for Protecting the Home Computer" by John Markoff
in 2007</a> noted that
using a non-Windows system is a defense worth considering.
I always urge people to consider their options before making a decision --
it's just the smart thing to do!
Nevertheless, for purposes of this paper I'll presume that you've chosen to
use Microsoft Windows, for whatever reason, and that you
want to reduce your risks to something manageable.

<p>
The basic ideas here are actually quite simple.
We want to
create a set of layered defenses (such as by using firewalls),
avoid adding or running arbitrary (untrusted) programs,
replace programs that have a bad security track record
(particularly Internet Explorer and Outlook) with more trustworthy
programs, and keep up with patches.
These are all my own opinions -- I represent no one here -- but I offer up
these ideas in the hopes that they&#8217;ll help others protect their systems,
based on experience.

<p>
In this paper, &#8220;small business&#8221; includes small non-profits like
churches, schools, civic groups, and consortiums.
I&#8217;ll use the term &#8220;Windows&#8221; (with the initial capital
letter) as an abbreviation for Microsoft Windows;
the term &#8220;windows&#8221; is actually a generic computing
term that predates Microsoft&#8217;s product by many years.

<p>
I&#8217;m not an anti-Microsoft person, and please don&#8217;t
read this text as &#8220;Microsoft is always bad.&#8221;
Indeed, I applaud Microsoft for recently training their developers in how
to write secure software (a task their developers didn&#8217;t know
how to do), and I hope that future products will be more secure
(though <a href="http://www.healconsulting.com/Documentation/security.html">
some have pointed out reasons to be skeptical</a>).
But I&#8217;ll also condemn decisions they&#8217;ve made
that harm their customers when they've occurred.
It&#8217;s no secret that this has occurred; even
<a href="http://www.vnunet.com/news/1135763">Microsoft&#8217;s
Craig Mundie admitted that their products
were &#8220;less secure than they could have been&#8221;
because they were &#8220;designing with features in mind rather than security&#8221; --
even though most people didn&#8217;t use those new features.</a>
For security, users need to follow some guidelines (to mitigate
the problems), replace those products, or suffer the consequences.

It's not my focus, but using CCleaner and setting MyDefrag to run once a week
improve performance and make performance loss more obvious.

I am actually quite impressed with the amount of good feedback I've had from friends and relatives when I've done a PC repair/clean/rebuild for them.

I've taken the attitude with them that if I fix stuff for them free-of-charge then I don't want to have them come back again in a hurry.

This means they get the following:

- Firefox installed with a few good addons like Adblock, Xmarks (if they've more than 1 PC so they can sync bookmarks) and Flashgot

- If they have Norton or McAfee installed, I ask their permission to remove it and tell them not to renew their licenses; in place go AVG Anti-Virus and Spybot S&D for adware defence

- With their permission, replace hooky copies of MS Office & Photoshop with OpenOffice and GIMP

- Show them how to use CCleaner and set MyDefrag to be running once or twice a week

I've been amazed at the number of people who have come back and told me how trouble-free their PCs have been as a result.

<p>
Not sure what any of these tips mean?  Here is more detail about each one:
<p>


<ol>
<li><a name="nokidsrooms"></a><b>Don&#8217;t let computers in kids&#8217; rooms, or highly sensitive business locations, have access to the Internet.</b>
Many people balk at this suggestion, but I list it first because
it can eliminate a whole host of other problems.
Consider it seriously; you may find it&#8217;s not as hard as you think,
especially for young children or for really sensitive information.
<p>
Home users can feel free to
use child filters/blockers (sometimes called porn blockers),
but they <i>should not depend on blockers.</i>
In my experience such blockers
don&#8217;t work well enough to be relied on;
they don&#8217;t filter what you want them to,
and they filter out material that you <i>do</i> want them to have
access to.
You just can&#8217;t depend on them.
Worse, parental filters do nothing to stop stalkers from interacting
with your kids, which I think are a much worse threat to your children.
So don&#8217;t even put a network or wireless card into computers you
can't easily monitor.
Instead, make sure that any Internet access is limited to public
access areas (like a family room or living room) or adult-only areas
(like the parents&#8217; bedroom or office).
This is probably less practical as the kids get much older, but particularly
for small children, just tell them those are the house rules;
they&#8217;ll live!
Then talk with and monitor your kids, just like you'd talk with and
monitor them in physical public settings.
<p>
You can add filters as well, of course.
<a href="http://dansguardian.org/">Dan's guardian</a> is freely available
and is open source software.
However, the program itself runs on Linux or BSD, so you need to create
a Linux or BSD system to run it, and then have the Windows systems
access the Internet through it.
<p>
A different kind of filter is one involving web search engines.
Start by logging in as your child and then
set their search engine's preferences.
For Google,
<a href="http://www.google.com/preferences">set their Google SafeSearch
preferences to use strict filtering</a>.
For AltaVista,
<a href="http://www.altavista.com/web/ffset?ref=Lw">
set the AltaVista family filter</a>.
<p>
If you run a business, you may have some highly sensitive data that you
don&#8217;t want copied or modified.
If it&#8217;s really sensitive, don&#8217;t connect the machine holding
that data to the Internet at all;
make it a stand-alone computer, and use floppies, CD-ROMs, USB sticks, or
other media to send data in and out.
You can encrypt and decrypt data on that machine, using
secure encryption algorithms like AES or 3DES, and then send/receive
encrypted files.
You can share passwords and keys using other means
(such as an initial face-to-face meeting).
If you can&#8217;t do that, at least give it only brief Internet access,
and set your firewall to really limit what it can do... but that&#8217;s a far
less effective method.
Today computers are cheap, and dedicating a disconnected
computer (or even a small network) to especially sensitive information
is one of the most effective measures to prevent and
limit the damage of many attacks.

<p>
<a name="ownaccount"></a>
<li><b>Limit and isolate privileges: Make sure everyone has their own user account on shared computers,
don&#8217;t give most of them &#8220;admin&#8221; (Administrator) privileges
if you can help it, and rename the Administrator account.</b>
If everyone logs into a computer separately, then your settings
won&#8217;t be unintentionally shared.
Even better, on Windows NT, 2000, 2003, XP, and later, having separate
unprivileged accounts will really
help security since these systems try to enforce user separation.
<p>
Unfortunately, many Windows
programs (especially many games, educational programs, and custom programs
used by businesses)
won&#8217;t run on these later systems without admin privileges -- if they
run at <i>all</i> on later versions of Windows.
There are historical reasons for this.
Earlier versions of Windows Windows didn't support the notion
of unprivileged accounts, and even now
many Windows application developers do not develop and test their
programs to see if they'll work without admin privileges.
Indeed,
<a href="http://www.pcworld.com/resource/article/0,aid,120314,pg,1,RSS,RSS,00.asp">Keith Brown, author of <i>Programming Windows Security</i>,
reported in 2005 that 70% of all Windows applications
cannot be run without admin privileges.</a>
This is all in contrast to Unix-like systems (including Linux and MacOS X);
Unix-like systems have enforced security for decades, generally
<i>without</i> giving users unnecessary privileges.
As a result, application developers for those systems normally ship
products that don't require excess privileges.
This is one of the technical reasons why Windows systems
get viruses so often, while
<a href="http://www.faqs.org/faqs/computer-virus/alt-faq/part2/">
Unix-based systems essentially never see viruses</a>
(see also
<a href="http://www.users.qwest.net/~eballen1/virefs.html">
Bruce Ediger's information on viruses</a>).
<P>
If you&#8217;re a home user, you might want to set up a specially-designated
Windows system just to run the programs that require admin privileges,
and don&#8217;t connect that machine to the Internet.
It's quite reasonable to make that isolated system
a Windows 95/98/ME system, especially since
so many programs don't work on later versions of Windows anyway.
Yes, people do use older systems -- at the
<a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A55207-2005Feb26.html">
end of 2004, 21% of Windows users are Windows 95/98/ME users</a>
(this study includes home users).
<a href="http://news.com.com/The+slow+road+to+Windows+XP/2100-1016_3-5746046.html?part=rss&amp;tag=5746046&amp;subj=news">A different study by
AssetMetrix of businesses found that in the first quarter of 2005,
only 38% of business PCs used Windows XP (the current version of Windows), and
48% of business PCs used Windows 2000.</a>
<p>
It&#8217;s also a good idea to rename the &#8220;Administrator&#8221; account.
This is a powerful account, and renaming it counters a few attacks without
harming normal use.

<p>
<a name="goodpasswords"></a>
<li><b>Choose good passwords, especially for the &#8220;Guest&#8221; account.</b>
Good passwords are unguessable and generally have
more than 8 characters, are not a dictionary word or based on a name you know,
and have a mixture of uppercase, lowercase, and numerals or punctuation.
Take pride in how hard they are to guess.
Maybe you trust everyone in your household, but an attacker may be
able to connect remotely so that good passwords are your only
real protection.
You need to use long passwords; short ones can often be found by programs
that simply try out all possible combinations.
<p>
When you access the web, don&#8217;t use the same password everywhere.
Instead, if you care about what the password protects,
use different passwords for different websites and
use good passwords.
At one time, it was a good practice to memorize passwords and not
write them down, but good passwords are too long and you need too
many passwords for that to be practical nowadays.
Instead, do one of the following:
<ol>
<li>
Write down the password, and store your passwords securely as though
they were cash (e.g., in your wallet).  That risks theft, however, so
I recommend another approach instead.
<li>
Use a program that encrypts the passwords, say on your PDA.
<a href="http://www.zetetic.net/solutions/strip/index.html">
For Palm PDAs, STRIP is a reasonable program</a>.
<li>
Let your web browser record your website passwords.
If you do this, you risk password theft if your browser is broken in to.
However, in my experience, people who don&#8217;t let their browsers record
website passwords often choose simpler (bad) passwords and share the
same password among different systems, and that&#8217;s even worse.
Don&#8217;t use Internet Explorer (IE) if you do this, because it's
too easy to break into IE.
Make sure your web passwords are protected by a master password if you share
your machine; that&#8217;s not a bad thing to do even if you don't
share that machine.
</ol>
<p>
There&#8217;s a &#8220;Guest&#8221; account on Windows that&#8217;s disabled
in many configurations, but some attackers exploit or manage to enable it.
So give the &#8220;Guest&#8221; account a password and leave it disabled
(this suggestion comes from
Tony Bradley&#8217;s
<a href="http://netsecurity.about.com/cs/windowsxp/a/aa100903.htm">
Microsoft Windows Security 101</a>).
There&#8217;s a serious defect in Windows XP Home edition:
according to <a href="http://labmice.techtarget.com/articles/winxpsecuritychecklist.htm">LabMice</a>,
when you disable the Guest account in Windows XP Home Edition
via the Control Panel, Windows only removes the listing of the
Guest account from the Fast User Switching Welcome screen
and the Log-On Local right.
What you really wanted to remove -- the network credentials --
will remain intact and guest users will still be able to
connect to shared resources of the affected machine across a network!
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/technet/support/kb.asp?ID=300489">
Microsoft Knowledge Base Article: 300489 says that this
horrific defect is actually intentional.</a>
The best workaround for XP Home Users is to assign
a strong password to the Guest account.

<p>
<a name="sslprivate"></a>
<li><b>When using the web,
never type information you really want private (such as the
password for a bank account) into a non-SSL encrypted page.</b>
Any Internet connection that isn&#8217;t encrypted (by mechanisms like SSL)
can be snooped by a vast number of people; treat most interactions
with the Internet and email as though you were shouting to the world.
When you&#8217;re using a web browser, you can tell if you&#8217;re using a secured
connection because the URL address will begin with &#8220;https://&#8221; and
you&#8217;ll see a &#8220;lock&#8221; symbol.
If you don&#8217;t see those things, don&#8217;t type in a password you care about.
Otherwise, snoopers can see whatever you send and receive.
An SSL connection doesn&#8217;t protect you against some problems
(the person on the other end may be a fraud, or be taken over by an
attacker, or leak your private information), but it at least
prevents snoopers from easily capturing critical information.

<p>
<a name="antivirus"></a>
<li><b>Get anti-virus and anti-spyware programs.</b>
If you don&#8217;t use Microsoft&#8217;s operating systems,
you just don&#8217;t have
a virus problem, and you&#8217;re very unlikely to have
a spyware problem either.
Non-Windows systems are designed to prevent viruses, the vectors for
spyware aren&#8217;t as easy to exploit either, and there are fewer
attackers who target non-Windows systems
(it&#8217;s not just market share;
<a href="https://dwheeler.com/oss_fs_why.html">Apache
has triple the market share,
yet fewer security problems, than Microsoft&#8217;s competing IIS</a>).
There are some viruses for other systems, but since their designs resist
them, they just aren&#8217;t a serious issue for anyone else.
Apple Macintoshes have some, though not many; for Linux and Unix they
simply don't happen in the real world.
So this is a Windows-unique recommendation, since nobody else has this
as a serious problem.
<p>
But if you use Microsoft Windows to access the Internet,
you <i>must</i> deal with viruses and spyware.
Windows systems are heavily attacked,
and in my opinion, they don&#8217;t do a good job defending themselves.
<!--
(This is particularly versions before XP SP2, but even in SP2 it's much harder
to run practically without admin privileges, etc. compared to
competing products.)
-->
Microsoft has recently added DRM capabilities
(digital restrictions management), which has made things worse;
<a href="http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,1759,1749993,00.asp">
attackers are using DRM to attack users and add spyware</a>.
In short, while they are nearly unknown elsewhere,
if you use Windows,
viruses and spyware are serious problems you can't ignore.
<p>
Most Anti-virus programs are fairly mature, and most of the well-known
ones do a reasonable job at blocking or cleaning up old (known) viruses.
One example of a reasonable program is
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AVG_%28software%29">AVG</a>,
and they have a no-cost edition.
Unfortunately,
<a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/6418965.stm">
Microsoft's own flagship product, OneCare,
is one of the worst - several independent
studies have determined that it's unacceptable for use.
Andreas Clementi, senior tester at AV Comparatives, declared after testing
that
"[Microsoft OneCare] performed very low in the test, and did not reach the minimum requirements for participation" - the only product in a large suite
that failed.
</a>
<p>
So, if you use Windows, get a reputable anti-virus system, and continuously
keep your virus software up-to-date (this usually requires
paying continuing maintenance fees).
If you are not willing to do this, consider using
another operating system instead (such as MacOS or Linux).
<p>
Anti-spyware programs, unfortunately, don&#8217;t do all that well, but the
reputable ones are better than nothing.
You should get an anti-spyware program, and then use other methods to give
additional layers of defense, since spyware is also a serious problem.
More info on anti-spyware programs is at:
<a href="http://www.firewallguide.com/spyware.htm">
http://www.firewallguide.com/spyware.htm</a>
and
<a href="http://spywarewarrior.com/asw-test-guide.htm">
http://spywarewarrior.com/asw-test-guide.htm</a>.
A
<a href="http://www.pcworld.com/news/article/0,aid,118362,00.asp">
PC World review</a> found that the reputable free programs
such as Spybot Search &amp; Destroy (S&amp;D) were better than
the heavily advertized pay-for anti-spyware programs.
<a href="http://www.nwfusion.com/reviews/2004/121304rev.html">
Network World (December 13, 2004) evaluated four anti-spyware programs</a>,
though for large enterprises (which have some different requirements such
as needing centralized management); they liked Spy Sweeper Enterprise 1.5 and
Omniquad AntiSpy Enterprise Edition 4.0. They thought that
Spybot Search &amp; Destroy did &#8220;quick, accurate elimination of spyware&#8221;
at no cost, though they didn&#8217;t like it that technical support was only
available via email (that may not matter to you).
They didn&#8217;t like InterMute SpySubtract Pro 2.5 as much, saying it had
very poor ease-of-use.
For spyware, I&#8217;ve seen good reports about Ad-aware, GIANT AntiSpyware
(now Microsoft),
Pest Patrol, Spybot Search &amp; Destroy, and Webroot Spy Sweeper.
<a href="http://www.spywarewarrior.com/rogue_anti-spyware.htm">
Be wary; a few of the &#8220;anti-spyware&#8221; programs
are made by spyware <i>makers</i>,
and will actually <i>cause</i> you problems by <i>inserting</i> spyware</a>.
If you have (or think you might have) spyware or viruses,
it&#8217;d be better to erase the hard drive &amp; re-install,
though I understand that&#8217;s very time-consuming.  But even
if you re-install, you need protective programs.
<p>
More recently,
<a href="http://microsoft.blognewschannel.com/index.php/archives/2005/01/06/microsoft-anitspyware-first-impression/">
Microsoft has bought GIANT and provides a derivative of it
as their own product.</a>
As of 2005-01-06 this is a buggy beta product, but hopefully
it will get more stable quickly.
<p>
Unfortunately, there are lots of scammers.
For example,
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MS_Antivirus_%28malware%29">
MS Antivirus</a> is a "scareware rogue anti-virus",
and in spite of its name, should <i>not</i> be confused with
Microsoft Security Essentials or Microsoft Antivirus.
This program (and ones like it) fraudulently claim that you have a problem,
and then asks you to send money to "upgrade" so it can fix the problems.
<p>
Neither anti-virus nor anti-spyware programs are perfect.
Anti-spyware software in particular is not very good at removing problems;
they&#8217;ll probably miss about half of the problems.
So, you need to take other preventative steps;
certainly don&#8217;t depend on just these programs!

<p>
<a name="firewall"></a>
<li>
<b>Make sure you&#8217;re behind an external firewall,
and turn on any built-in firewalls too.</b>
An Avantgarde study by Kevin Mitnic and Marcus V. Colombano found that
<a href="http://www.avantgarde.com/xxxxttln.pdf">
an unpatched Windows XP system only lasted 4 minutes on the Internet
before it was compromised.</a>
Windows systems without the latest patches just don&#8217;t last long when
connected to the Internet; it&#8217;s a hostile world.
I know a computer expert who tried to patch his Windows system in 2003 without
using a firewall, figuring that he&#8217;d be able to download the patches
before an attacker would find his system; he was wrong.
His system was controlled by a malicious adversary
(&#8221;0wned&#8221;) before he could even finish downloading the patches.
<p>
Buy a separate component that does firewalling for you;
don't just depend on the firewall built into some versions of Windows.
It&#8217;s likely you already have this separate component;
firewalls often come built-in with wireless hubs, cable &#8220;modems&#8221;,
and DSL modems.
While not as function-rich as dedicated firewalls, for
most home and small business owners these firewalls are quite sufficient.
Most small business&#8217; connection to their ISP includes a firewall
already (and if not, they&#8217;re easily added, and you <i>really</i>
should).
Otherwise, buy one; you may find it cheaper to buy a router or
wireless hub with a firewall, even if you only need it for one computer now
(if you buy a wireless hub, disable the radio or secure it as I
discuss below).
Alternatively, you can turn an obsolete PC
into a dedicated firewall with two network cards and
freely-available programs like
<a href="http://www.smoothwall.org/">Smoothwall</a>
(<a href="http://software.newsforge.com/article.pl?sid=05/03/04/1552242&amp;from=rss">here's a Smoothwall review</a>),
<a href="http://www.astaro.org/">Astaro</a>,
<a href="http://www.ipcop.org/">IPCop</a>,
<a href="http://www.coyotelinux.com/products.php?Product=coyote">
Coyote Linux</a>
(<a href="http://software.newsforge.com/article.pl?sid=05/03/07/1720217&from=rss">here's a review of Coyote Linux</a>), or
<a href="http://www.zelow.no/floppyfw/index.html">floppyfw</a>.
Coyote Linux and floppyfw only require a floppy drive
(no hard drive or CD-ROM needed) to run, and have trivial hardware
requirements (Coyote Linux requires a 486 or better, floppyfw requires a 386
or better); you can often find such a computer for free.
<p>
Windows XP includes a built-in firewall, and
Windows XP Service Pack 2 (SP2) turns on the built-in firewall.
You should turn on any built-in firewalls you have available as well,
but the built-in firewall of Windows is easy to disable
(particularly by spyware),
and for many versions it allows far more than it should.
So I think a typical home/small business owners shouldn&#8217;t
just depend on it.
If you just can&#8217;t afford an external firewall,
and you have a single system
that dual-boots between Windows and some other operating system,
consider disabling all network drivers in Windows as an alternative.
<p>
This is primarily a Windows problem;
other operating systems such as GNU/Linux and the BSDs
are better able to withstand attacks without a firewall
(and in fact they&#8217;re often used to implement firewalls).
There are several reasons for this.
These other systems have built-in firewalls
that are very strong and have been there for years.
Also, these other systems
don&#8217;t normally export services unless you specifically ask them to;
by not providing attackers with unnecessary services to attack,
these other systems tend to be a lot less vulnerable than Windows.
It&#8217;s a good idea to run behind a firewall for any system,
since firewalls provide some additional protection, and I&#8217;d suggest
it for any system.
But since Windows has an especially poor security record,
external firewalls are basically mandatory for Windows users.

<p>
<a name="patches"></a>
<li>
<b>Install patches.</b>
<i>All</i> systems have occasional security problems, so you need
to install security patches as they become available.
This is particularly true for Microsoft Windows, and I think it&#8217;s because
Windows has a monolithic design
(e.g., the browser is embedded in the operating system, as are major
portions of the graphical user interface).
Thus, defects that are merely minor annoyances in other systems
can become serious security vulnerabilities in Windows. C&#8217;est la vie.
<p>
Keep all programs up-to-date with any patches that are available.
But in particular, keep
<a href="http://net-security.org/malware_news.php?id=1863">
Oracle Java JRE, Adobe Reader / Acrobat, Adobe Flash,
and Microsoft Internet Explorer updated</a>.
Historically, most exploits come through those programs.
<p>
You really should back up before installing a Microsoft patch;
patches (especially Service Pack 2, aka SP2) can cause the system
to become unusable in certain cases.
But not patching (or delaying too long)
will eventually cause serious problems; someone
will exploit your system if you fail to do so (and you ever
connect it to the Internet).
Remember to firewall your system before trying to download patches!
And remember that in Windows most patches require a reboot after installation
(again, this isn&#8217;t true for most other operating systems), and dependencies
may require that you do this several times.
That means that patching can take more time to implement than
on competing systems; be sure to plan for this time.
<p>
If you use Windows XP, you should install Service Pack 2 (SP2), but
you <i>must</i> do this extremely carefully and only after you have
backed everything up.
SP2 is a <i>major</i> improvement in security and well worth it
if your system and applications will still work once it&#8217;s installed.
Unfortunately, many people have had a lot of problems with SP2.
Thus, you need to be prepared to reinstall all your data
and all your software if necessary.
Some people&#8217;s critical applications stop working, and in some cases
the entire system won&#8217;t even boot, after installing SP2.
As noted in
<a href="http://www.wown.com/articles_tutorials/Dark-Side-Windows-XP-SP2.html">
The Dark Side of Windows XP Service Pack 2</a>,
you&#8217;re more likely to be successful if you first
remove spyware, update drivers (especially if you use nVidia), and
back up your system before installing SP2.
Be prepared for extra time to get your applications running again
after installing SP2.
Some applications don&#8217;t work at all with SP2 or have limitations;
for example,
security scanners like nmap can only work on Ethernet connections when
Service Pack 2 is installed (if this is a problem for you, you&#8217;ll
need to switch to a different operating system or avoid SP2).
Use Google to find suggestions for how to configure applications that
balk at SP2.
But if you use Windows XP, <i>install SP2</i> if at all possible.
Yes, it can be painful, but security problems can be even worse.

<p>
Patching is no guarantee; attackers will attack Windows
using exploits for which there are no patches.
So you still need to do other steps.

<b>Stop using Internet Explorer (IE); switch to a different web browser
such as Firefox.</b>
Microsoft&#8217;s Internet Explorer has been the source of an endless stream
of vulnerabilities, and of patches that don&#8217;t really address
its root problems (such as allowing ActiveX components to run in certain
circumstances and being deeply embedded in the operating system).
<!--
Microsoft originally said that they won&#8217;t release a new version of
IE until 2006
(<a href="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/microsoft/2">
The Seattle Times describes Microsoft as "missing in action" from the
latest browser wars</a>),
-->
Microsoft has finally decided to upgrade their browser (after
abandoning it for years), but
<a href="http://reviews.zdnet.co.uk/software/internet/0,39024165,39210992,00.htm">ZDNet suggests that even the new Internet Explorer is not worth
waiting for</a>.
ZDNet says,
"Internet Explorer 7 for XP Beta isn't a Mozilla Firefox killer -- far from it.
Given the high expectations, we're unimpressed with the IE 7 for XP Beta."
The new IE will finally add tabbed browsing and built-in RSS support,
which have been available for years by everyone else,
but it still fails to implement web standards (like CSS).
Even worse, only those running Windows XP SP2 will be able to run it,
so everyone else needs to use an alternative anyway.
As ZDNet says,
"We're not convinced that the security features touted in IE 7 will
be enough to stave off the almost monthly security patches
required to keep IE secure"; after all, IE continues to use the
design approaches (like ActiveX) that cause so many vulnerabilities.
IE is a constant source of vulnerabilities; you&#8217;re better off switching
to an alternative.
<p>
Many others say the same thing: switch away from Internet Explorer.

He also says that
&#8220;Firefox&#8217;s security goes deeper than that.

which gives arbitrary Web sites (and any attacker who has taken them over)
control of your computer as though they were you.
It omits IE&#8217;s extensive hooks into the rest of Windows,

noted that IE has many design flaws that
fundamentally impede its security:</a>
"because IE is integrated into the Windows operating system, flaws in
IE have a greater impact than flaws in a stand-alone browser. Also,
it takes longer to create fixes (since regression testing must include
the entire operating system), and applying IE patches is often more
time-intensive and expensive (requiring reboots, for example)."

<ol>
<li>"Due to the combination of ActiveX, scripting, and its integration with the Windows operating system, Internet Explorer is more vulnerable to attack than many other browsers."
<li>"The designers of Internet Explorer have purposely turned their back on the standards designed to benefit the Internet as a whole. They have done this for years, continue to do it today, and appear to have nothing but their own interests at heart."
</ol>
<p>
Vulnerabilities have repeated with such regularity in IE that
<a href="http://www.informationweek.com/story/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=55301109">in December 2004
Pennsylvania State University issued an alert
to students and staff telling them to drop IE</a>
and use an alternative.
David Hammond's
<a href="http://nanobox.chipx86.com/ie_is_dangerous.php">Internet Explorer is dangerous</a> article explains in more detail why switching
is a good idea.
<a href="http://bcheck.scanit.be/bcheck/page.php?name=STATS2004">
Scanit's Browser Security Test group</a> found that in 2004,
98% of time Internet Explorer was vulnerable to dangerous known
remote attacks, with no patch available to prevent it,
compared to 17% for Opera and 15% for Mozilla/Firefox.
<a href="https://dwheeler.com/blog/2005/08/06/#ie-horrific">
There were only <i>7 days</i> in 2004 where Internet Explorer could be

A
<a href="http://blog.washingtonpost.com/securityfix/2007/01/internet_explorer_unsafe_for_2.html">2006 survey found that again, IE was far more
dangerous to use than Firefox.</a>
No browser is perfect, but why choose one that is so much worse than
the alternatives?
<p>
Many other security organizations have expressed serious concern.
The <a href="http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/713878">
US-CERT listed as one of its solutions to IE vulnerabilities</a>
switching to a different web browser; they report vulnerabilities in many
products, but typically don&#8217;t include switching to another
product as one of the options.
The simplest summary was that
<a href="http://www.internetnews.com/security/article.php/3374931">
US-CERT was warning Web surfers to stop using
icrosoft's Internet Explorer (IE) browser.</a>
US-CERT noted that the fundamental design of IE makes it much more vulnerable
than alternatives; it said that
&#8220;there are a number of significant vulnerabilities
in technologies relating to [IE]&#8221; and that
&#8220;IE is integrated into Windows to such an extent that
vulnerabilities in IE frequently provide an attacker
significant access to the operating system.&#8221;
<a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/3840101.stm">
Other news organizations widely noted this concern.</a>
According to Secunia, as of 2004-12-17
IE has many more unpatched yet known security vulnerabilities
compared to other widely-used browsers
(see their reports for
<a href="http://secunia.com/product/11/">IE</a>,
<a href="http://secunia.com/product/4227/">Firefox</a>, and
<a href="http://secunia.com/product/761/">Opera</a>).
The
<a href="http://www.sans.org/top20/">SANS Most Critical
Internet Security Vulnerabilities</a> lists 10 critical vulnerabilities
for Windows, and the Version 5.0 (October 8, 2004) edition includes
web browsers (#5) and mail client #9. Once you delve in, you discover
that the real dangers are really IE and Outlook, since the alternatives
don&#8217;t have many of the same problems.
SANS identifies 6 serious problems with IE, compared to alternatives:
(1) IE has a larger number of vulnerabilities than other browsers,
(2) it&#8217;s taken a longer time to patch known IE vulnerabilities (sometimes
in excess of 6 months),
(3) ActiveX and Active Scripting
can be used to bypass the security constructs of the browser,
(4) A large number of unpatched vulnerabilities,
(5) Spyware/Adware vulnerabilities, and
(6) Integration of IE into the operating system (OS) makes
the OS more vulnerable to exploitation.
SANS states that
&#8220;If using an alternative browser is not an option, consider
disabling ActiveX entirely except for internal ActiveX applets
that can be preinstalled on the machine.&#8221;
The article
<a href="http://www.bankersonline.com/security/security_browserthreat070204.html">

impacted a vast number of IE users; as a result, many IE users had their
keystrokes (including bank account information and passwords) logged
and sent to a computer in Russia.

<p>
I suggest that you switch to the
<a href="http://www.mozilla.org">freely-available Firefox web browser</a>
instead (a suggestion many others make, as you can tell above).
Firefox costs nothing, it&#8217;s more secure, and it&#8217;s
generally a better browser.
<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/12/19/business/yourmoney/19digi.html?oref=login">
Firefox has rapidly grown in market share,</a>
(with
<a href="http://weblogs.mozillazine.org/asa/archives/007574.html">
25 million downloads in just 99 days)</a>,
and
<a href="http://vtbsd.net/Firefox_Poster.pdf">lots of reviewers
like Firefox</a>.
Some
<a href="http://informationweek.com/story/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=159902316">
January 2005 statistics from Net Applications</a>
show that Firefox use has continued to
grow, while IE's usage has been steadily shrinking.
Firefox's source code and internal documentation are
publicly available and it has been widely scrutinized; indeed, the Mozilla
<a href="http://www.mozilla.org/security/bug-bounty.html">
bug bounty program</a> pays people who report critical security bugs,
and they&#8217;re given all that information to work with.
Thus, there are no &#8220;secret spying codes&#8221; in it
(people have looked!), and it has a far lower security risk.
It&#8217;s a spin-off from Netscape Navigator,
so most people have no trouble using it
(indeed, if you&#8217;ve ever used Netscape Navigator it&#8217;ll
seem familiar).
And many are supporting it; for example,
<a href="http://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20050124-4549.html">Google
employs Firefox's leading developer</a>
(see <a href="http://weblogs.mozillazine.org/ben/archives/007366.html">Goodger's blog entry</a>).
Even
<a href="http://www.scottberkun.com/blog/?p=115">one of Internet Explorer's
former developers switched to Firefox</a>.
The tabbed browsing and built-in search window capabilities alone are enough
reasons to switch, but if you don&#8217;t want viruses, spyware,
and endless pop-ups, this is a serious help. 
It has much better for standards, and
<a href="http://www.google.com/help/features.html#prefetch">Google works
more quickly with Firefox than with IE</a> (because Firefox
supports something called "prefetching").
If you're curious to learn more about how browsers work, see
<a href="http://computer.howstuffworks.com/firefox.htm/printable">
How Firefox Works</a>.
<p>
Just about any other browser
(such as Netscape and Opera) would be better too.
In a few cases websites won&#8217;t
look right, but I find that&#8217;s pretty rare, and there are many
sites IE won&#8217;t display correctly as well.
You can run IE for a specific website if you need to, and tell the site owner
to fix their website while you do
(there is even a Firefox extension, IE View that lets you view the current
page in IE if necessary).
Besides, if it won&#8217;t work for Firefox, it won&#8217;t work for most PDAs,
cell phones, TVs, and the many other gadgets that can access the web,
so they&#8217;ll need to fix their site anyway.
There are other alternatives, too, such as Opera and Mac OS Safari.
<p>
Now this does not mean that Firefox will be free of any security problem.
Firefox will have security problems too!
But past history strongly suggests there will be far fewer of them that
affect you than in IE,
which means that you greatly lower your risk by switching.
<p>
Firefox automatically disables pop-ups;
<a href="http://www.popuptest.com">pop-ups are
serious problem with most versions of Internet Explorer</a>.
Older versions of Internet Explorer let pop-ups fly through;
while XP Service Pack 2 tries to close this problem,
<a href="http://www.malware.com/flopup.html">there are still
attacks that break through Internet Explorer&#8217;s pop-up protection on SP2</a>).
<p>
Perhaps more importantly,
switching away from IE will automatically disable ActiveX, a
very good thing since ActiveX is a constant source of serious
security problems
(<a href="http://news.com.com/2009-1001-276735.html?legacy=cnet">ActiveX
has been noted as a design flaw for years, and in fact it's endemic
of the general problem that Microsoft often reuses code for new purposes
even when it's unsafe to do so</a>).
You can also disable Java and JavaScript for an additional measure of security,
but both are needed by many websites, and
they&#8217;re much less dangerous than ActiveX.
JavaScript and Java run in a &#8220;secure sandbox&#8221; that tries
to protect you from problems (and it usually succeeds),
while ActiveX components disable all application security when they run --
a key reason why ActiveX is so dangerous.
This isn&#8217;t just my opinion;
<a href="http://www.cert.org/tech_tips/malicious_code_FAQ.html">
the CERT/CC notes that ActiveX is a far greater danger than
sandboxed techniques like Java</a>, and the Department of Defense defines
<a href="http://www.defenselink.mil/nii/org/cio/doc/mobile-code11-7-00.html">
ActiveX as a Category 1</a> (maximum risk) technology.
<a href="http://www.cs.princeton.edu/sip/java-vs-activex.html">
As pointed out by Professor Edward Felten of Princeton University</a>,
&#8220;ActiveX security relies entirely on human judgement. ActiveX programs come with digital signatures from the author of the program and anybody else who chooses to endorse the program. ... The main danger in ActiveX is that you will make the wrong decision about whether to accept a program. ... The most dangerous situation, though, is when the program is signed by someone you don&#8217;t know anything about. You&#8217;d really like to see what this program does, but if you reject it you won&#8217;t be able to see anything. ... The only way to avoid this scenario is to refuse all programs, no matter how fun or interesting they sound, except programs that come from a few people you know well.&#8221;
<a href="http://news.com.com/2100-1023-268947.html?legacy=cnet">
Some of the security problems of ActiveX were demonstrated back in
February 1997 by the Chaos Computer Club (CCC)</a>.
The CCC showed that an ActiveX control that could
use Intuit&#8217;s Quicken financial software to automatically transfer money
from a user&#8217;s account to the CCC bank account.
<a href="http://www.javaworld.com/javaworld/jw-03-1997/jw-03-component.web97.html">
Microsoft&#8217;s Charles Fitzgerald, program manager of Microsoft&#8217;s Java team,
stated that
&#8220;If you want security on the &#8216;Net,&#8221; said Fitzgerald,
&#8220;unplug your computer. ... We never made the claim up front
that ActiveX is intrinsically secure.&#8221;</a>
Given today&#8217;s attacks, it&#8217;s absurd to depend on such a poor foundation.
A quick
<a href="http://icat.nist.gov/icat.cfm">search through the CVE vulnerability
database using ICAT</a> demonstrates that ActiveX is dangerous.
Yes, you can get ActiveX components signed, but that doesn&#8217;t tell you what
you need to know;  anyone can get a digital signature by paying for it.
If you use some internal application with ActiveX, work with the developer
to wean them from ActiveX quickly, or drop it quickly.
ActiveX is a bad idea anyway; its non-portability
means you can&#8217;t use it on many useful platforms that have web browsers
(including Macs, Linux, PDAs, cell phones, and so on).
But from a security point-of-view,
allowing ActiveX to run is an unacceptable risk today -- today&#8217;s
computers are under constant attack.
Intrinsically insecure ActiveX is just a bad bet.
<p>
<a href="http://www.mozillazine.org/talkback.html?article=6079">
Firefox has become such a threat that Microsoft has started developing
IE again.</a>
But there's no need to wait, and there's no evidence that the next version
of IE will actually be better (from a security point of view) than Firefox
or other alternatives.
For example,
Microsoft has not committed to disabling ActiveX as the default,
or to separating the browser from the operating system.
And security is not something you just "add in" in a few months; it
takes years, hard work, and lots of review to really create a
secure product.
It's easy to say "we'll eliminate security bugs" -- but the only real
proof is in the pudding, and Mozilla/Firefox is in a lead measured by years
from a security point-of-view.
<p>
Also,
<a href="http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,1759,1776943,00.asp">
Microsoft still hasn't committed to implementing critical web standards
(such as the W3C's CSS2),</a>
even though they were released many years ago,
others have done so, and services like
Google Maps have shown the value of supporting these standards.
Web developers have complained to Microsoft for years
about their inadequate standards support; if you switch now, you
can enjoy support for web standards right now.
Major Australian newspaper
<a href="http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2005/03/21/1111253920087.html?oneclick=true">
The Age's article "Firefox explorers"</a> discusses why supporting standards
is so important; it gives as an example Bill Robertson's
De Bortoli Wines, who switched 450 workers to Firefox
primarily because they wanted to use standards (instead of being
locked into any particular vendor's proprietary interfaces).
<p>
Oh, and if you&#8217;re not using Windows XP, or you haven&#8217;t installed
XP Service Pack 2, that means that you need to switch from IE to
something else even faster.
SP2 finally adds some helpful security capabilities, but users of
older versions of Windows will not get them without an expensive
upgrade (of software and possibly hardware too).
And there's no evidence that IE users of
Windows versions before XP SP2 will get necessary security updates of IE;
Microsoft has only announced that they're working on an IE upgrade for XP SP2.
If you're curious, you can try out things like
<a href="http://bcheck.scanit.be/bcheck/">scan-it's browser security scanner</a>
(though it's not perfect, it can be interesting).
So switch. now.

<a name="cookies"></a>
<li><b>Turn off third-party web cookies.</b>
&#8220;Cookies&#8221; are small pieces of information that a web server can send
to your browser; your browser holds them, and can resend them back
to the web server later.
They&#8217;re used for web shopping and many other web activities, to help the
store determine which shopper you are.
But because they support tracking, they can also be a privacy problem.
I suggest turning off third-party web cookies to help with that.
In Firefox, select Tools/Options/Privacy, and disable accepting third-party
cookies.
(In Firefox 2.0, select Tools/Options/Cookies;
allow sites to set cookies, but turn on the option

<a name="dontuseoutlook"></a>
<li><b>For email, switch from Outlook or Outlook Express
to something else if you can.</b>
Email programs must accept data from arbitrary people -- including
attackers in other countries -- and handle it without getting
exploited.
Outlook hasn&#8217;t done well in this regard;
internally it uses the Internet Explorer functions to display email;
see above for what that means.
<a href="http://weblogs.mozillazine.org/ben/archives/007185.html">Outlook
is actually the cause of many security problems</a>;
you&#8217;re
better off replacing it with a program that has a better track record.
Outlook Express 6 users should consider switching to something else anyway;
<a href="http://bugzilla.spamassassin.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2072">a

If you want to use a local program (like Outlook or Outlook Express),
consider using
<a href="http://www.mozilla.org/products/thunderbird/">Mozilla Thunderbird</a>;
this email reader has had many rave reviews
(such as
<a href="http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,1759,1745956,00.asp">a positive
review of Thunderbird in PC Magazine</a>,
<a href="http://www.flexbeta.net/main/articles.php?action=show&amp;id=36">
Flexbeta</a>,
and
<a href="http://www.linuxtimes.net/modules.php?name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=587&amp;page=1">
Linux Times</a>)
and has
<a href="http://texturizer.net/thunderbird/extensions/">many interesting extensions</a>.
Thunderbird doesn&#8217;t have some of the features of Outlook, in
particular, as of 2004 Thunderbird's 
calendar application (a common Thunderbird extension) is not as
capable as Outlook's.
On the other hand, Thunderbird has lots of wonderful features,
such as built-in trainable Bayesian spam filtering,
built-in support for the popular news protocols NNTP and RSS,
and the ability to view emails in the conversation format (like Gmail).
Many home users and small businesses will find Thunderbird works well
for them, and without the problems of Outlook (which uses the
Internet Explorer display components, and thus is vulnerable to many
of the same attacks).
A <a href="http://news.com.com/Mozillas+Lightning+to+strike+Outlook/2100-7344_3-5501618.html?tag=nefd.top">
News.com story noted that one company recently installed Thunderbird
on 44,000 desktops</a>.
<p>
Other options for local email reading include
the older Mozilla Mail and Netscape Mail; I use those two currently,
since they have a longer history.
In fact, there are lots of other email clients; Eudora is still common.
Novell's Evolution is probably the best email program available, period,
but it hasn't been available for Windows for a while;
<a href="http://shellter.sourceforge.net/evolution/">Shellter's
Evolution on Windows</a> is a recent port to Windows.
Many people have switched to
a web-based email system, such as Yahoo, Google, Runbox, Hotmail, and so on;
in those cases, just use your web browser
(which should not be Internet Explorer).
<p>
The CERT has suggestions such as &#8220;Don&#8217;t open unknown email attachments&#8221;,
&#8220;Don&#8217;t run programs of unknown origin&#8221;,
&#8220;Disable hidden filename extensions&#8221;,
&#8220;Disable Java, JavaScript, and ActiveX if possible&#8221;, and
&#8220;Disable scripting features in email programs&#8221;.
Switching from Outlook will automatically implement these suggestions,
at least in part, without worrying about accidentally making a mistake.
<p>
You might also seriously consider disabling HTML mail.
HTML mail has nice features, but it&#8217;s also often abused for
security exploits.

<p>
<a name="hiddenextensions"></a>
<li>
<b>Disable hidden filename extensions.</b>
Many attacks work against Windows users
by misleading the user into thinking one thing is
happening, but another is really happening.
A really common problem on Windows is that Windows often doesn&#8217;t
really display the true filename.
As a result, you can&#8217;t avoid dangerous files.
<a href="http://www.cert.org/incident_notes/IN-2000-07.html">Implement
this CERT incident note so that hidden filename extensions are displayed.</a>


<p>
<a name="noprogramsviaemail"></a>
<li>
<b>Never run programs sent via email.</b>
If someone emails you a &#8220;neat program&#8221;, delete it instantly,
even if you know the person.
The email may have been forged.
That other person may have had their system taken over by a malicious
program, and now their system is sending out malicious programs to
everyone in their address book.
Besides, even if the person intentionally sent it,
it&#8217;s unlikely that the person
actually <i>wrote</i> the program, and you probably aren&#8217;t going to
review its code... so neither of you have any idea what it really does.
And if you don&#8217;t know the person, this is even more true --
<b>never</b> run a program sent by a spammer!
They can make money by exploiting your system (say to send more spam,
selling data they find on your system, and so on).
<p>
If you want to send a program, don&#8217;t send the program itself --
send a URL to a web address.
That way, recipients can download it at their own time, and if the
maker updates it, recipients can get the update.
You shouldn&#8217;t just run arbitrary programs you download from
the web either, but we&#8217;ll get to that.

<p>
<a name="nostrangerattachments"></a>
<li>
<b>Don&#8217;t just open attachments from strangers.</b>
Don&#8217;t open attachments from people you don&#8217;t know, even if they
appear &#8220;safe&#8221;; they may exploit your system and cause
you to run programs in ways you weren&#8217;t expecting.
<p>
To get work done, you&#8217;ll need to open attachments.
Here, try to avoid opening attachments from strangers; at least,
look at the message body carefully before taking that risk.
<p>
You can reduce your risk greatly by only opening types of attachments
that are less risky.
To determine its type, just look at the last characters in the filename
(yes, it&#8217;s more complicated than that, but I can&#8217;t go into that here
and have a reasonable suggestion for ordinary users).
It&#8217;s hard to list what can be an executable,
since there are many different program formats
(.exe, .com, .bat, and so on), and some programs aren&#8217;t designed to
handle arbitrary data.
It&#8217;s a lot easier to say what&#8217;s safer.
A .txt file is generally safe to open (but don&#8217;t save and run it!).
A .htm or .html file is usually safe, as long as you don&#8217;t let
Internet Explorer look at it (IE may be fooled into thinking it&#8217;s a
&#8220;local&#8221; file, disabling its security; other browsers aren&#8217;t so
easily fooled).
Although office suite files (.doc, .ppt, .xls) <i>can</i> have
programs (macros) embedded in them, as long as your office suite doesn&#8217;t
run macros you&#8217;re usually fine.
PDF files (.pdf) are designed to be sent safely over the web, and have
fairly low risk.
Handling any data involves some risk, but these formats have a much lower risk.
<p>
Image formats (like .jpg, .png, and .gif) and audio formats
(like .mp3 and .ogg) are actually a slightly higher risk in my opinion.
Many image and audio formats are passed on to Windows code with a
history of failure to protect itself
(I suspect the developers had no idea that this was security-relevant, and
that they didn&#8217;t know how to write secure code anyway).
Still, if you know the person they are from, they are usually fine.
<p>
If you get an attachment, but do not know what its format is,
ask the sender first.
Then use search engines (like Google) to find out your risk.
Don&#8217;t be a victim.

<p>
<a name="nopiracy"></a>
<li>
<b>Don&#8217;t run &#8220;pirated&#8221; programs.</b>
Some people install and use programs copied illegally;
this is sometimes called &#8220;piracy&#8221;.
Don&#8217;t do this; it should be reason enough that it&#8217;s illegal.
However, there are also good security reasons.
You usually won&#8217;t get support or security patches for your illegally
copied software
(e.g.,
<a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/6868504/">Microsoft
will severely curtail the updates available to illegal copies of Windows</a>).
Some programs try to determine if they&#8217;re legal, and if they
think they&#8217;re not, they do malicious things.
And if you&#8217;ve downloaded the pirated programs from one of the many
&#8220;warez&#8221; sites, you have an additional problems: some such programs have
had malicious software (such as &#8220;Trojan Horses&#8221;) intentionally inserted
into them, and often such software is changed but poorly tested (so it&#8217;s
likely to have subtle problems that legitimate copies won&#8217;t have).
Yes, some software is expensive; doing the right thing
is often expensive.
<p>
Buy your programs, or use freely-available alternatives
that are legal to copy.
I particularly like widely-used open source software, since they
can get security reviews worldwide, and they are often free or low cost.
One of the more heavily pirated programs is Microsoft Office;
instead of copying it illegally, either buy it or use
<a href="http://www.openoffice.org/">OpenOffice.org</a> instead, which
is free and legal to copy
(here's a <a href="http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,1759,1571626,00.asp">review from 2004 of the two suites</a>).
<a href="http://theopendisc.com/">The OpenDisc project</a>
(formerly <a href="http://theopencd.sunsite.dk/index.php">OpenCD</a>)
has a nice collection of free open source software for Microsoft Windows
that fits on a single CD; it includes OpenOffice.org (office suite),
PDFCreator (to create PDF documents),
the GIMP (for editing images/photographs),
7-Zip (for creating and unpacking compressed files like the .zip format),
and Audacity (for sound editing), along with games and other things.
If you don't like to create CDs,
you can also buy OpenOffice plus Firefox by buying Linspire's
<a href="http://www.oooff.com">OOoFf!</a>
You can suport from various sources;
<a href="http://www.flexiety.com">Flexiety sells a boxed
version of OpenOffice.org with support</a>; they have deals with
various CompUSA stores, and it's also available at
<a href="http://www.tigerdirect.com">tigerdirect.com</a>

<p>
<a name="checkreputation"></a>
<li>
<b>Don&#8217;t download and run arbitrary programs before
checking out their reputation.</b>
A program that&#8217;s widely-advertized can still be spyware, but it&#8217;s
likely that someone on the Internet has noticed.
So use <a href="http://www.google.com">Google</a> and other search
services to see what the reputation of that program is.
Of course, someone can falsely accuse a program of being spyware,
and it may be that the problems are&#8217;t known,
but by searching you&#8217;re more likely to at least be warned of problems.
Run only a few programs,
and check out their reputation first before you do.
<p>
Free isn&#8217;t necessarily bad; indeed,
PCWorld found that the free anti-spyware
programs were better than the for-pay ones they evaluated.
<a href="http://www.cleansoftware.org/">Cleansoftware.org</a> has a
list of no-cost software widely believed to be free of
adware, spyware, harmful/intrusive components, and threats to privacy.
<p>
Some programs are &#8220;open source software&#8221;, meaning that anyone can
view its blueprints (the &#8220;source code&#8221;), modify it,
and redistribute those changes.
The Internet, Email, and World Wide Web have all been based on these
kinds of programs.
It&#8217;s certainly possible to create malicious open source software;
people have done it.
But since anyone can review its code, if it&#8217;s popular, it&#8217;s harder
to hide malicious code in it, and many of the financial reasons to create
malicious code disappear.
But don&#8217;t just run arbitrary open source software, either!
<p>
In the end -- be careful out there.
Run a minimum number of programs -- just those you really need -- and
check out their reputation first.

<p>
<a name="readlicense"></a>
<li>
<b>Ideally you should read any program license agreement ("EULA") before installing it -- but if you won't do that, at least check its reputation first (as noted above).</b>
First, let me give you the "official" advice you'll hear from most authorities,
because it's considered by many people to be the safest course.
Officially, you should carefully read any
end-user license agreements ("EULAs") of a program before you install it.
After all, many EULAs
say that you&#8217;ll allow the vendor to do all sorts of things
that are invasive, dangerous, and/or unexpected, and you should (in theory)
consider those issues before you install it.
Many spyware programs are apparantly legal because their license says that
they&#8217;re allowed to do all sorts of frightening things... and you
&#8220;agreed&#8221; to it.
<p>
Unfortunately, I must admit that
the advice of actually reading EULAs is hard to follow.
License agreements are notoriously hard to understand; they're often
intentionally written so that the most important parts are
the hardest to understand.
Even when the drafters try to be clear, legal documents are still hard for
many people to understand.
Many people have a large number of programs on their systems, and asking
them to read all that stuff is impractical, even when they're easy to read.
To many people, EULAs make no sense in the first place -- they
expect the conditions governing shrinkwrap programs they buy to be
just like those of a book or a car.
<!-- Too much detail: (e.g., they expect to be able to
use it without being spied on, to be able to sell it to someone else as
long as they don't keep a copy, and to be able to peruse it or modify
it locally as they see fit). -->
In most jurisdictions, typical EULA conditions
are on shaky legal ground, making it harder to justify wading through them.
At least one lawyer I know (and respect) recommends <i>not</i> reading
EULAs, since it&#8217;s usually harder for a company to enforce a license
if you did not read it.
<p>
And let's be honest --
<a href="http://www.pcpitstop.com/spycheck/eula.asp">almost no one actually
reads EULAs, as a PC Pitstop experiment showed.</a>
PC Pitstop included a clause in one of its own EULAs that
promised anyone who read it "special consideration", including money.
"After four months and more than 3,000 downloads, one person finally
wrote in. That person, by the way, got a check for $1,000..."
Think about that -- it took 3,000 downloads and four months before <i>one</i>
person read the EULA!
Clearly, it's very unusual for anyone to actually read a EULA.
<p>
This is unfortunate; from a security point of view
you should read the EULA, since it might warn you of security problems.
After all,
<a href="http://eff.org/wp/eula.php">many EULAs include dangerous clauses</a>.
<p>
If you won't read the whole EULA, try to at least read the first line,
because there's one case where reading that one line can substantially
lower your risk.
Basically, widely-used
<a href="https://dwheeler.com/oss_fs_why.html">open source software / Free Software</a>
licenses do <i>not</i> include
any text to permit spyware or other dangerous activities,
and the license text is the same for many different programs.
So at least try to read the first line of the EULA to see if the license is
the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html">GNU General Public License
(GPL)</a>, the
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/lesser.html">GNU
Lesser General Public License (LGPL)</a>, or the
<a href="http://www.opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.html">MIT license</a>.
If the EULA is one of those licenses, your risk is <i>much</i> lower.
(Some lawyers would say that these licenses are
technically not EULAs, but this is a technicality;
in practice they are sometimes displayed during installation just like a EULA.)
Unfortunately, every proprietary program generally has its own license,
so I can't point to a single widely-used safe EULA that covers many
proprietary programs.
Indeed, many EULAs of even common proprietary products are rather scary;
for example,
<a href="http://www.groklaw.net/article.php?story=20050106075631519">
the Windows XP End-User License Agreement (EULA)</a>
requires you to reveal private information to the vendor,
it allows the vendor to modify your computer&#8217;s software
at will, it states that the vendor may collect personal data about you
without warning or limitation,
and it states that the vendor can terminate the agreement at any time
without due process (leaving you without a working version of Windows).
And not all spyware programs will reveal what they do in their EULA, anyway.
<p>
So whether or not you read the EULA,
check the reputation of the company and the
product you're considering, as I recommended above.


<p>
<a name="phishing"></a>
<li><b>Be wary of phishing attacks; limit information you send, especially if you didn&#8217;t initiate the interaction.</b>
Many attacks, particularly from email, try to fool you into giving
away important information by pretending to be someone else.
Emails can be easily forged; don&#8217;t believe a &#8220;From&#8221; address at all,
since it&#8217;s trivial to set that to any value.
It&#8217;s easy to set up web sites that <i>look</i> legitimate, so
be careful about that too.
<p>
Don&#8217;t trust any email links that send you elsewhere,
because there are many ways to be deceptive
(www.paypa1.com is different than www.paypal.com because &#8220;one&#8221; looks like
an &#8220;l&#8221;; http://forbes.com@attacker.com will send you you attacker.com;
and many trusted sites can be fooled into resending attacker information
if you invoke them oddly).
Don&#8217;t give any personal information unless you initiated the
entire transaction.
Don&#8217;t provide unrequired information on any web site you visit;
required information is usually noted with an asterisk (*).

<p>
<a name="backups"></a>
<li>
<b>Make backups.</b>
Back up your data.
You should anyway; hard disks eventually crash.
That way, if someone erases all your data, you can quickly recover.
Thumb drives or second hard drives are good ways to back up;
CD-ROMs become a pain after a while, but do work.

<p>
<a name="disconnect"></a>
<li>
<b>Disconnect from the Internet when you&#8217;re not using it, and turn off the computer when you&#8217;re not using it.</b>
Unplugging is the simplest approach, if you have a wired network but
you still want to use the computer.
<p>
Obviously, it&#8217;s harder to attack a computer that&#8217;s turned off.
But it may surprise you to know that most of today&#8217;s computers can be
turned back on, remotely, using a network command!
Most systems don&#8217;t enable that by default, but yours may,
and there&#8217;s always the risk that a vendor has a security vulnerability
that lets someone turn it on even if you&#8217;ve disabled it.
The best solution is an external firewall, which you need anyway.
Firewalls will generally prevent such remote turn-on commands from
entering your network in the first place.

<p>
<a name="kidsnoreveal"></a>
<li><b>Tell your younger kids to <i>never</i> reveal their real name,
address, email, or phone number without your permission.</b>
Reputable kids&#8217; sites won&#8217;t even ask for this information.
Zip code is okay; indeed, a site can probably guess one of a small
set of zip codes from your IP address.
You should be able to judge as they get older what&#8217;s okay.
The risk here is stalkers, who try to exploit chat systems and the
like to gain their trust.
Unfortunately, getting older doesn&#8217;t necessarily make your child safer
against predators.

<p>
<a name="whitelistemail"></a>
<li><b>If you let your kids have email, configure it so only whitelisted
addresses will be received.</b>
I don&#8217;t recommend that young kids have email access; if they need to
send an email, do it through a parent.
But older kids will typically <i>need</i> email access.
The problem is that spammers will eventually get that email address,
or guess it, and soon your kid will be getting hardcore porn,
hate group advocacy propaganda, and so on.
So, configure your kids&#8217; accounts so only email from an
approved &#8220;whitelist&#8221; list of senders can get through, and throw
away the rest.


<p>
<a name="harden"></a>
<li>
<b>Change your configuration so it&#8217;s harder to attack.</b>
You&#8217;ll be better off if you change the default settings into something
that&#8217;s more secure (this is called <i>hardening</i> your system).
In particular, if you use an old version of Microsoft Office,
make sure it doesn&#8217;t run macros by default.
Very old versions of office had this flaw; more
recent versions of office have fixed this.
<p>
<a href="http://www.nsa.gov/snac/">The NSA Security Configuration Guides</a>
give a lot of information on how to configure some Windows versions;
yes, you&#8217;re not the Department of Defense, but wouldn&#8217;t
you like your system to have security more like theirs?
Another good source for how to configure systems securely is
<a href="http://csrc.nist.gov/pcig/cig.html">
U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)
checklists/information guides</a>, some of which were developed by others
and then adopted by NIST.
Look specifically at the Desktop Application STIG and checklist,
and the various Windows STIGs and checklists.
<p>
If you use Windows 2003, take a look at Microsoft&#8217;s configuration guide
for Windows 2003.
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/security/">
Microsoft&#8217;s Security Home Page</a> has other useful tips
on securing Windows systems (though they often focus on the latest
versions of their products, even though you may find no reason
to upgrade).
Other documents such as
<!--
<a href="http://netsecurity.about.com/cs/windowsxp/a/aa042204.htm">
Securing Windows XP Home Edition
-->
<a href="http://netsecurity.about.com/cs/windowsxp/a/aa100903.htm">
Microsoft Windows Security 101</a>
have useful information too.
You don&#8217;t need to accept every suggestion, but information like this
can help you secure your system.
Unfortunately, this can be time-consuming; sorry about that.


<p>
<a name="wireless"></a>
<li><b>Configure your wireless setup to be secure, too.</b>
Many Windows users have a wireless setup, typically 802.11b
(though 802.11g, 802.11a, and others are out there too).
If you do, configure it securely too.
You must plan on spending some time to configure your wireless devices
to be secure; they&#8217;ll come with all security disabled.
<p>
Some people like to share their wireless access with the world.
Feel free to do so (if your ISP allows it), but at that point you
need to treat wireless users as potential attackers.
Be sure to segregate your
open wireless setup from your &#8220;internal&#8221; machines, at least
by placing a firewall between the wireless and wired network.
But I feel more comfortable making it hard for anyone else to connect in,
and for new wireless users I suggest that as well.
<p>
I&#8217;ll concentrate on the basics of securing
802.11 based wireless connections, since they&#8217;re the most common.
Here, you need to configure your wireless hub (access point) and computers
so that their wireless connection is more secure.
Use the new 802.11i security standard if you can (but few can),
otherwise use WPA if you can (though relatively few can),
otherwise <i>at least</i> turn on WEP.
Unfortunately,
WEP is very vulnerable to attackers; for more information, see
<a href="http://securityfocus.com/infocus/1814">WEP: Dead Again</a>.
Indeed, the <a href="http://www.tomsnetworking.com/Sections-article111.php">
FBI demonstrated that a determined attacker can usually break 128-bit WEP
(the strongest form of WEP) in 5-10 minutes.</a>
On the other hand, WEP is better than than nothing at all (it stops
casual attackers, who often move on to an easier target).
Set your WEP/WPA key to a nice long unguessable
128-bit key (aka 104-bit); don&#8217;t use a default key, and change the
key every once in a while.
And if your WEP-only components can be freely upgraded to WPA
(e.g., through a "firmware upgrade"), please do so.
<p>
Disable broadcasting of your Server Set ID (SSID); that way, when
no one is using your wireless connection an attacker is less likely to
find your equipment.
Turn on the configuration setup of your base station, and (re)set every
password you can to something only you would know
(this would include a configuration password, SNMP password, and so on).
Point your base station antenna(s) so that the signals are much weaker
where you don&#8217;t plan to use it (an attacker can amplify the signal
to potentially miles, but many don&#8217;t).
Some folks recommend using media access control (MAC)
address restrictions; I don&#8217;t particularly recommend
this, because this significantly adds complications
without any significant security benefits
(attackers can easily work around it), but it won&#8217;t <i>hurt</i>
if you do.
<P>
Ideally, you should segregate your wireless network from your internal
wired network, even if you use other mechanisms like WEP, WPA, or 802.11i.
This is <i>especially</i> a good idea for WEP users.
For many home users this may be excessive, but for small businesses
adding an extra firewall between the wired and wireless networks is a cheap
measure that improves their security.

<p>
<a name="physical"></a>
<li>
<b>Don&#8217;t forget physical security.</b>
In any situation, make sure it&#8217;s not easy to steal your equipment,
or allow an attacker to modify it.
Home users: remember to lock the door on the way out!
In a business, make sure that only a few people can physically access the
the equipment, especially the firewall (a locked closet works well).
To secure a laptop, consider locking it in a safe when you&#8217;re
not using it, or using a cable and lock;
treat it like a wallet.

You might also find
<a href="http://www.cert.org/tech_tips/home_networks.html">
CERT/CC&#8217;s Home Network Security</a> document very helpful;
it also describes the kinds of attacks that homes and small businesses
must endure, and how to help defend your system.  CERT&#8217;s document is
slightly older, though; for example, when I reviewed it on December 7, 2004,
it didn&#8217;t cover spyware or alternative programs.
<a href="http://www.us-cert.gov/cas/tips">The US-CERT has some

Howard Fosdick's
"How to Secure Your Windows Computer and Protect Your Privacy
- with Free Software: An Easy Guide for the Windows User"</a> has
lots of good information; I learned about it after writing this.

<p>
Unlike some guidance documents (say from CERT), since this is
a personal essay I can give you the <i>real</i> story on how to
secure your system, including naming names.
For example, many organizations avoid saying that you
should replace a program with a bad security record for
one with a good record -- and
they certainly don&#8217;t give you specific alternatives!
<!--
Seems too strong:
"for example,
<a href="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/microsoft/2002124782_ie20.html">
Marty Lindner of the US CERT refuses
to recommend a particular browser, or even say what
he's using personally</a>"
-->
I understand their restrictions; they don't want to appear to
recommend any particular product.
However, since this is a personal article,
I can suggest applications you should replace to secure your system.
Many attacks exploit Internet Explorer and Outlook, so just replacing
those programs eliminates many problems.
Many lists also fail to warn you about the problems of certain updates,
in particular, many people have had problems with XP Service Pack 2 (SP2).
Instead of avoiding the issue, I recommend that you try to apply SP2, but
I also warn you that you need back up everything first
so that you can reload your system (if necessary).
I don&#8217;t give keystroke-by-keystroke help, but this checklist should
be enough to get you started (so you&#8217;ll know what to look for).
Hopefully you&#8217;ll still find this list useful.
<!--

<p>
<h1><a name="conclusions">Conclusions</a></h1>
<p>
This is not a complete list;
there are many other steps you can take.
Think of this as a starting point, if you haven&#8217;t done anything before.
Basically, create a set of layered defenses (like firewalls),
don&#8217;t add arbitrary programs,
replace programs that have a bad security track record
(like IE and Outlook), and keep up with patches.

<p>
By the way, I say the same thing about other programs that
have poor track records.
You&#8217;re more likely to be secure if you switch to a product
with a significantly better security track record.
What a surprise.
For example,
if you have an infrastructure for sending email, I would heartily recommend
replacing Sendmail (a common component with a terrible security record)
with Postfix or some other common alternative with
an excellent security record.
(There&#8217;s a new Sendmail 10 coming up, which basically tries to
reimplement the same approach Postfix uses for security.)
Past performance is no guarantee of future results -- but
it&#8217;s one of the best predictors we have.

<p>
If you&#8217;re part of a larger organization, in particular, one
with your own IT personnel, you need to do more.
In fact, you should already have implemented far more.
If that describes you, you should be talking about meeting standards
like ISO 17799 (or more specific standards for your circumstance),
and doing things like devising security policies
(including incident response and disaster recovery),
doing more formal threat analysis and vulnerability testing,
performing active filtering and monitoring of your network
(including intrusion detection and scanning for unauthorized
modems/wireless nodes), and so on.
If you&#8217;re actually a direct target (e.g., you&#8217;re concerned about
economic espionage or a foreign government targeting you), you&#8217;ll need to
go far, far beyond these steps.
Still, these steps might be a useful starting point.

<p>
<a name="alternativeos"></a>
Of course, a completely different option is to switch from
Microsoft Windows to a different system that has a better
security track record.
It&#8217;s not that you <i>can&#8217;t</i> run Windows relatively securely;
I believe that with effort and careful control of your environment
(such as by using external firewalls)
you can use Microsoft Windows relatively securely.
In fact I do use Windows systems myself.
But to run Windows securely,
you have to think like a full-time system administrator,
and stay on top of things with extreme diligence;
even a security expert can tire of this.
When connecting to the Internet, at home I&#8217;ve switched to running
Linux instead,
from which I do all the typical things people do with computers
(such as surf the web, send/receive email, and send/receive
common data formats including pdf, doc, ppt, and xls).
As a result, I don&#8217;t have these kinds of security problems.
I'm not alone; in 2008
<a href="http://www.informationweek.com/news/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=205604334&amp;cid=nl_IWK_BTL">
InformationWeek noted that Linux-based systems have become far more
popular and easier to get - Wal-mart couldn't keep them in stock due
to high demand.</a>
I still end up helping others who need to secure their Windows
systems, though, which is why I wrote this article.
Microsoft correctly notes that other products have occasional security 
vulnerabilities, but that&#8217;s misleading;
I want a <i>good</i> track record compared to the competition, considering
both the number and severity of the vulnerabilities.
Alternative products like
<a href="http://fedora.redhat.com/">Fedora</a> (the one I use),
<a href="http://www.redhat.com/">Red Hat Enterprise</a>,
<a href="http://www.ubuntulinux.org/">Ubuntu</a>,
and
<a href="http://www.novell.com/linux/suse/">Novell SuSE</a>,
<!-- Financial problems suggest I should remove this:
<a href="http://www.mandrakesoft.com/">Mandriva (formerly MandrakeSoft)</a>,
-->
have much to recommend to first-time users.
Fedora even includes buffer overflow protection for
all programs and mandatory access controls, both of which
help prevent problems in the first place.
Experienced people might be happy with products such as
<a href="http://www.freebsd.org/">FreeBSD</a>,
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/">OpenBSD</a>,
or
<a href="http://www.debian.org/">Debian</a>.
<a href="http://distrowatch.com/dwres.php?resource=major">DistroWatch
has a summary of the top ten open source distributions</a>.
Mac OS X is also relatively strong from a security point-of-view,
though that&#8217;s not based on general-purpose PC hardware
(so you&#8217;ll have to buy new hardware to switch).
(Mac OS does not include measures like buffer overflow protections using
N+X and randomization, nor does it embed mandatory access controls,
so in my opinion Fedora and Red Hat Linux have stronger security than Mac OS -
but it's not bad.)
But many people aren&#8217;t willing to switch from whatever they use,
no matter what the product does or doesn&#8217;t do.
Which is too bad;
if enough customers will say &#8220;we&#8217;ll stop buying your products
because they&#8217;re less secure than the competition&#8221;,
then market forces would have forced all vendors to have secure
products many years ago.
I have hopes that the market is just starting to make this happen.
<p>
In general, you need to create layers of defense, and/or
switch to more secure programs, if you want to keep your
computer safe.  And complain to Microsoft if you find this
unacceptable; they&#8217;re already starting to change some
things, thankfully.
Microsoft Windows XP Service Pack 2 in particular is a significant improvement
(although it still features the monolithic design, and insecure technologies
like ActiveX, that are the root cause of many security problems).
But the more the outcry, the faster Microsoft will work to fix this.
They&#8217;ve sold products, and later decided to try to secure them,
with very predictable results.  All products have defects,
but the number of serious security defects in their products is
shamefully large.
It&#8217;s not just market share; Apache has twice the market share that
Microsoft&#8217;s IIS product has, and yet IIS has more
security vulnerabilities.
It&#8217;s a mindset.  One that I hope Microsoft is actively trying to
change.  Let&#8217;s help encourage them to change it... and in the meantime,
if you choose to use their products, follow steps like these to
reduce your risks.
