In general, make the input language as "nice" as you can, while staying
within limits of prover algorithm.



Build in equality (x=x.).  Crazy not to.
(Otter didn't.  prover9, thankfully, does).

Traditional Infix notation. Infix +,-,*,/, comparisons,
with standard precedence.  Prefix - (negate) at least.
(prover9 builds in +, *, etc., but has the wrong precedence.)

if-then-else, returning a term.  ite().

if-then-else, all boolean. if().
(originally I had the roles of ite/if reversed, but the SMT-LIB spec
does it this way, and I thought it'd be best to be consistent with that).

exists exactly 1 (exists! or exists1).

exists between X and Y...

NOTICE when constant integers equal/not equal.
Required by TPTP syntax version 3:
http://www.cs.miami.edu/~tptp/TPTP/SyntaxBNF.html
Easy; just require that
any term beginning with a digit MUST be a number.
For integers, just say what starts with a 0 MUST be 0, and 1-9
begin a sequence of 1+ digits.  If all base 10, can simply examine first
character of term to see if a constant integer, and compare as two
strings to see if equal.
(Doesn't support bases, decimals, fractions, etc.; could add but more
complex.)
MUST be in engine!

Add: notice when pair of constant non-fraction
integers relate in expected binary-operation ways, and replace with
calculated constant.
So: 1+1 is 2.
Use +,-,*,&lt;, &lt;=, &gt;, &gt;=.
(= and != covered above).
Bonus points: inc. negative numbers, division.
(Note: Can add axioms for relations when necessary,
like "for all x, x+1 &gt; x", but you can't really add handling these
functions that way in the general case.)
