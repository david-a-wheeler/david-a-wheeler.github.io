<i>
The Federal Trade Commission (FTC)
and National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)
are considering their options for email authentication as
a technique to partially counter spam.
I recommend that they make two fundamental decisions.
First, FTC and NIST should urge lawmakers to make spam illegal,
so that technological measures will have legal standing.
Authentication has little anti-spam value without it.
Second, FTC and NIST should insist that any anti-spam technical standard
must be implementable by all suppliers of email
infrastructure, both proprietary and open source software.
This essay responded to a Federal Register request supporting the
<a href="http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/workshops/e-authentication/">
&#8220;Email Authentication Summit&#8221; of November 9-10, 2004</a>.
Although it was
<a href="http://www.ftc.gov/os/comments/emailauthentication/index.htm">
publicly posted</a>,
and quoted in places such as
<a href="http://www.groklaw.net/article.php?story=20041109031629840&query=FTC+Wheeler">Groklaw&#8217;s FTC Email Authentication Summit article</a>,
it had various formatting problems, a few minor grammatical
mistakes, and it mentioned only NIST and not the FTC.
This version is much easier to read since it has been converted to HTML
and had these minor problems fixed.

<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>
Here are my comments on email authentication per
your request in the Federal Register, Sep. 15, 2004.
<p>
My response is lengthy, but the fundamental issues
are simple:
<ul>
<li>[FTC and] NIST should urge lawmakers to make spam illegal,
   so that technological measures will have legal standing.
   Authentication has little anti-spam value without it.
<li>[FTC and] NIST should insist that any anti-spam technical standard
   must be implementable by all suppliers of email
   infrastructure, both proprietary and open source software.
</ul>
<p>
Thank you.
Here are the details:

<h1>Spam Must be Made Illegal</h1>
<p>
In question 1, you ask: <i>&#8220;Whether any of the proposed authentication standards
(either alone or in conjunction with other existing technologies) would result
in a significant decrease in the amount of spam received by consumers;&#8221;</i>

By themselves, none of these authentication standards will
result in a significant decrease in the amount of spam, and
limiting solutions solely to technological measures will not
help either.
<p>
The fundamental problem is that our laws are
antiquated and have not yet caught up to Internet technology.
Fundamentally spam is theft, but one that the laws permit.
Spam steals 8 or more hours a month of my time; why am
I not paid for this theft of my time?  Spam steals vast amounts
of computing resources; many organizations have to buy
larger hard drives and network connections solely because
of spam.

There&#8217;s no point in worrying about authentication as long
as this theft is [legal].  So what if it&#8217;s authenticated -- it&#8217;s
authenticated theft.  As long as there is no legal way to
respond to the theft, authentication has no [anti-spam] value.
<p>
Businesses must be able to accept emails from
strangers; it&#8217;s how they get new business.
Home users must usually accept emails from
long-lost people they knew from years ago.
It&#8217;s not practical to only accept email from previously
known email addresses.  Thus, a spammer can
create a new address for every message, each of
which can be authenticated. And as noted in the Register,
spammers now take over user&#8217;s machines, and thus
they can send email as that user (and could
authenicate themselves, too).
<p>
This doesn&#8217;t mean that authentication is useless.
Authentication is useful in its own right, especially
for countering phishing attacks, and for eliminating
false &#8220;bounce&#8221; messages from forged email.
And authentication, when combined with other
anti-spam technology, could have a very slight
impact on spam in the short term.  But unless
there are laws forbidding spam, that permit
civil suits and recovery of damages
against spammers, then the
technological measures will not be very effective [at eliminating spam].
<p>
Once there are real anti-spam laws
(instead of the current &#8220;you CAN-SPAM
anytime you want to&#8221; U.S. [federal] laws), then authentication
will be very useful, because it will help to track
down lawbreakers.  But as long as theft is
legal, there&#8217;s no reason to authenticate people
who might not be breaking the law.
[The current U.S. federal laws do not make spamming itself illegal,
and impose requirements that do not solve the problem.]
<p>
Laws are quite possible. The U.S. already forbids
fax spam, and that law was passed for all the same
reasons that email spam should be illegal.
Europe has passed &#8220;opt-in&#8221; laws
(instead of the worthless &#8220;opt-out&#8221; laws).
Once most countries pass such laws,
people can decide to simply refuse to accept
email from other countries that don&#8217;t have or
don&#8217;t enforce such laws.
<p>
The current laws are [not appropriate].  It has been
clearly declared, for many years (and including
IETF RFCs) that users should <i>NEVER</i> respond to
so-called &#8220;opt-out&#8221; messages, since this clearly
marks the respondant as a &#8220;real email address&#8221;
that spammers will target even harder.
<p>
Don&#8217;t believe the nonsense about it being
impossible to define spam.  Other laws have had
definitional issues, and they&#8217;ve been created anyway.
A simple rule would be sending essentially the
same logical message to more than 1000 people without
their prior consent (e.g., by signing up for an email message).

This group must recommend that laws be
passed to forbid spam, and require <i>OPT-IN</i>
(not <i>OPT-OUT</i>) to large lists.
Then the technological measures
will have a chance at being effective, since they can
then help enforce laws instead of social conventions.

<h1>Standards Must be Implementable By All</h1>
<p>
Question 3 asks about compatibility with existing software;
questions 7-9  and 29 ask about control of the specification.
All of these questions indirectly with a serious problem
that you have no doubt already heard: namely, that
one of the major proposals (Microsoft&#8217;s [Sender-ID]) has been
cleverly designed to create market incompatibilities.
<p>
Microsoft is encumbering its proposal with what it
calls its &#8220;Royalty Free Sender ID Patent License.&#8221;
Novices might see no problems with this, but
this is simply not a reasonable proposal.
As the careful analysis of Mark Shewmaker
(<a href="http://www.imc.org/ietf-mxcomp/mail-archive/msg03514.html">
(http://www.imc.org/ietf-mxcomp/mail-archive/msg03514.html</a>)
and others shows, this license is extremely
discriminatory: it is essentially incompatible with
open source software (OSS).
<p>
Since [a] vast amount of the mail
infrastructure is implemented with OSS,
this is unreasonable and extremely discriminatory.
For example, the Apache Software Foundation (ASF)
announced that it couldn&#8217;t support Sender-ID, at:
<a href="http://www.apache.org/foundation/docs/sender-id-position.html">
http://www.apache.org/foundation/docs/sender-id-position.html</a>.
This is important since ASF releases the widely-used
<a href="http://spamassassin.apache.org/">
SpamAssassin</a> (as well as the Apache web server).
<p>
Any authentication system <i>MUST</i> be implementable
by all major systems.  This means that it must
be implementable by all open-source and
proprietary systems.  Mere public specification
is not enough; systems must be <i>IMPLEMENTABLE</i>
to be useful, and that includes terms that
permit widespread implementation by all
relevant parties.
<p>
Thus, as a private citizen I urge [FTC and] NIST to
clearly articulate that any anti-spam or authentication
standard must be clearly implementable by all
implementations, both proprietary and open source software,
or they should not be made standards.
If [FTC and] NIST makes this clear this would be a
useful result for question #29.
<p>
There are, no doubt, other important issues.
But I hope that you find these comments useful.
I wish you well in your deliberations.
<p>

<h1>Other Information</h1>
<p>
(Note that this information was not in my comments to FTC and NIST.)
<p>
Since this essay was written, it appears that SPF and Yahoo's DomainKeys are
gaining traction; both are implementable by anyone (OSS and proprietary).
Sadly, laws to stop spam theft are still not getting passed.
Until that happens, technological measures are doomed, since a spammer
can just keep finding workarounds for any technological solution to spam.
Someday there will be anti-spam laws so that anti-spam technology will
have a chance.
But that day is not today;
tomorrow isn&#8217;t looking good either.
