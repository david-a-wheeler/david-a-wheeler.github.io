This paper will explain why software patents are a problem,
how they affect you, and what you can do about them.

<p>
Once there were only a few computers in the world,
each limited to a few specific tasks
{Fancy "O" for "Once"; image of big cube computer with tiny people}

<p>
No longer.  Computer are everywhere.
{Center text with examples of computers. Have people interact with them.
Cell phones, microwaves, spreadsheets, web browser connecting to servers...}

<p>
After all there are many machines that aid our muscles,
but only computers aid our minds.
{Use an image of a brain as the panel itself, with the text inside}

<p>
Yet computers are just paperweights without the instructions
that tell them what to do... what we call software.
{Trivial Flowchart, with a decision box and Yes/No flowing out.
Should "if" be "At risk from software patents?"}

<p>
U.S. courts have radically re-interpreted laws to allow
patents on software.
Patents are government-created monopolies on ideas,
and originally were explicitly forbidden for software.
{Cartoon "me" says this, Face plus tie. Image of a judge with gavel.}

<p>
This paper will explain why software patents are a problem,
how they affect you, and what you can do about them.

<p>
Why are software patents a problem?
The problem is that software is fundamentally unlike any physical device;
they are <i>all about</i> ideas.

<p>
Most phyical devices are made from relatively few parts.
Only a few ideas define it, and thus only a few patents can possibly apply.
{Image of razor, with points to handle, bladeholder, blade.}

<p>
In the physical world, new (practical) ideas are hard to come by,
because the physical world imposes many limitations on what can be done.


<p>
But a typical program might have a million text lines of code, with every
2-3 lines embodying an idea. Every combination of ideas might embody
another idea... so a typical program might contain <i>millions</i> of
ideas.

<p>
A program is really nothing more than a collection of ideas!
New ideas are easily come by, and combining and recombining them is easy.

<p>
???
Figuring what's a "new" idea is very hard.. every program is different,
and thus does something different.
The solution of the U.S. PTO is to grant a vast number of software patents.
The result is a "patent thicket".

<p>
??? Rest:
You make software if make spreadsheet, macros, HTML (!); as computers
become more common, you'll want to control them (ONLY aid to mind)...
if you can't, someone else will
(similarity to mind control!).
FFII Webstore.
Trolls, monsters. {More and more monsters growing in the field!}
Cross license, patent farm, not enough (RIM, swings).
Developers don't want them.
PTO Lawyers want them, but conflict of interest (and one not often recognized).
Patent offices exist to server patent-requesters, NOT innovators or creators -
different people in the software world.
(Study showing more patents, less innovation).
Probable results: few large companies, little innovation,
no local solutions / server flight
from patent-granting countries (such as U.S.).
Unjustified - HAVE a solution for protecting software developers,
it's called copyright.
Copyright worked for decades, no need for software patents.
EU stopped for now (note funny politics, such as fishing meeting).
What can you do...

<a href="innovation/innovation.html#patents">
There is a vast amount of evidence that software patents
harm software developers and software users</a>.
For example,
<a href="http://www.researchoninnovation.org/patent.pdf">
Bessen and Maskin demonstrated that as U.S. software patentability went up,
software innovation went down (in contrast with the rest of industry)</a>.
If software patents were permitted,
<a href="http://webshop.ffii.org/">typical webstores would become illegal</a>.
When the
<a href="http://www.ffii.org.uk/ftc/ftc.html">U.S. Federal Trade Commission
examined software patents</a>, they found that
"Many panelists and participants expressed the view that
software and Internet patents are impeding innovation.
They stated that such patents are impairing follow-on incentives,
increasing entry barriers, creating uncertainty that harms incentives
to invest in innovation, and producing patent thickets."
<a href="http://www.patent.gov.uk/about/consultations/annexc.htm">
UK proposal respondants overwhelmingly disapproved of software patents.</a>
Software development has proceeded quite well without
the imposition of patents, so there's no problem that needs "fixing".
<p>
Because patents harm software development and impede innovation, a <a
href="http://www3.europarl.eu.int/omk/omnsapir.so/pv2?PRG=CALDOC&amp;FILE=20030924&amp;LANGUE=EN&amp;TPV=DEF&amp;LASTCHAP=31&amp;SDOCTA=2&amp;TXTLST=2&amp;Type_Doc=ANNEX&amp;POS=1">democratically voted decision</a> of the European
Parliament on September 24, 2003 determined to not allow
unlimited software patenting.
This has the support of more than <a
href="http://petition.eurolinux.org">300,000 citizens</a>,
and dozens of professional <a
href="http://www.researchineurope.org/policy/patentdirltr.htm">economists</a>
and <a
href="http://swpat.ffii.org/papers/eubsa-swpat0202/komp0305/index.en.html">scientists</a>.
<p>
Nevertheless,
the European <a
href="http://swpat.ffii.org/players/bolkestein/index.en.html">Commission</a>
and the <a
href="http://swpat.ffii.org/papers/europarl0309/cons0401/index.en.html">Council
of Ministers</a> are overrode the EU parliament
to permit essentially unlimited patentability of software,
thanks to heavy lobbying by patent lawyers.
Then, through a series of possibly illegal actions, they've created
a situation where a mere majority isn't enough to reach a
reasonable result.
If they succeed,
this extreme policy will inhibit innovation and competition, and
cause great harm to both software developers and software users.
</p>
<a href="http://nosoftwarepatents.com/en/m/intro/app0411.html">
Linus Torvalds, Michael Widenius and Rasmus Lerdorf
have written an appeal to the EU Council against
software patents in Europe.</a>
Their letter reveals:
"The draft directive in question is deceptive because it leads laymen, and even
those legal professionals who are not familiar with the intricacies of patent
law, to falsely believe that it would exclude software from patentability.
However, it is actually a compilation of the entirety of the excuses with
which the patent system has, for many years, been circumventing article 52 of
the European Patent Convention in order to grant patents on software ideas."

for more information on the problem, and how you can stop it.
Please do what you can to stop this unwise idea from becoming law.
