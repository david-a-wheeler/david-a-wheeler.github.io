Using Static Analysis And Clang To Find Heartbleed
April 27, 2014 by Andrew Ruef 7 Comments
Background

Implemented a static checker to find heartbleed,

"One approach to identify Heartbleed statically was proposed by Coverity recently, which is to taint the return values of calls to ntohl and ntohs as input data. One problem with doing static analysis on a big state machine like OpenSSL is that your analysis either has to know the state machine to be able to track what values are attacker influenced across the whole program, or, they have to have some kind of annotation in the program that tells the analysis where there is a use of input data.  
I like this observation because it is pretty actionable. You mark ntohl calls as producing tainted data, which is a heuristic, but a pretty good one because programmers probably wonâ€™t htonl their own data."
