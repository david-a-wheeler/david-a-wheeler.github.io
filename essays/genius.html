<h1 class="title">How to be a Genius</h1>
<h2 class="author">David A. Wheeler</h2>
<h2 class="date">2016-01-16</h2>

Be curious
History of Rome, etc.

Ramp up your reading/ listening/ watching speed

Be a specialist and a generalist

Learn from little projects

Anticipate.

Work across ages.
Some areas are youth-obsessed;
they (incorrectly) assume you can't learn from the past.
Other areas are older-person-obsessed;
they (incorrectly) assume that younger people have no wisdom to provide.
Neither are right.

Build systems in ways to avoid or detect mistakes.
Everyone makes mistakes.
Pick designs that are less mistake-prone, or at least make it easy to
find the problem if you make a mistake.
I'm good at multitasking, and when possible, I avoid it (easy to make
a mistake, hard to debug).
Use tools to detect mistakes ahead of time.
