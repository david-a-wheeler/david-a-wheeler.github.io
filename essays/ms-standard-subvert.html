<h1 class="title">MS Subverting Standards?</h1>
<h2 class="author">David A. Wheeler</h2>

<h1>Introduction</h1>

I'm glad when Microsoft works hard to improve their products.
But lately, Microsoft seems to be working harder at
manipulating standards to prevent competition.
Isn't that illegal?
<p>
Let's look at the standards that Microsoft is trying to manipulate:

<ol>
<li>
Sender-ID, an anti-email-fraud technique.
Microsoft patented their own technique, giving it a "free" licence that
just happened to be essentially unusable by open source software
(their primary competitor).

(Microsoft's portion is called "Caller ID").

<a href="http://apache.org/foundation/docs/sender-id-position.html">
Apache</a>, Debian, IETF, Free Software Foundation analysis.
<a href="http://www.moongroup.com/index.php?option=content&amp;task=view&amp;id=25&amp;Itemid=2">IETF roundly reject this</a>
AOL rejected.

has detailed analysis of patent license vs. various freedom tests
(including 'dissident' test, 'tentacles of evil' test, etc.)

<li>
Copy protection.
As noted elsewhere,

copy protection is wonderful for locking in customers.

(RIAA move???)

<li>
USB.

How Microsoft Plans to Use a New USB Standard to Cripple Linux

By Robert X. Cringely

Microsoft essentially controls the PC hardware standards,
and exploiting this by developing a new USB standard that
specifically excludes Linux and probably OS X devices as well.
