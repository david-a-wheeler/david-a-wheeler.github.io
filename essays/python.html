Python is a widely-used scripting language that has a lot of built-in
functionality.  Programs written in it will tend to not be as fast as C
or C++, but they can be quickly written, making it useful for some kinds
of analysis.  There is a &quot;Python 2&quot; series and a &quot;Python
3&quot; series; Python 3 is newer, but as of this writing, most libraries
continue to use Python 2.

You can use Python to quickly read a CSV file and then process it.  Here's a template if Excel generated the CSV file:
<pre>
  #!/usr/bin/env python
  import csv
  myReader = csv.reader(open('eggs.csv', 'rb'), dialect='excel')
  # If you want to read in headers as its own line, do this:
  #   headers = myReader.next()
  # You can then refer to columns position indexes by name as headers.index('COLUMN_NAME')
  for row in myReader:
    # Process it here, e.g., row[0] is the first (0th) column value.
</pre>
</p>

<p>
You can also use the &quot;CSV&quot; library to write csv files.  Here's an example, where files are read in a line at a time, split on whitespace, and written as CSV; you can give the filenames on the command line, or redirect standard input:
<pre>
  #!/usr/bin/env python
  import csv,fileinput,sys
  myWriter = csv.writer(sys.stdout, dialect='excel')
  # To write out headers:
  # myWriter.writerow(['Heading1', 'Heading2'])
  for line in fileinput.input():
    myWriter.writerow(line.split())
</pre>
