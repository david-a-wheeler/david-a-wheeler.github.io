<h1 class="title">POSSCON 2011 Travelogue</h1>
<h2 class="author">David A. Wheeler</h2>
<h2 class="date">2011-03-28</h2>

<p>
I went to the
Palmetto Open Source Software Conference (POSSCON)
in Columbia, SC, on March 23-24, 2011.
Here's a summary of some of what I saw and learned,
in case you're curious.
<p>
<h2>Arrival</h2>
<p>
I arrived the night before and
was picked up at the airport by the conference organizers (thanks!).
We speakers were then treated
to a nice dinner at Ruth's Chris Steak House.
I appreciated the warm welcome.
<p>
At my table were Joe 'Zonker' Brockmeier,
David Riley, Vanessa Manchester, Todd Lewis,
Steven Benjamin, the mayor of the city of Columbia.
Zonker and I talked some about FLOSS licenses; I'm
sure we'll continue that conversation later :-).
Talking with the mayor was especially interesting; I don't
usually have a chance to talk with a city mayor.
It became clear that POSSCON was not <i>just</i> for technical people.
The mayor was very interested in getting jobs into his city.
All by itself a large conference (with speakers that people will come
to see) can help a city, but he was especially interested
in getting local work going by bringing information technology (IT)
businesses into the area, includings ones that use or develop OSS.
Frankly, this makes sense.
Years ago I saw Brazil working to create IT jobs, including
through the use and development of FLOSS;
it makes just as much sense in the US.
<p>
Afterwards I got to see their "IToLogy" site, which is a facility
set up to help information technology in the city.
It included a 200-person room for giving presentations,
a room with lots of platforms for developing software
(with Windows, Mac, Linux, and even a one laptop per child system),
and so on.
They'll soon have a 3D printer there, too (more on that in a moment).
<p>
The facilities were nice and all, but my immediate thought was
"what about the people"?
Software (including FLOSS)
development can be aided with facilities, but they're
mostly optional, and are way less important than the people.
The possibly-good news is that Columbia has several universities;
the University of South Carolina has about 30,000 people and is located
there, and there are several other colleges and universities
that are in it or nearby.
The big question is whether or not they can use that fact to
grow a stronger IT community.
Can they?
We'll see, but the fact that they're actively
trying to grow their IT capability is a good sign.

<p>
<h2>Open Source 3D Printers... especially the RepRap</h2>
<p>
The conference had a number of booths; one booth I visited
repeatedly was the 3D open source printer booth run by
Neil Underwood and Jim McCracken.
I also went to Jim McCracken's presentation on 3D printers.
<p>
Open source 3D printers are <b><i>important</i></b>.
These things have the potential to change life as we know it.
<p>
The basic idea is really simple.
A typical printer of today can print any image on paper.
Similarly, a 3D printer can print <i>physical objects</i>.
Just download a file describing the object, and print it on a 3D printer.
If you can't find a file you like, maybe you can tweak one or design your own.
3D printers have been around a long time, but historically
they cost $20,000 or more, so their use has been restricted to
specialized shops.
<p>
In contrast, the new open source 3D printers are now inexpensive enough that
you could have one at home.
All the details of how to build one are available to the public, and
since anyone can make improvements, people around the world are constantly
refining them (including by reducing their costs).
If you're willing to put in the time to get parts
and build it from scratch, you can build a RepRap for less than $400.
You can get kits that cost about $850.
Even more interestingly, a RepRap can build many of its own parts,
so once one person has one, he can create other RepRaps for his friends.
Neil Underwood joked that it was the "world's worst business model".
<p>
This is a potential game-changer for the world economy.
For components that can be made this way it
eliminates scarcity; that in turn makes some kinds of physical devices
look more like software.
<p>
Obviously, there are limits to this.
There are two major kinds of 3D printers: Additive (where you keep adding
materials) and subtractive (where you sculpt out the material from a solid
block).
Subtractive 3D printers waste a lot of material, so additive printers
tend to make things more cheaply; the RepRap is additive.
The RepRap can only make things using materials
that can come out semi-solid (say by heating) and quickly set to a solid.
The RepRap can build things using
ABS (a plastic derived from petroleum
which is basically what Legos are made from),
icing, and a few other materials.
One joked that the RepRap was the world's fanciest glue gun.
<p>
New corn-based materials are now available
that make 3D printing even more compelling.
Plastics made from corn are far more sustainable, and
they're biodegradable too.
One of these materials (PLA) is not water-soluble,
and that would be what you'd typically make components out of.
PLA turns out to be really cheap.
The other material (PVS)
is water-soluble, and solves a key problem with the RepRap when it
first came out: Overhangs.
Because the RepRap (and additive 3D printers like it) build up components
from material starting from the bottom up,
they've historically been unable to build components that have significant
overhangs (parts with with nothing underneath them).
You can now use the water-soluble material to build up a temporary
structure, the same way that some buildings are built.
Then you can put the water-insoluble material on top.
Once you're done building it, you can leave the item in water for a while;
the framework the , and you're left with the object you wanted.
There are apparantly RepRaps with two nozzles
so that this can be done automatically.
The software to do this is still immature; today's most common low-level
data format for final 3D information doesn't let
you specify different materials (or colors) for different parts of an object.
But there's a strong reason now to fix this, and I understand that
the work to fix this is underway.

<p>
3D printers (including the RepRap) can't currently reproduce
their own parts, in particular the metal parts and electronics.
(A RepRap could be used to trace out a circuit board, but not
to make the integrated circuits themselves.)
But they don't need to be able to make <i>everything</i> to be useful.
As I write this, I think these are still somewhat
finicky devices, similar to the state of cars in the early 1900s.
But while the future hasn't quite arrived, I think I can see if from here.

<p>
One issue I hadn't thought about is that people are continuing to
improve the design of the design of RepRap.
Once they improve the design, existing RepRap owners can download the
part design, print it, and update their RepRap.
Physical object upgrades!


<p>
<h2>Zonker's "Year in Open Source Software" talk</h2>
<p>
Zonker gave his view on the state of OSS, both good and bad news.
<p>
He thinks Oracle's purchase of Sun has been overall a bad thing.
"Sun often had deeply flawed management approach, but a good heart;
Oracle doesn’t."
It's really good that LibreOffice has finally forked from OpenOffice.org,
but LibreOffice "should have forked years ago", and the
"LibreOffice people will now have to work hard to catch up,
particularly on name visibility".
<p>
Zonker felt that this was the year that
“Linux became pervasive... and nobody noticed”.
Of course, Linux has long been strong in the server, router,
and supercomputer markets.
OpenStack is a cloud stack that is fully OSS, too.
But now Linux is strong on consumer products, including
the Android phone, Arago, Amazon Kindle, and Nook.
Android has pulled ahead on phones beyond iPad, from near nothing.
Tablets will probably be neck &amp; neck next year, too.
Bdale Garbee (HP) later made a similar point that Linux is nearly
ubiquitous on embedded devices; it's now newsworthy when someone
builds an embedded devices and puts something <i>other</i> than
Linux (such as Windows) on a device.
It's not how many people thought Linux would show up, but show up it has.
<p>
There's been a "copyleft backlash" with some mobile stores
not friendly to copyleft (Apple store forbids GPL,
and Microsoft forbids GPLv3 at least).
I agree that's not good news, but in the long term I think there's a good
chance that this will create a commercial advantage for
Android and other markets that accept copyleft; they will end up with
the better products.
<p>
Contributor agreements are still a big problem.
For example, Canonical's “project Harmony” contributor agreement
lets Canonical turn stuff into proprietary software.
He says (and I agree) that contributor agreements that ask for this
have two problems: (1) might be gobbled up by unfriendly companies, and
(2) they act as a community repellent.
<p>
Great news was the complete victory in the <i>Jacobsen vs. Katzer</i>
case.
This case found that OSS was eligible for copyright damages, even if you
give the software away.
<p>
Debian had all good news, too.
Debian officially welcomed non-developers as voting members,
allowing their artists, etc. full rights.
Remarkably, Debian didn’t have their usual flame-fest this year,
and their leader is running unopposed.
He interprets that as meaning that people seem happy with the current
leadership.
<p>
GNOME is fragmenting, and that is unfortunate.
Canonical will use the Unity shell, Fedora will use GNOME shell,
and some others will stick with older interface.
So now there will be three different user interfaces just for GNOME,
making it even harder to explain how to use the UI.
<p>
In the mobile world “everybody gets sued” and
it’ll get even more litigious next year.
He's pessimistic about patent issues in general,
but there are many bright spots.
<p>
There is a changing face of computing, and in many ways it is
not friendly to freedom.
Computing is moving to phones, yet users will often not control
the computers that they are intimately connected to.
Similarly, many users are moving to social networks
(for many Facebook is the only means of communication they use),
yet again that is progressing toward less freedom.
Zonker believes that we "need to provide alternatives".
He noted Eben Moglen’s FreedomBox effort, which is working to develop
a wall-wart computer you can put in your home to enable freedom.
<p>
There are many bright spots, too.
Firefox is doing great stuff, as is Chrome.
Google pushing WebM for video, and that will be really important.
<p>
He also gave props to
Brad Kuhn’s Software Freedom Conservancy,
which serves as a non-profit umbrella for many OSS projects,
helping them enforce the GPL and providing other services.


<p>
<h2>Steve Benjamin, Mayor of Columbia, SC</h2>
<p>
The mayor gave a short "please take a loot at our city" speech.
He wanted attendees to spend their money here and more importantly
consider moving their businesses to his city.
He argued for things that made the south special such as
Sweet tea (there were claps!), as well as kindness and hospitality
(people still pull over for funerals and open doors for ladies).
He also emphasized the talent pool, such as the many universities nearby.

<p>
<h2>Sourceforge supports git!</h2>
<p>
In one of the many personal discussions that these conferences enable,
I talked with Elizabeth Naramore (Community Development Manager at
Sourceforge).
She revealed that Sourceforge has finally added support for git!
I'm not one of those people who believes that all software configuration
management (SCM) must be done using a distributed system &mdash;
or with git &mdash;
but distributed SCM systems (and specifically git) have a lot of advantages.
It's bizarre that Sourceforge hasn't supported git for so long.
The good news is that the waiting is over.

<p>
<h2>David A. Wheeler's "Look at the Numbers"</h2>
<p>
My talk was the best one, of course :-).
In it, I showed a small set of the many statistics and quantative
studies on OSS.
I had lots of people show up, and that is a good thing.
I will soon
<a href="http://www.dwheeler.com/numbers">post updated slides</a>.

<p>
<h2>After hours Wednesday</h2>
<p>
After the main conference we speakers had a reception at ITology.
Later many people went to various watering holes; I ended up at
the Flying Saucer.
There was an interesting pitch there; whurley
(William Hurley of Chaotic Moon Studios)
was paying for drinks, on the condition that everyone would help develop
requirements and design for an OSS library that he and others would then
implement overnight.  Cool idea, and it looked like a lot
of people were discussing it.
Sadly, I felt really awful (I was fighting a nasty cold),
so I just couldn't stay.
Next time I'll schedule my colds better.

<p>
<h2>Deb Bryant's "Open Source Trends in Government"</h2>
<p>
Deb gave an interesting talk, especially with information on
state and local government use (I tend to watch the U.S.  federal government
so it's interesting to see what others are doing).
She emphasized that government often influences standards and the selection
of products simply from what it uses.
Many governments worldwide now have "competency centers".
She pointed out interesting larger efforts such as
<a href="http://statefusioncenter.com/leadr_at_a_glance.shtml">LEADR</a>,
Apps for Democracy,
Code for America,
Civic Commons,
Civic Apps,
GovHub,
and
<a href="http://ncoms.us">National Consortium for Offender Management
Systems (NCOMS)</a>.
US HHS' CONNECT (modeled on Apache) and the US VA's VistA
are also really important.

<p>
<h2>Alien Arena: OSS First-person Shooter (FPS)</h2>
<p>
I got to talk briefly with John Diamond, CEO of COR Entertainment (LLC)
and maker of
<a href="http://red.planetarena.org">"Alien Arena"</a>.
This is a multiplayer first-person shooter whose code is OSS
(the artwork is closed).
They have clients for at least Windows and Linux.
The thought the best way to release Linux clients is
to give users the source code and have the users compile it as usual
(./configure &amp;&amp; make &amp;&amp; make install); this worked
nicely everywhere.
For its technical underpinnings it uses OpenGL; clearly OpenGL
can be used for high-speed games!
I fiddled with it, but
I've never been good at games requiring good reaction speeds;
I've even had to have others playtest the videogames I've written.
That's still true, sadly.

<p>
<h2>David Duggins' "Starting and Running Business on-the-cheap with Open Source"</h2>
<p>
David Duggins pointed out various well-respected programs.
If you didn't know about them, then you really needed to hear about them.
He pointed out OpenOffice.org/LibreOffice (office suite),
Firefox (web browser), Thunderbird (email client), GIMP (image editor),
GNU Cash (simple accounting), and SugarCRM (more sophisticated).
For promoting businesses / running basic web sites we pointed out
Joomla, Drupal, and WordPress as the big ones.
If you need much more specialized programs, frameworks such as
PHP+MySQL, Ruby on Rails, and Django (based on Python) may fit the bill.
