<h1 class="title">Learning from Disaster</h1>

Many serious computer security vulnerabilities have been found
over the years.
I believe that those involved in developing or operating computer systems
can - and <i>should</i> - learn from these past mistakes.

<p>
This is a collection of essays, mostly by me, that briefly explain
what happened and  focus on
<i>lessons to be learned</i> from various vulnerabilities or
computer security problems (aka &#8220;disasters&#8221;).
We humans have been sitting around campfires since ancient times,
telling stories and trying to glean future lessons from those stories.
These are far more modern stories, but these stories
<i>really did happen</i> and there are
<i>important lessons to be learned</i> from them.
Please, sit back and enjoy the stories... but more importantly,
please apply some of these lessons to prevent them from happening again.

<p>

Each disaster is fundamentally a story of things that went wrong.
I think each tale is really interesting, especially since they
each give us an opportunity to learn and do better.
I hope you take some of those lessons to heart.
Perhaps more importantly, I hope you use these as examples of ways
to look at other events to determine what can be learned from them.
If we do not learn from history, we risk repeating it.
