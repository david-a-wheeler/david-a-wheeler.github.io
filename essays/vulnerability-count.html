<i>This paper attempts to estimate the number of reported vulnerabilities
that apply to base GNU/Linux operating systems, and compare that number
to Microsoft Windows.
The CVE vulnerability reports make it appear that
Linux-based operating systems have more vulnerability
reports than Microsoft Windows, but
this is simply an artifact of how the different systems are packaged.
Once similar functionality is compared (by comparing
a "base operating system"), Linux-based operating systems
appear to have a similar number of vulnerabilities to
Microsoft Windows systems.
Even more interestingly, GNU/Linux systems have significantly fewer
reports of high-severity vulnerabilities than Microsoft Windows.
Neither line is perfect or
as good as customers want them to be;
hopefully competition will drive everyone
towards creating more secure products.

<h1><a name="introduction">Introduction</a></h1>
<p>
Green Hills Software says that CVE reports that Linux has many more
vulnerabilities than Windows.
So, I checked into this claim.
<p>
A quick search query appears to confirm this claim at first,
at least in a sense.
<a href="http://icat.nist.gov/icat.cfm">
The ICAT Metabase from NIST</a> takes the vulnerability index of
CVE and turns it into a searchable form.
I used the version of ICAT that used the CVE database of 9/28/04
containing 6952 vulnerabilities, as of Oct 19, 2004.
If the 'exposed component type' is set to 'operating system', a
keyword search on "Windows" reports 245 vulnerabilities,
while "Linux" reports 320 with the same setting.
<p>
But looking into this further reveals that this is not the full story.
The problem is that the functionality defined as
the "operating system" by these databases is significantly different
between Microsoft Windows and a GNU/Linux operating system.
A typical GNU/Linux distribution doesn't just include low-level
components such as a kernel and graphical infrastructure; it also
includes compilers, office suites, software configuration management systems,
and so on.
Thus, these counts aren't really comparing the same thing at all;
the same component would be included in a Linux count, but not in the
Windows count, making the comparison invalid.
<p>
So to compare the vulnerability counts, we need to compare the same
functionality; I'll call this functionality a "base operating system."
For purposes of this paper,
a base operating system is that portion of the operating system
that is normally included in an installation, even for a single-purpose
application such as a web server or office workstation.
In particular, the base operating system for our purposes includes
the operating system kernel, basic system libraries (such as C libraries),
graphical user interface (GUI) including expected libraries for
image display, default filesystem and authentication
mechanisms, and the basic libraries that are difficult to
<i>not</i> include during installation.
It doesn't include a Java Virtual Machine or other
components that people <i>may</i> install but certainly don't have to.
There are certainly a few edge cases where it can be a little difficult
to make this distinction, in part because these architectures
are so different.
This definition slightly favors Microsoft Windows, because
it's impractical to remove many components such as the
GUI from Windows, and difficult to remove the browser,
but it's easy to do those things in GNU/Linux.
Thus, the minimal
"base operating system" of a GNU/Linux system can actually be
made much smaller than this definition requires.
The ability to really minimize the operating system is very
helpful for building single-purpose applications and improving security,
but isn't the point of this paper.
So instead, I'll intentionally choose a definition that is easy for
both a Windows system and GNU/Linux system to meet, and is understandable
for an ordinary computer-knowledgeable customer.
This definition will suit our purposes, which is to compare
equivalent things.
<!--
<p>
I'll include drivers in the base operating system.
This may unintentionally lower the vulnerability count of Windows.
GNU/Linux drivers are almost always developed by the GNU/Linux developers.
In constrast, Windows drivers are often developed and provided by the
individual product manufacturer, and it's not at all clear that
they are always assigned to the "operating system" by the ICAT/CVE
maintainers.
Thus, this may unintentionally skew the results to favor Microsoft Windows,
since the same driver with the same vulnerability might be included
in GNU/Linux, but not included in Windows if Microsoft didn't include
the driver in their operating system.
-->
<p>
There are many versions of Windows, and many distributions of GNU/Linux.
For this analysis, I include vulnerabilities that impact
any, but I make sure that each different vulnerability is only counted once.
I could have also examined other systems as well (such as OpenBSD),
but I have limited time, so I chose to not do so.


<h1><a name="calculations">Calculations</a></h1>
<p>
Frankly, I just don't have the time to analyze each of the 565 entries.
So, I selected the 60 most recent entries for each,
determined which ones were actually relevant to the base operating system,
and I then did a linear extrapolation
of the number of vulnerabilities actually relevant to the
various operating systems.
Selecting 60 for each meant I examined 120 entries, over 20% of the total
number of entries, so I examined a pretty large sample!
The number "60" is just because ICAT presents information in groups of 20,
and I wanted to look at over 100 entries to get an accurate estimate.
The details are shown in the appendix.
<p>
For the GNU/Linux operating systems, only 38 of the 60 sampled
vulnerabilities applied to the base operating system.
Many of the "operating system" vulnerabilities were actually
vulnerabilities in CVS, a software configuration management system.
It's true that CVS is often included in the CD-ROM of a typical
Linux distribution, but because it's only of use to developers, few
users install it; it certainly shouldn't be considered part of the
base operating system.
Other vulnerabilities charged here included vulnerabilities
for the Apache web server, the MetaMail server and the irssi chat client,
none of which are part of the base operating system.
A few relate to Samba, but Samba is primarily used for interoperation
with Windows systems, and is not the default file service for these
systems.
The LHA unarchiving tool is charged, but this isn't a tool installed
by most users.
Note that two of the vulnerabilities <i>only</i> applied to SuSE.
<p>
For Microsoft Windows, only 47 out of the 60 sampled vulnerabilities
applied to the base operating system.
Again, the LHA unarchiving tool is charged, unfairly, to the operating system.
Other assignments that don't really belong in the base operating system
include vulnerabilities in
Microsoft Exchange 2003 and Outlook Web Access (OWA),
FrontPage Server Extensions, and
Microsoft SQL Server.
I intentionally didn't include Microsoft's Java virtual machine
or Jscript; you could argue that I <i>should</i> have counted those
in the base operating system.

<p>
For Linux operating systems, there were 320 vulnerability reports, but
out of the first 60 only 38 were relevant.
For Windows, there were 245 vulnerability reports, but
out of its first 60 only 47 were relevant.
Now we can estimate the number of relevant vulnerabilities:
<pre>
 Linux   base OS vulnerabilities = 320 * (38/60) = 202
 Windows base OS vulnerabilities = 245 * (47/60) = 192
</pre>
<p>
Thus, it appears that Linux and Windows have similar
totals numbers of vulnerabilies in total; Linux still has slightly more,
but not significantly so.
<p>
But that's not really the most interesting story.
Up to this point we've ignored a key issue:
not all security vulnerabilities are equal.
What's most important is that we not have the most severe security
vulnerabilities.
And here, suddenly the differences between the vulnerabilities is
striking.
<p>
On the Linux side, only 9 out of the 60 sampled vulnerabilities
apply to the base operating system and have severity level "high".
In contrast, on the Windows side, 30 out of the 60 (half!)
of the sampled vulnerabilities apply to the base operating system and
have severity level "high".
Once again, let's estimate the totals:
<pre>
 Linux   base OS vulnerabilities, high severity = 320 * (9/60)  =  48
 Windows base OS vulnerabilities, high severity = 245 * (30/60) = 123
</pre>
This is striking; Windows appears to have about 2.5 times as many
"high severity" vulnerabilities as GNU/Linux in the base operating system.
Looking at low vulnerabilities gives a similar picture.
On the Linux side, 6 of 60 vulnerabilities apply to the base operating system
and have "low severity", while only 2 of 60 Windows vulnerabilities can
say the same.
Which simply emphasizes the point; the Linux vulnerabilities in general
are less severe.

<h1><a name="conclusions">Conclusions</a></h1>
<p>
At a first glance at the CVE vulnerability reports,
it looks like Linux-based operating systems have more vulnerability
reports than Microsoft Windows.
But it turns out that this is simply
an artifact of how the different systems are packaged.
Once similar functionality is compared (by comparing
a "base operating system"), Linux-based operating systems
appear to have a similar number of vulnerabilities to
Microsoft Windows systems.
Even more interestingly, GNU/Linux systems have significantly fewer
reports of high-severity vulnerabilities than Microsoft Windows.

<p>
It's important to take vulnerability counts with large grains of salt.
Large counts can be because a product has lots of vulnerabilities, or
because lots of people are working to find and remove vulnerabilities
(and thus reporting more of them).
Still, there's certainly evidence here (and elsewhere) that people <i>are</i>
working to find and remove vulnerabilities in both, so it's
plausible to claim that lower counts suggest that there are
fewer vulnerabilities.
The real question, of course, is how many latent vulnerabilities there are;
no one can predict the future, but if many vulnerabilities are being found
now, it's reasonable to expect that more such vulnerabilities will be found
again soon at a similar rate.
Since open source software / Free Software (OSS/FS) projects'
vulnerabilities, once reported, aren't easily hidden,
OSS/FS projects are probably more likely
to be reported to CVE than a proprietary product's
(inflating their vulnerability counts).
In spite of this inflationary factor, the OSS/FS operating systems based
on Linux show well by comparison.

<p>
Of course, none of this is to say that either product is perfect, or
as good as customers want them to be.
The goal should be zero defects, for both GNU/Linux and Microsoft Windows.
I believe that Microsoft has been actively working over the
past two years to actively reduce security problems in its products,
to its great credit.
Still, these figures suggest that GNU/Linux is doing well in comparison
to Microsoft Windows, with a slightly smaller number of vulnerability reports
in total, and significantly smaller high severity vulnerability reports.
It's my hope that competition will drive everyone
towards creating more secure products.
