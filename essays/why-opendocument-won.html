and other places,
the State of Massachusetts is backing the <i>OpenDocument</i> standard
as the standard format for office applications, text documents, spreadsheets,
charts and graphical documents like drawings and presentations.
All Massachusetts agencies are expected to migrate by January 1, 2007.
This is <i>instead</i> of Microsoft&#8217;s new Office XML format
(aka Microsoft Office Open XML File format).

<p>
This is big news.
Currently most people exchange office documents using Microsoft&#8217;s binary
formats (known as .doc, .ppt, and .xls), but now that the XML technologies are
available and more mature, many people want to switch to an
XML-based approach.
There&#8217;s general acceptance in the information technology community
that for office documents
some XML format will eventually replace the obsolete binary formats.
Most people, a few years ago, expected that
whatever XML format Microsoft created would win.
Yet Microsoft appears to have lost the war, due to
its own poor decisions.

<p>
Microsoft is predictably howling about this news,
<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/brian_jones/archive/2005/08/31/458879.aspx">
saying they are a
&#8220;bit stunned&#8221; and that the results were &#8220;unnecessarily exclusive&#8221;.</a> 
Microsoft better be prepared to be more stunned.
Government officials in Massachusetts, Europe, and elsewhere,
have been repeatedly telling Microsoft to
stop posturing and actually meet their customers&#8217; needs for complete
interoperability, with no restrictions.
Yet Microsoft has steadfastly refused to meet their customers&#8217; needs, and
they&#8217;ve done it so long that customers have abandoned their format.
(Microsoft says they're open, but people who have independently
evaluated the situation have determined that it's not true.)
I suspect Massachusetts is only the first of many; governments around
the world are working out their standards, preparing for the leap
to XML-based office formats.
The rest of industry is likely to follow suit, because they have many of
the same needs and desires for long-lived documents and competitive suppliers.
The best information
available suggests that <i>everyone</i> is switching to OpenDocument,
for all the same reasons,
leaving Microsoft with a proprietary format no one wants to use.
<blockquote>
UPDATE: Almost immediately after I wrote this paragraph,
<a href="http://www.desktoplinux.com/news/NS3370503002.html">
Indonesia's Ministry of Research and Technology announced that
it will implement Java Desktop System (JDS) on Linux as a
national-standard desktop</a>. It plans to install it across Indonesia,
<i>beginning</i> with its government-affiliated offices.
JDS includes StarOffice, which is expected to soon release its OpenDocument
implementation as its default file format.
It sure doesn't take long for the steamroller to get moving, and the
big kicker will probably be the European Union.
<!-- September 15, 2005 -->
</blockquote>

<p>
This article explains why things currently look so grim for
Microsoft&#8217;s proprietary XML format, and so bright for OpenDocument.
In some sense, a declaration that OpenDocument &#8220;won&#8221; on September 2005
is very early; who knows what will happen?
But this is more than a snappy title;
the tea leaves are looking really bad right now for Microsoft&#8217;s dreams to
solely control the format used by all future office documents.
In fact, if they don&#8217;t hurry, Microsoft could conceivably find their
Office suite slowly moving into the dumpster
with WordStar, VisiCalc, Lotus 1-2-3, dBase, and other former office leaders.
That would be mind-boggling, but it&#8217;s occurred many times before --
who would have thought that any of those predecessors would stumble?
I don&#8217;t think that&#8217;ll happen in this case, at least not so
quickly, but it&#8217;s certainly a risk unless Microsoft changes direction.
That would be horrific for them; Office is 40% of their revenue, and one
of the primary reasons people use their operating system (which accounts for
most of the rest of their non-investment income).

<p>
I&#8217;m more hopeful; Microsoft has historically changed direction
when it needed to embrace a standard, and they can easily do it in this case.
For example, around 1995 it suddenly and finally embraced the
Internet standards, dropping its own networking standards that no one wanted.
I think (and hope)
that good sense will prevail on Microsoft in this case too -- in other words,
that they&#8217;ll embrace OpenDocument and continue to sell products.
If you can only read one other piece on this topic, take a look at
<a href="http://comment.zdnet.co.uk/other/0,39020682,39216101,00.htm">
ZDNet's "Microsoft must drop its Office politics"</a>, which is a good article.
ZDNet concludes "Microsoft has a very simple path open to it ... include
OpenDocument compatibility in its software. ...
it either adopts the industry standard or gets locked out.
It may not like this -- it prefers to use this logic to cow its competitors --
but it should have no reason to avoid a level playing field."

<p>
It looks like Microsoft gambled, and lost. Let&#8217;s see why, by looking
at what governments are looking for... and why Microsoft chose to not compete.


<h1>Why Would a Government Choose OpenDocument?</h1>

<p>
In many ways this decision was fairly obvious.
OpenDocument appears, at
this point, to be <b>the</b> way to go, with no realistic alternative,
for any government.
The only real contenders were:
<ol>
<li>Microsoft Office binary format, the current common interchange format.
But this is being abandoned by Microsoft,
fails to exploit the newer XML technologies (thus giving
up their advantages), and because it&#8217;s undocumented it&#8217;s causing continuous
information loss. Just try to read Office documents from 10 years ago --
you&#8217;ll often fail.
Now remember that governments need them in future centuries.
They&#8217;re not meeting the need, so an alternative is needed.
<li>Going with Microsoft Office XML, which as shown below, doesn&#8217;t meet
government minimum requirements such as allowing any supplier to
implement it. And implementations aren&#8217;t even available yet, though
at this point that probably doesn&#8217;t matter any more.
<li>OpenDocument, the only official standard. It&#8217;s already implemented
by multiple vendors (including some at no cost), and it&#8217;s the only one
that really meets government needs... and with a massive lead time to boot.
</ol>
<p>
Other formats aren&#8217;t really competitive.
PDF is a very useful display format, but it has a different purpose --
while it&#8217;s great at preserving formatting, it doesn&#8217;t let you
<i>edit</i> the data meaningfully.
HTML is great for web pages, or short documents, but it&#8217;s
just not capable enough for these kinds of tasks.
And so on.
Both HTML and PDF will continue to be used, but they cannot be used as
a complete replacement; people need what OpenDocument (or its
Microsoft competitor) provides.
<p>
So let&#8217;s examine in more detail to see why OpenDocument is such an
obvious success, by first looking at the requirements governments have.
Governments
don&#8217;t create office documents so that they can be tossed in the shredder.  They
often have to be accessible decades or centuries later, and many of them have to
be accessible to <i>any</i> citizen, regardless of what equipment they use or
will use.
Let&#8217;s look at the kinds of issues governments (like Massachusetts)
finds itself confronted with, by looking at their
typical requirements for a modern office format:
<ol>
<li><b>An XML-based format</b>. Now that XML is available, governments
want a single format that uses XML for its many advantages
(e.g., easy standard processing, flexibility,
easy growth
to arbitrary sizes, ease of repair/recovery, and interoperability). 
Binary formats have real trouble with extensibility, for example;
if they assign
one byte to a value, and later discover that they need more than one byte, it&#8217;s
difficult to change anything, while in XML you just write the larger number. 
Repair and recovery of corrupted data is also much easier with an XML format.
A scrambled binary file is often unrecoverable, and
unspecified binary formats are especially bad off
are worse (if the program says &#8220;failed to load&#8221;
there may be nothing you can do, even if there&#8217;s
some recoverable data before the scrambled point).
In XML, if some data is scrambled, you can generally recover all the rest.
Since compression is a separate step, an error in a <i>generating</i>
program will still usually produce mostly-correct data, again
protecting against loss.
An error in the final compressed file
(both OpenDocument and Microsoft XML are compressed) makes
recovering <i>after</i> the scrambled point more difficult,
but you can typically recover the data <i>before</i> scrambled section.
You can often often recover the rest by detecting where the error occurred and
automatically trying various alternatives.
<p>
But the biggest reason for XML is to make it extremely easy for <i>anyone</i>
to quickly make tools that can read, write, and manipulate the data.
If you only use one program, ever, to read a format, it&#8217;s livable if
the format is bizarre (like Microsoft&#8217;s current binary format is).
But now that everything is networked, people want to quickly take pieces
of data from many sources and combine them in new ways, and that demands
a data format that&#8217;s much more flexible and accessible to any tool.
XML was designed to do just this, so people want some kind of
XML format.
For office data,
the choice is either OpenDocument or Microsoft&#8217;s XML format.
<p>
<li><b>A specification</b>.
In the long term, all formats disappear.  WordStar was once
what <i>everyone</i> used as their word processor; now,
even filters to read the format are less and less common.
Luckily, WordStar format is similar to ASCII and is thus
mostly recoverable.
Worse, today, I can&#8217;t read some important PowerPoint 4 files in
today&#8217;s PowerPoint, only 7 years later.
Loss of critical data in only 7 years is unacceptable to me,
and governments think in terms of decades and centuries.
Yet it happens, because there&#8217;s still no specification
for the (now obsolete) Microsoft Office format.
If there&#8217;s no spec, there&#8217;s no standard.
<p>
An aside: Microsoft program manager Adam Barr has suggested
<a href="http://www.proudlyserving.com/archives/2005/09/an_open_letter.html">
releasing a specification for the older Microsoft office binary formats.</a>
That would go a <i>long</i> way to improving interoperability, and if they
did that (in a way that allowed any competitor to implement them)
I&#8217;d be delighted.
This would certainly be a big help to many
as long as arbitrary competitors could use the format
(as opposed to the current license for the Microsoft XML format).
It&#8217;s not even clear that Microsoft <i>could</i> really limit the license,
since you&#8217;re not supposed to be able to patent things that already exist
in the public for more than a year.
That would not provide the benefits of XML, obviously, but it might mean
that a transition to XML could happen in a slower manner (since there would
be less concern about data loss, a serious concern today).
I have not seen any evidence that Microsoft will do that, unfortunately.

<p>
<li><b>Neutral specification maintainer, preferably a respected
pre-existing standards body</b>. OpenDocument has been developed and is
maintained by a vendor-neutral body (OASIS); OASIS is even authorized to submit
its specifications straight to ISO.  Heck, Microsoft is even a member
of OASIS; they certainly can&#8217;t claim ignorance of OpenDocument.
Microsoft hasn&#8217;t even <i>begun</i> a
standards process for its format.
In May 2004 the European Union specifically told Microsoft to get involved
with the OpenDocument standards effort, and that they considered the "winner"
to be the one that became an international standard.
At this point they&#8217;re too late -- the
standards train already left the station, and arrived at the destination called
OpenDocument.
Patrick Gannon, president and CEO of OASIS, noted that
<a href="http://www.govtech.net/news/news.php?id=96645">
"many European governments are considering similar policies
[to require OpenDocument, like Massachusetts]"</a>, and it will be
a topic of discussion at OASIS' European Adoption Forum in London,
17 October 2005. 
<p>
<li><b>Multi-vendor/customer development</b>.
The only way to make
sure that all critical user needs and supplier issues are addressed is to get
many different organizations to co-develop the specification, along with
public feedback.
Microsoft&#8217;s XML format didn&#8217;t; its development was
completely controlled by Microsoft.
That&#8217;s a terrible misstep for something that is supposed to be
used worldwide, in perpetuity, for trillions of dollars worth
of documents.
Though first draft
specifications are often created by a single person or small group,
you <i>have</i> to get widespread review to get a good final result.

<p>
<li><b>Multiple implementations.</b> There are now
multiple implementations of OpenDocument, with probably more to be announced
soon. Governments don&#8217;t want to be locked into a single vendor, nor to force
their citizens to do so.  The costs go sky-high, and support vanishes, when
there&#8217;s no competition. Only one vendor really supports the Microsoft XML
format.
Note that having multiple implementations is the best way to ensure that
specification actually provides interoperability; the IETF even requires this
for its standards because of this.
Microsoft has mouthed nonsense such as claiming OpenDocument is only
designed for OpenOffice.org, but multiple implementations show it false.
<p>
<li><b>Anyone can implement the specification</b>.
Anyone can implement OpenDocument, and that&#8217;s <i>not</i> true for
Microsoft&#8217;s format.
Today, there are too many
people and too many programs that need access to the data in office
documents.
Thus, it&#8217;s critical that anyone be able to implement an office format,
especially since it&#8217;s the whole point of using XML.
<p>
This point seems to be the hardest for some people to understand, so
here&#8217;s more detail.
The bottom line: Microsoft licenses this format in a way
that says, &#8220;you can use it freely,
unless you&#8217;re a competitor&#8221;.
And that&#8217;s a poison pill for any format like this, because governments
<i>want</i> competition.
<p>
<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/brian_jones/archive/2005/08/31/458879.aspx">
Microsoft itself acknowledges the need</a> for an open format, saying that
&#8220;Moving to document formats that are open, documented,
and royalty-free is actually really valuable....
[because it makes your files] totally belong to you [so] you
have control over them.&#8221;
Good words!
But there are words, and there are actions; governments are not always stupid.
To meet such requirements, any such format
has to be implementable by <i>any</i> proprietary program and by
<i>any</i> open source software, <i>at least</i>
using the licenses typical for each.
Fifteen years ago it was easy to ignore open source software, but now
the market has all sorts of open source software.
Nowadays, governments cannot in fairness mandate a standard
that forbids implementations that use the most popular licenses
for open source software;
blatantly discriminatory regulations like that
can bring officials into court.
<p>
And let&#8217;s be blunt:
<a href="https://dwheeler.com/essays/gpl-compatible.html">the
most common license for open source software is the GNU GPL version 2</a>,
so any office format must be implementable
by a program released under the GNU GPL.
<a href="https://dwheeler.com/essays/gpl-compatible.html">See here
for GPL stats</a>. I looked up the data again on September 1, 2005; <a
href="http://freshmeat.net/stats/">Freshmeat&#8217;s statistics</a> report that 67.41%
of branches used the GPL, with the next-closest being LGPL (6.06%) and original
BSD (3.34%).  Even if you pretended that all non-GPL licenses were identical,
when combined they&#8217;re still the minority.  Not all backers of open source
software like or use the GPL, but making it illegal to use such a widely-used
license, for no good reason in public policy, is lunacy.

<p>
Microsoft hasn&#8217;t been willing to license its products
for absolutely anyone to use, so it&#8217;s been unwilling to release
a specification that&#8217;s appropriate for government use.
Instead, Microsoft has
only been willing to release a
specification as long as it can&#8217;t be used by some of Microsoft&#8217;s
primary competition, by creating weird legal licensing clauses that prevent
interoperation and competition.
<a href="http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,1759,1829728,00.asp">
Microsoft&#8217;s XML format cannot be implemented by programs
licensed under the GNU GPL</a>, for example.
Under U.S. law, Microsoft is allowed to write specifications that exclude
competitors, but it shouldn&#8217;t be surprised if people choose to not use them.
Especially since there are current office suite products that use licenses
that appear to be excluded by Microsoft's terms
(Gnumeric and AbiWord at least use the GPL; OpenOffice.org uses the
related LGPL, and it's not clear they can use it either).
There's no reason to lock out these market players.
Remember, the whole point of the XML formats is to let <i>anyone</i>
read and write them, if they choose.

<p>
In contrast, the OpenDocument specification can be implemented by anyone
who uses any license, proprietary or open source -- including
the GNU GPL license and Microsoft&#8217;s current Office license.
So OpenDocument is open for anyone to implement, including Microsoft... while
Microsoft&#8217;s XML format isn&#8217;t.
<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/brian_jones/archive/2005/08/31/458879.aspx">
Microsoft&#8217;s claim that OpenDocument is &#8220;unnecessarily
exclusive&#8221; is nonsense</a>; the shoe is on the other foot.
I&#8217;d say this reason,
by itself, is sufficient to disqualify Microsoft&#8217;s XML format from any
government consideration, no matter what its capabilities, because it fails to
give users the option of choosing what program or system they can use.
Microsoft is just trying to prevent competition here.
The
<a href="http://europa.eu.int/idabc/en/document/2592/5588">European Union</a>,
<a href="http://www-128.ibm.com/developerworks/blogs/dw_blog_comments.jspa?blog=384&amp;entry=83074">IBM's Bob Sutor</a>
and many others all warn against this.
Other countries are even less likely to accept Microsoft&#8217;s XML format;
while Massachusetts sees Microsoft as a domestic
company, other countries will see Microsoft as a foreign company and be
<i>very uninterested</i> in forbidding competition against a foreign company.

<p>
Massachusetts&#8217; Kriss emphasized that Massachusetts is not moving
to open standards for economic reasons, but to protect the right
of the public to open and free access to public documents, permanently.
&#8220;What we&#8217;ve backed away from at this point is the use of a
proprietary standard and we want standards that are published
and free of legal encumbrances, and we don’t want two standards.&#8221;

<p>
Perhaps an analogy would help explain this.
I expect
that Microsoft would be unhappy if Massachusetts mandated that only GPL&#8217;ed
software could be used by Massachusetts. Yet if Massachusetts did that, they
could at least argue the advantages of doing so in terms of transparency of the
code.  (No, I&#8217;m not arguing that Massachusetts <i>should</i> do that, I&#8217;m just
trying to make a point.) In contrast, Microsoft wants Massachusetts to mandate
that GPL&#8217;ed software be <i>forbidden</i> for use in office suites.  There&#8217;s no
good public policy reason to do that, and lots of competitive reasons to avoid
doing so.  Especially when there&#8217;s a ready alternative -- an international
standard, already implemented multiple times, including some high-quality
freely-available implementations (giving them a range of options). I get the
impression that Massachusetts worked really hard with Microsoft to get them to
change the license to something more reasonable, so that Microsoft wouldn&#8217;t so
obviously disqualify its work. Yet Microsoft continues to try to promulgate a
specification license that forbids competition. Expecting any government to
perpetually forbid the use of competing office suites is ridiculous,
and Microsoft should have known better.
I think they did know better, and hoped no one would notice.

<p>
<li><b>Low-cost implementations</b>.
Not everyone is made of money.
Governments have to interact with people who have little money, and governments
are often strapped themselves.
For OpenDocument, this is a no-brainer.
Some OpenDocument implementations are available at no cost
(particularly OpenOffice.org and KDE KOffice) and have a
licensing structure that allows that to continue that way indefinitely.
And these are good programs, not poor quality demos.
Even if you choose to use a non-free implementation (say StarOffice
or Microsoft Office with an OpenDocument plug-in), this is obviously a big
advantage to you, because it constrains the office suite prices.
No such luck with Microsoft&#8217;s XML format;
Microsoft XML is only available in the latest version of Office.
Indeed, their licensing is carefully designed to prevent the most likely
kinds of competition (it&#8217;s &#8220;free&#8221; as long as you&#8217;re not a real competitor).
So to get Microsoft&#8217;s XML, you&#8217;d have to upgrade
huge groups of people at a corresponding huge cost.
There really isn&#8217;t even a competition between these two formats.
And it gets worse; since no one else is supporting Microsoft XML,
Microsoft XML will probably stay expensive to deploy, due to a
lack of competition, especially if more people try to use it.
This becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy; if more people try to use it,
Microsoft will have incentive to raise the price (to get more money out of
it), which in the long term will cause people to stop using it.

<p>
<li><b>Support is already available for OpenDocument.</b>
OpenDocument is already out, and already getting used, so that lowers the risk.
In fact, OpenDocument was developed based on lessons learned from the
older OpenOffice.org format (they aren&#8217;t the same, but they&#8217;re similar,
and the changes were made based on widespread review.)
Microsoft&#8217;s full XML format still hasn&#8217;t even been fielded
(it&#8217;s coming soon); it&#8217;s based on previous Office 2003 work, but
that was never used as Office&#8217;s primary format, didn&#8217;t support critical
components like PowerPoint, and the older version didn&#8217;t support all the
functionality of the product.
OpenDocument support is already out, and it appears more mature, especially
if you consider multivendor support.
As of yet I&#8217;ve seen no evidence of
significant multivendor office suite support for Microsoft&#8217;s XML format.
</ol>

<p>
The story here seems clear.
Microsoft gambled that, because most current office users use their
Office program, customers would choose
Microsoft&#8217;s XML format <i>even though
Microsoft&#8217;s format did not meet their requirements</i>.
It appears that they hoped that, by creating subtle license traps,
they would foreclose future competition, but make it look good enough
that government officials wouldn&#8217;t understand the issues.
Perhaps they expected that people wouldn&#8217;t examine
their options carefully;
an odd assumption, since so much money and data is at stake.
Government folks are often overworked, yes, but there are a lot of
smart people in government.

<p>
Government people can act especially smartly when they get
good tips from others.
A few years ago, secret Microsoft documents now named
<a href="http://www.opensource.org/halloween/halloween1.html">Halloween I</a>
and
<a href="http://www.opensource.org/halloween/halloween2.html">Halloween II</a>
were exposed to the world.
These documents were developed in collaboration with key people in Microsoft.
Their bottom line was a recommendation that
Microsoft suppress competition by &#8220;de-commoditizing&#8221; protocols
(creating proprietary formats that could not be used by others)
and by attacking competitors through patent lawsuits.
Since that time, people have been watching carefully and
<a href="http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,1759,1829728,00.asp">warning
when Microsoft tries to &#8220;release&#8221; formats whose conditions inhibit
competition</a>.

<p>
<a href="http://comment.zdnet.co.uk/other/0,39020682,39216101,00.htm">
ZDNet came to a similar conclusion</a>, saying,
"[when] open standards exist which are capable of supporting
the work the state does, this should be an unexceptional decision;
accessibility for as broad a range of citizens and organisations
as possible is a primary responsibility for any government."
<a href="http://europa.eu.int/idabc/en/document/2592/5588">The
European Union said, similarly,</a>
"Because of its specific role in society, the public sector must
avoid that a specific product is forced on anyone interacting
with it electronically. Conversely, any document format
that does not discriminate against market actors and that
can be implemented across platforms should be encouraged.
Likewise, the public sector should avoid any format that
does not safeguard equal opportunities to market actors to implement
format-processing applications, especially where this might
impose product selection on the side of citizens or businesses.
In this respect standardisation initiatives will ensure not only a
fair and competitive market but will also help safeguard the
interoperability of implementing solutions whilst preserving
competition and innovation."

<p>
Customers, in this case governments, didn&#8217;t just accept whatever
terms Microsoft gave them.
That makes sense; few people just sign a blank check!
Instead, they
looked at the alternatives, found one that actually met their requirements, and
chose that alternative instead.
Now governments are starting to
formally state their requirements, in terms of industry specifications,
so that any supplier meet their needs.
Suppliers can now choose to implement the
specification and compete on cost, functionality, flexibility, consistency with
public policy, and so on... or they can choose to not compete, and
automatically lose.
In other words, governments can do what governments
usually do -- they can set a fair requirement that anyone can meet, clearly
justified by their needs, and then use whichever suppliers
best meets their requirements (in this case, for an interoperable format).
This is not anti-Microsoft; governments have been specifically asking
Microsoft for years to co-develop formats anyone can use, and Microsoft
can implement the resulting industry standard, OpenDocument.

<p>
While the rest of industry doesn&#8217;t have the same needs as government,
they have to <i>work</i> with governments, so government decisions sometimes
have a trickle-down effect.
Also, industry also has documents that need to be retrievable in the
future, and the certainly want the lower costs and higher quality that
tend to come from competition.
So, as governments start making and announcing decisions in this direction,
it&#8217;s reasonable to expect in this specific area that much of industry
will follow.
It&#8217;s true that Massachusetts all by itself cannot change the world, but
Massachusetts has the same problems of many large governments, and it&#8217;s
reasonable to think that if Massachusetts makes this selection, other
governments will too.

<h1>So is OpenDocument any Good?</h1>
<p>
Is OpenDocument any good?
Yes. In short, OpenDocument is a really good specification.

The Future Is Open: What OpenDocument Is And Why You Should Care by Daniel Carrera</a> gives some information on the advantages of OpenDocument.
<a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2004/09/24/SmartEC">Tim Bray also makes some interesting comments</a>.
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenDocument">Wikipedia&#8217;s OpenDocument article</a> has some interesting information.

<p>
You can sometimes learn a lot about something by seeing how it was
created, and by who -- and that&#8217;s true here.
OpenDocument was developed by many office suite developers, including
those who develop <a href="http://www.openoffice.org">OpenOffice.org</a>,
StarOffice, KDE&#8217;s KOffice, and Word Perfect (Corel).
But some major users were involved, too, to make sure that their needs
were met.
Boeing was there; they have large, complicated documents, so
their participation helped make sure that complex documents could be
handled well.
A Bible translation group also participated; they have lots of complex
language needs, including multi-language documents and unusual languages;
as a result,
OpenDocument generally handles internationalization issues in a stellar way.
They also allowed review by the public;
I took that opportunity and voluntarily sent in comments, as did others.
And they used as a basis an existing XML format (OpenOffice&#8217;s);
this gave them a big leg up on Microsoft, whose previous XML work for
Office documents did not cover key areas (Powerpoint, for example).
This is how you get a good specification lasts a long time;
you start with pre-existing work, and get many participants with different
needs to work out any of its problems.

<p>
Contrast OpenDocument with Microsoft&#8217;s XML format.
Last I saw, perfectly normal office-only documents
can contain binary objects that depend on MS Office and
Windows (e.g., OLE) and those lack complete documentation.
But most importantly, its license essentially disqualifies it.

<p>
Though I wasn't on the committee that developed it, during their public
comment period I read it myself and sent in a few comments.
I was generally pleased with it after I reviewed it;
there&#8217;s a lot of good to say about it.
It&#8217;s actually quite clear to read, as these things go.
And the careful crafting, and review by many, shows in the result.
It's smaller than it might otherwise be, because they reused pre-existing
standards instead of rolling their own
(which is also a good idea in most cases).
Now, OpenDocument isn&#8217;t perfect; no human product is.
In particular, it underspecifies formulas in spreadsheets.
It <i>covers</i> spreadsheets, including formatting, pivot tables, data,
and lots of other issues, and gives examples of correct formulas,
but doesn&#8217;t define in
enough rigor the actual format for calculated formulas in spreadsheets.
But the problem is underspecification, not that the specification that's there
is bad, and for simple spreadsheets the material that's available is
enough to get started.
I found that to be a weakness, so I voluntarily developed a document called
<a href="https://dwheeler.com/openformula">OpenFormula</a> to try
to address this.
In any case, this turns out to be relatively easy to address;
it&#8217;s certainly easier to address than
the mess Microsoft has created for itself.
And since there are multiple implementations of OpenDocument today, these
sorts of weaknesses have already been identified and are being addressed.
In contrast, Microsoft&#8217;s constraining licenses have restrained the kind of
multi-vendor testing that is needed for good, long-lasting standards.


<h1>What Can Microsoft Do?</h1>

<p>
Now Microsoft&#8217;s in a minor bind. The world is
already switching to OpenDocument, and now that all the other suppliers have
invested in OpenDocument and have it working, there&#8217;s really no real incentive
to use an alternative.

<p>
If Microsoft wanted to suddenly get their work
standardized now, they would have many problems doing so.
Since it wasn&#8217;t developed in a large
multi-vendor community, it will probably take years to really
vet it and fix the inevitable problems that creep in when you work
in isolation,
years it doesn&#8217;t have because
OpenDocument is already here and has <i>had</i> those years of experience
and vetting.
They could hire a bunch of people and do a pretend &#8220;independent&#8221; analysis
by many people all paid by the same vendor, but the results are not likely
to result in good work.
I doubt Microsoft will even get much interest in the
standards community; they already have a standard, so
there&#8217;s no need to do the work twice.
And that assumes Microsoft fixes its
licensing problems, which appears unlikely.
It can be done, but they&#8217;ve delayed entry into the standards process for
so long that it&#8217;s not clear if anyone cares about standardizing
on their format any more.
In particular, it&#8217;s hard to imagine other office suite vendors being
very interested, because they&#8217;ve already invested years in a perfectly
good standard.
Vendors will probably give Microsoft&#8217;s XML format a Monty Python-like
response --
<a href="http://www.redmonk.com/sogrady/archives/000732.html">
&#8220;It&#8217;s very nice-a, but we already got one.&#8221;</a>
And without participation from multiple vendors who <i>implement</i>
office suites, the standardization would just be viewed (correctly)
as a sham.

<p>
Microsoft can go ahead and use only
Microsoft XML, but since nobody else can read it (including many
current deployments of Office), and people are standardizing
on OpenDocument instead, customers may find that they just don&#8217;t want
the latest version of Office unless Microsoft hurries up and
implements the standard.
Strong pressure might cause abandonment of the latest version of
Microsoft Office, intead of getting people to switch to the product.

<p>
One major use for Microsoft&#8217;s XML format might be as a starting point
for a separate program that converts their format into OpenDocument.
If an office suite built that in, but uses licenses like the GPL that
Microsoft disapproves of, then Microsoft could exploit that
through its license and shut the office suite down.
But if it&#8217;s a separate program, it&#8217;s not clear what Microsoft would do.
They could shut down the converter, but that wouldn&#8217;t stop competitors, and
it would expose their licensing conditions as anti-competitive without
actually harming the office suite suppliers.
(Exposing conditions as anti-competitive makes sense from a business
perspective if you can drive your competitors out of business before the law
can do anything, but it makes no sense if it only exposes you to liability
without harming your competitors.)
If they do not shut down the converter, it could help people to
move away from Office even more rapidly.

<p>
I feel really sorry for people like
<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/brian_jones/">Microsoft&#8217;s Brian Jones</a>;
they&#8217;ve poured part of their lives into getting an XML format into
Microsoft Office, and tried to get it at least partly open.
Yet Microsoft&#8217;s decision-makers appear to have
shot themselves in the foot.
I doubt very much that people like Brian Jones made the legal decisions that
appear to have made Microsoft XML lose; he does not deserve
condemnation for those decisions.

<p>
But really, this needn&#8217;t hurt Microsoft at all.
Anyone can implement OpenDocument, so Microsoft
can easily add code to Microsoft Office so that
they fully support OpenDocument too.
It&#8217;s easy, but will they swallow their pride enough to make their
customers happy? I hope so.
Someone will do it; OpenOffice.org itself could be
used as a filter, if nothing else.
There are XML-to-XML tools (like XSLT) that should make it easy to do.
I suspect if Microsoft added good OpenDocument interfaces to
Office, a lot of people would buy it.
On the other hand, if people end up having
to use OpenOffice.org as a plug-in to use Microsoft Office, they may soon start
asking why they need Microsoft Office.
<p>
Microsoft can choose to do what it likes, but so can customers.
Customers want a completely open standard, and Microsoft has chosen
to not meet their customers&#8217; requirements. If Microsoft continues
to do so, then
Microsoft should expect to lose its customers; that&#8217;s how
the market works.
They can&#8217;t claim ignorance that their customers
want fully open standards;
governments have been asking for them for decades.
They know the rules, they just chose to ignore them.
<p>

<h1>But this Can&#8217;t Happen!</h1>
<p>
Actually, it can.  A market leader can find that it&#8217;s failed to
listen to its customers, and then either meet its customers&#8217; needs or
lose the market.
It&#8217;s happened many times before.
Microsoft decided to ignore the standards in this case, and so they&#8217;ll have to
play catch-up if they want to compete.
But they can do it, if they choose to, and they can harmed, if they
ignore their customers.
History even gives us some ready examples, so let&#8217;s look at them.
<p>
In the late 1980s
through 1995, Microsoft refused to accept the Internet TCP/IP (and later web)
standards, and tried to get everyone to use Microsoft&#8217;s proprietary networking
standards instead.
Even though everyone used Microsoft clients, the market rejected
Microsoft&#8217;s networking standards, and chose plug-ins or switched away from
Microsoft.
Microsoft suddenly realized that its customers were leaving, and that
they were about to be completely sidelined.  Around 1995 Gates commanded his
troops to do an about-face and rush to get TCP/IP and the WWW far better
supported.  It wasn&#8217;t pretty at the time, but in fairly short order they got at
least some things working to remain competitive.
Microsoft has been powerful for
a long time, but not omnipotent; when the market moves toward important
interoperability standards, Microsoft usually manages to support them
eventually, even if Microsoft had been trying to sell an alternative.
<p>
In fact, market leaders in this <i>particular</i>
market niche have been overrun before.
WordStar, Word Perfect, VisiCalc, Lotus 1-2-3, and dBase were all
market-dominating office software at one time, supported by companies who
had great incentive to stay as market leader.
Each one lost because they ignored their customers, through problems such
as ignoring the transition to 16-bit computing, to graphical user interfaces,
or the need for reliability.
Customers want to transition to a standard XML format
for office data that <i>anyone</i> can implement,
and are getting serious about it.
They are even more serious now, because this is a side-effect of massive
networking: with massive networking, everyone needs to be able to take
and extract different snippets of data, in novel ways, so they need a format
that is general enough to support it.
Microsoft hasn&#8217;t taken that seriously enough.

<p>
Obviously, having a lock on the current market is no guarantee of the future.
David Halberstam&#8217;s book &#8220;The Reckoning&#8221; gives another example from
carmaking:
&#8220;The US Big Three automakers thought that they could dictate what their
&#8216;captive&#8217; market could buy, but the US public proved that assumption
to be false, in the mid seventies. The only survivors from that era of heavy,
rear wheel drive land yachts (albeit in much reduced and much improved forms)
were the Ford Crown Victoria/ Mercury Grand Marquis and the Lincoln Town Car.
Every other passenger vehicle is some variation of the K-car.&#8221;

<p>
Can a group of suppliers overtake a big company? Sure.
Look at the videotape standards war of
VHS vs. Sony Betamax in the 1980&#8217;s.
Sony was a big company, trying to control
an industry through a format it created.
But the rest of the industry chose VHS, which allowed many different
suppliers (Sony tightly controlled who could implement Betamax, while
the VHS specification was far more open to implementation by others).
The group of VHS suppliers quickly competed with each other, while staying
true to the standard, customers preferred formats where there were
competing vendors, and as a group the VHS vendors demolished Betamax&#8217;s
market share.
There&#8217;s even a slang term based on this; &#8220;to betamax&#8221;
means &#8220;to deploy a proprietary technology format
that gets overwhelmed in the market by a format that allows
multiple competing manufacturers&#8221;.
There&#8217;s more to that story, of course, but my point is that being big
does not mean every product you make is accepted in the market.
The fact that there&#8217;s a slang term tells you something else:
occasionally suppliers try this stunt.
Large companies are often lured (by greed) into trying to completely
control a market and their customers via a proprietary format.
Often competitors (who fear being driven out of business) then
band together with customers (who fear having a sole supplier)
to develop and promote a standard that is not as proprietary.
Eventually the broadly-created standards tend to win, because
customers make the final decisions, and few customers want to be
controlled by a single vendor.
Having broad input into the standard&#8217;s development also helps make sure
that all important needs were addressed.
Microsoft is betamaxing in this case, 
and that&#8217;s too bad.

<p>
Microsoft even freely admits that customers do not want to be locked
into a single supplier for their office documents.
The problem is that Microsoft has been repeatedly claiming that
their format meets this requirement.
No independent evaluator believes Microsoft has met this requirement,
and in fact, several published reports have explained exactly why
Microsoft has not met this minimum bar.

<p>
Do official standards always win in the market?
Of course not!
Many standards have failed in the past because they didn&#8217;t have any
implementations, their implementations were poor, or because the
implementations were far more expensive than their competitors.
But no one pretends that any of these cases are true.
Even
<a href="http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/789019/000119312505174825/d10k.htm#tx69164_3">Microsoft&#8217;s Form 10-K report ending June 2005
admits that OpenOffice.org&#8217;s competition</a>, in particular, is now a risk
factor for them.
The main reason standards don&#8217;t win are not in evidence here.
But the
typical reasons for a market leader to fail are in full bloom, namely,
failing to meet
critical customer requirements and pushing a proprietary format against
an open standard widely supported by competitors and embraced by users.

<!--
VHS beat Betamax, and the Internet TCP/IP protocols beat
Microsoft's networking protocols, given the same circumstances.
-->

<p>
There&#8217;s no doubt that this will cost money.
Any transition -- even a minor transition to a new version of the same
product -- costs money.
But these are one-time costs, whereas staying where they are will cause
more data loss, and by telling everyone <i>now</i> where they are going they
can get everyone moving in the same direction (with more lead time,
the risks and costs go down).
Saugus, Massachusetts&#8217; website
<a href="http://www.saugus.net/Dailies/daily_2005-09-01_1653/">
Saugus.net</a>
suggests this transition may not be as difficult as some fear:
&#8220;It won&#8217;t affect most of the bigger Saugus web sites at all
(as Saugus.net has been supporting open formats generally since 1998
when the Saugus By-Laws were first made available, and newer Saugus School
sites like the TAHG project site are already building in support, too).&#8221;
Certainly this rollout will require planning, as with any IT policy, but
that&#8217;s why people get hired to manage IT infrastructures.


<h1>Bottom Line</h1>

<p>
At this time it appears that OpenDocument is the wisest and
lowest-risk long-term decision, even though at first blush it
seems surprising.
Any market leader has lots of advantages, but it appears that
Microsoft has far overplayed its hand here.

<p>
The old Microsoft Office format is unspecified and will cause
continuing data loss, and it fails to take advantage of XML technology.
Even Microsoft is abandoning it. Microsoft&#8217;s XML format will
prevent instead of help
interoperability; it simply fails to meet typical government requirements,
since its restrictive license prevents real competition and it
failed to enter the standardization process (as requested by Europe and others).
People will try to do what&#8217;s easy, but only if actually meets their
requirements.

<p>
By announcing their goal early, governments like
Massachusetts make it easier to achieve them, because that gives people time to
plan that transition, and suppliers more time to implement
the requirement.  It appears that many other governments (including
European governments) are coming to
the same conclusion, for all the same reasons.
Massachusetts has not rejected Microsoft Office, the program; they&#8217;ve
simply rejected Microsoft&#8217;s new XML format, and chosen the
international standard instead.
Even if Massachusetts backed down (always a possibility, especially since
sometimes technical decisions get trumped by good ol&#8217; boy networks), this
certainly suggests that other organizations will do the same.
In fact, this can&#8217;t help but move the eye to another battleground: Europe.

<p>
<a href="http://europa.eu.int/idabc/en/document/2592/5588">In 2004
Europe made its desires quite clear</a>. In particular,
they told Microsoft to consider &#8220;the merits of submitting XML formats
to an international standards body of their choice&#8221;
and issue &#8220;a public commitment to publish and provide
non-discriminatory access to future versions
of its WordML specifications&#8221;.
Europe also stated that where
&#8220;only a single revisable document format can be used, this
should be for a format around which there is industry consensus,
as demonstrated by the format&#8217;s adoption as a standard.&#8221;
Microsoft failed to take the hint, by avoiding standards and failing to
provide non-discriminatory action.
Microsoft could try to rush in at the last minute and catch up,
or customers could decide that they don&#8217;t need their requirements;
but every day that seems more doubtful.
Governments and now doing just what they said they&#8217;d do... they&#8217;re
choosing the standard, based on what meets their need.

<p>
I&#8217;m no Microsoft-basher, I even have friends there,
and I&#8217;ll freely praise good decisions they make.
But in this particular
case, I think they&#8217;ve made some poor decisions, and
the result was fairly predictable.
Predicting is hard, especially about the future (so it&#8217;s said), and
this isn&#8217;t as certain as the sun&#8217;s rising.
But things sure don&#8217;t look good for
Microsoft&#8217;s proprietary XML format right now.
Tacking the word &#8220;open&#8221; into the name doesn&#8217;t make it open,
and &#8217;royalty-free but not to all my competitors&#8216; is
simply not acceptable to people nowadays.
Even the Microsoft&#8217;s old binary office
formats didn&#8217;t have those kinds of onerous limitations!

<p>
I&#8217;m sure that there will be people who use Microsoft&#8217;s new format.
That&#8217;s not my point.
My point is that it&#8217;s clear that Microsoft&#8217;s format is unlikely to
dominate the future of office formats in the same way that their old
binary formats did, unless something dramatic happens.
The old binary formats for Word, Excel, etc., have become so common that
essentially <i>every</i> office suite must be able to read and write them.
But this ubiquity, without a specification and based on limited
binary formats, has become problematic.
These old formats are essentially unspecified, hard to process, and
depend far too much on low-level arbitrary structures of old versions
of Microsoft Office. Even Microsoft&#8217;s latest versions of Office
often fail to read this format, and as they update their programs, older
documents are increasingly likely to become unreadable.
Since even Microsoft can&#8217;t manage to read the older versions of the format, 
reliably, there&#8217;s clearly a fundamental flaw in the format.
Which is why there&#8217;s a need for a standard XML format.

<p>
<a href="http://blogs.zdnet.com/BTL/?p=1812">David Berlind of ZDNet has
a suspicion similar to mine:</a>
&#8220;My hunch is that there are plenty of government agencies,
both domestic and foreign watching this one and that,
in this game of chicken, Microsoft will not win.&#8221;

<p>
This won&#8217;t be hard for Microsoft to deal with, technically; they
can just add the code to support OpenDocument.
They already support RTF, ASCII, HTML, Word Perfect, and lots of
other formats.
(Yes, the HTML is very poor; it generally fails when validated by the
W3C validator, for example, and is excessively complex.
But the point is, they at least try.)
The real question is, can Microsoft swallow its pride to meet user needs...
or are they willing to risk their entire company in the hopes that
users don&#8217;t care about their own requirements?
Hopefully cooler heads will prevail, and Microsoft will simply
implement the only international standard.
It&#8217;s only one format, after all.

<p>
No doubt Microsoft will press on for a little while, and try to make
it so that &#8220;everyone accepts both&#8221;.
Except that everyone can&#8217;t accept both,
because their licensing still forbids it.
It really doesn&#8217;t make sense to have two formats for the same thing
anyway.
And if there can be only one format, customers want anyone to be able to
compete using that format, without any restrictions.

<p>
There&#8217;s no use in Microsoft
complaining that their proprietary format wasn&#8217;t chosen.
<a href="http://news.zdnet.co.uk/software/linuxunix/0,39020390,39216391,00.htm">
Microsoft claims that OpenDocument is specific to OpenOffice 2.0</a>,
but that&#8217;s ridiculous. <i>Many</i> programs implement OpenDocument,
in fact, KOffice was first.
In contrast, only one company currently implements
Microsoft&#8217; format.
Besides, there seems to be universal agreement that
Microsoft&#8217; format is specific to Microsoft, and Microsoft made
all decisions about the format.
The accusation appears far more appropriate to be raised against Microsoft XML.
Microsoft was told that
what users wanted was an internationally-standardized format usable by all,
without restriction.
For <i>years</i> they were told that.
Yet Microsoft was unwilling to provide what their customers demanded.
Now other (hungrier) suppliers have stepped up to meet the customer needs,
and the rest of the suppliers risk losing the market to the suppliers
who <i>do</i> want to meet customer needs.
That&#8217;s how the market works.
