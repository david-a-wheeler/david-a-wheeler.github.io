<h1 class="title">The Allsome Quantifier</h1>
<h2 class="author">David A. Wheeler</h2>

<i>
It is easy to mistranslate informal statements into formal logic,
and these errors can cause serious problems (potentially including
property damage, maiming, and loss of life).
For example, in formal logic,
&#8220;All Martians are green&#8221; would often be represented
as &forall;x&nbsp;(&phi;&rarr;&psi;),
while &#8220;All Martians are not green&#8221;
would often be represented
as &forall;x&nbsp;(&phi;&rarr;&not;&psi;).
In formal logic both statements are simultaneously true
if there are no Martians.
However, informal statements with this format often embed the assumption
that there is at least one case where the antecedent is true
(that is, that there is at least one Martian).
This essay proposes a new formal logic quantifier called
&#8220;allsome&#8221; (aka &#8220;all some&#8221;) that is designed
to make some of these mistranslations less likely.
The allsome quantifier, abbreviated &forall;!,
simultaneously expresses for all (&forall;)
and there exists (&exist;) in a way that models many informal
statements.
It has two syntactic forms, formally defined as follows:
&forall;!&nbsp;x&nbsp;(&phi;&rarr;&psi;) &equiv;
&forall;&nbsp;x&nbsp;(&phi;&rarr;&psi;)&nbsp;&and;&nbsp;&exist;&nbsp;x&nbsp;&phi;
and
&forall;!&nbsp;x&isin;A&nbsp;&phi; &equiv;
(&forall;&nbsp;x&isin;A&nbsp;&phi;)&nbsp;&and;&nbsp;&exist;&nbsp;x&nbsp;x&isin;A.
We have implemented this construct in the Metamath proof system and
formally proven that it counters this well-known problem.
We also compare this approach to alternative countermeasures in PVS and SPARK.
We hope that this new quantifier will
help reduce the risk of mistranslations of informal statements into
formal expressions, and that
others will eventually agree that allsome is awesome.

<p>
<h1 id="problem">The problem</h1>
<p>
Modern formal logic notation can represent many statements
with great precision.
This is very valuable, because formal logic can be verified by
computers to ensure that certain claims can be proven from other claims,
including those that can prevent loss of life.
Unfortunately, 
it is easy to mistranslate informal statements
into current formal logic notation,
resulting in &#8220;proofs&#8221; that in fact do not prove anything important.
That could be a disaster, because sometimes proofs are used to model systems
to ensure that they do not damage property, maim, or kill.
Even in pure mathematics we would like to ensure that what was proved is
what we <i>thought</i> was proved.
We should prefer notations that are unlikely to misunderstood,
yet today some common constructs are easy to get wrong.
This is especially true when material implication (&rarr;)
is combined with the for-all quantifier (&forall;).

<p>
This is perhaps best explained using an example.  The sentence
&#8220;All Martians are green&#8221; would typically be represented formally using the
expression &forall;<i>x</i>&nbsp;(&phi;&rarr;&psi;),
which means for all <i>x</i>, if &phi; is true then &psi; is true.
In this example expression &phi; is true
if and only if (iff) <i>x</i> is a Martian and
&psi; is true iff <i>x</i> is green.
Similarly, &#8220;All Martians are not green&#8221;
would typically be represented
as &forall;<i>x</i>&nbsp;(&phi;&rarr;&not;&psi;), that is,
for all <i>x</i>, if &phi; is true then &psi; is not true
(we will use the traditional symbols &not; for &#8220;not&#8221;,
&and; for &#8220;and&#8221;, and
&or; for &#8220;or&#8221;).

<p>
The problem happens if there are no Martians.
In formal logic, this can be represented as &not;&exist;<i>x</i>&nbsp;&phi;
(&#8220;it is not true that there exists an <i>x</i> that is a Martian&#8221;).
If there are no Martians, then
the statements &#8220;All Martians are green&#8221; <i>and</i>
&#8220;All Martians are not green&#8221; are <i>both true</i>.
That is
surprising to the inexperienced, because the two expressions seem to be
the opposite of each other.
The reason this occurs in formal (classical) logic is because
the implication (&phi;&rarr;&psi;) is equivalent to
&not;&phi;&nbsp;&or;&nbsp;&psi;.
When &phi; is always false,
&not;&phi; is always true, and an <i>or</i> with true is always true.
You can see a detailed formal proof of this in the Metamath proof of
<a href="http://us.metamath.org/mpeuni/alimp-surprise.html">alimp-surprise</a>,
and a proof of a similar problem at
<a href="http://us.metamath.org/mpeuni/empty-surprise.html">empty-surprise</a>.

<p>
In short: expressions that use for-all and
implication (such as &forall;<i>x</i>&nbsp;(&phi;&rarr;&psi;)) have
surprising results to non-experts
if the implication&#8217;s antecedent is never true.
This also affects expressions that use for-all and a variable that ranges
over a restricted set, since that is simply an abbreviation of a for-all
with implication.
Statements like this are sometimes called &#8220;vacuously true&#8221;
statements.

<p>
(Brief aside: We use Martians in our examples due to a vague sense of convention
and because at the time of this writing there are no known Martians.
If it is widely known that there are Martians in the time you are reading
this, use some other set that is not certain to be inhabited.)

<p>
<h1 id="solution">A solution: the allsome quantifier</h1>
<p>
In this author&#8217;s experience, the problem stems from a disconnect
between informal language and formal logic notation.
In informal language, when we say that all <i>X</i> is <i>Y</i>, there is often
an assumption that at least one <i>X</i> exists.
This goes back to at least [Aristotle], who expressly and intentionally
excluded empty sets from his logic system
[<a href="http://www.iep.utm.edu/aris-log/">Groarke</a>].
It is possible to state that something exists in modern formal logic notation,
in addition to saying that they all do it if they exist,
but in typical formal logic notation this requires using
two different quantifiers.
There is no way to simply express this common informal statement
in formal logic notation when using a single standard quantifier.
This lack of a simple way to formally represent a common kind of
informal statement can hide a lot of mischief.

<p>
Here we propose the &#8220;allsome&#8221;
(aka &#8220;all some&#8221;) quantifier,
a convenient shorthand that
combines the &#8220;for all&#8221; quantifier (&forall;)
with an &#8220;exists&#8221; quantifier (&exist;).
This new quantifier directly represents the common informal statement pattern
that simultaneously asserts that some assertion is true of all <i>X</i>s
<i>and</i> that there is at least one <i>X</i>.
We have chosen &#8220;&forall;!&#8221; as the allsome symbol,
with two syntactical patterns: a more general case that applies to
a top-level implication, and a shorthand case that is applied to all
members of a class.
Here are their formal definitions:

<ol>
<li>&forall;!&nbsp;<i>x</i>&nbsp;(&phi;&rarr;&psi;) &equiv;
&forall;<i>x</i>&nbsp;(&phi;&rarr;&psi;)&nbsp;&and;&nbsp;&exist;<i>x</i>&phi;
&nbsp;&nbsp;[<a href="http://us.metamath.org/mpeuni/df-alsi.html">df-alsi</a>]
<li>&forall;!&nbsp;<i>x</i>&isin;<i>A</i>&nbsp;&phi; &equiv;
(&forall;<i>x</i>&isin;<i>A</i>&nbsp;&phi;)&nbsp;&and;&nbsp;&exist;<i>x</i>&nbsp;<i>x</i>&isin;<i>A</i>
&nbsp;&nbsp;[<a href="http://us.metamath.org/mpeuni/df-alsc.html">df-alsc</a>]
</ol>

<p>
For example, if we now write &#8220;All Martians are green&#8221; as
&forall;!&nbsp;<i>x</i>&nbsp;(&phi;&rarr;&psi;),
we are simultaneously asserting that all Martians are green
<i>and</i> that there is at least one Martian, which is almost
certainly what the speaker actually meant.

<p>
The terminology and symbol are carefully chosen.
The term &#8220;allsome&#8221; was chosen because it&#8217;s short,
easy to say, and
clearly hints at the two concepts it combines (&forall; and &exist;).
The alternative &#8220;allexist&#8221; takes longer to say
(three syllables instead of two) and is also more challenging to say due to
the large sound shift between its vowels.
We chose the term &#8220;allsome&#8221; instead of
&#8220;someall&#8221; because we expect it to be used in cases where
the human is focusing on the notion of &#8220;all&#8221; - so it made
sense to emphasize that.
The symbol &forall;! was chosen since there is already a &exist;! symbol
that suggests that it is some variant of &exist;
(so there is precedence for combining an explanation mark with a quantifier).
In addition, this sequence when used as a symbol
does not require that a new Unicode character
be created and implemented before the symbol can be used.
It might be useful to create a new Unicode character for it in the future,
but it will be easier to make that argument once the symbol attains
broader use.

<p>
This new quantifier does not eliminate the traditional for all (&forall;)
quantifier, in fact, allsome is defined using for all.
Instead, this new quantifier makes it easier to express a common
circumstance, and perhaps more importantly, it reduces the risk of
dangerous misstatements (which could lead to property destruction,
maiming, or death if you are depending on the proofs to prevent that).

<p>
We have received a number of interesting comments from Yannick Moy;
one was that this &#8220;might be overkill in some occasions, because it&#8217;s
more difficult to prove than a simple &#8216;for all&#8217; quantification, and
it&#8217;s likely to be less automated because automatic provers are bad with
exhibiting witnesses.&#8221;
A &#8220;witness&#8221; is simply an example that shows that something exists.
We agree that sometimes automatic provers are bad at finding them today,
but we expect that they are going to get better at them over time.
Humans are usually pretty good about providing them, or at least identifying
an example that the prover can relatively easily prove, so we don&#8217;t
think this is such a big problem.
More importantly, if you care whether or not something is true, you
should specify
what you actually require; otherwise, the specification can be very misleading
(you may think you&#8217;re proving something you aren&#8217;t).
If you intend for something to exist, then you should specify it.

<p>
We have implemented the &#8220;allsome&#8221; quantifier in the
<a href="http://us.metamath.org/mpeuni/mmset.html">Metamath Proof Explorer</a>,
including some formal proofs about its properties, and it works
exactly as you would expect.
For example, we can prove that
&forall;!&nbsp;<i>x</i>&nbsp;(<i>x</i>&isin;<i>A</i>&rarr;&psi;)
&harr;
&forall;!&nbsp;<i>x</i>&isin;<i>A</i>&nbsp;&psi;
[<a href="http://us.metamath.org/mpeuni/alsconv.html">alsconv</a>].
Perhaps even more importantly, we can prove that the &#8220;surprise&#8221;
shown earlier cannot ever happen with allsome, specifically, we can prove that
&not;(&forall;!&nbsp;<i>x</i>&nbsp;(&phi;&rarr;&psi;) &and;
&forall;!&nbsp;<i>x</i>&nbsp;(&phi;&rarr;&not;&psi;))
[<a href="http://us.metamath.org/mpeuni/alsi-no-surprise.html">alsi-no-surprise</a>].
Thus, the &#8220;allsome&#8221; quantifier is already implemented and
has been rigorously proven to have the properties it was designed to have.

<h1 id="other-than-material-implication">Road rarely travelled: Dropping material implication</h1>
<p>
The problem stems from how the logic operation material implication (&rarr;)
sometimes differs from informal language.
It is possible to drop the normal logic operation called material implication,
but most people (including me) believe dropping material implication
would not be an improvement.

<p>
[Suber1997] notes that in English
there are &#8220;many kinds of implication...
the first step in becoming comfortable with material implication is to
realize that, precisely because it&#8217;s just one kind of implication, it
cannot capture every use of the English &#8216;if...then&#8217; or
&#8216;implies&#8217;...
Material implication sometimes violates our intuition, but
it is valuable because it creates a
&#8216;truth-functional kind of implication&#8217;
which brings many substantial benefits.&#8221;

<p>
This debate about the meaning of implication is an old debate.
Philo the Dialectician (who flourished around 300 BC)
was a dialectic Greek philosopher of the Megarian school.
(The Megarian school was a predecessor to and
influencer of later Stoic logic; Zeno, who founded Stoicism, was
a friend and admirer of Philo.)
Philo interpreted the conditional (&#8220;if... then&#8221;)
as material implication:
&#8220;the conditional is true when it does not begin with a true proposition
and finish with a false one, so that a conditional, according to him,
is true in three ways and false in one way.&#8221;
[Empiricus, 2.113].
Philo&#8217;s teacher, the Greek philosopher Diodorus (died c. 284BC),
disagreed with Philo.
Diodorus said that &#8220;a conditional is true which neither was nor is able to
begin with a true one and finish with a false one&#8221;.
Thus, a statement like
&#8220;If it is day, I am having a discussion&#8221; when it is day
would be true for Philo but
&#8220;false according to Diodorus. For it is able to begin with the true
&#8216;It is day&#8217;
and finish with the false &#8216;I am having a discussion&#8217;
(when I have become
quiet), and it was able to begin with a true one and finish with the false
&#8216;I am having a discussion.&#8217; &#8221;
[Empiricus, 2.115].
So even around 300 BC there was a debate about this,
and Sextus Empiricus could point to this disagreement as an
unresolved debate around the second century AD
[Empiricus, 2.113-2115].

<!--
"Against the Logicians" by Sextus Empiricus
TRANSLATED AND EDITED BY
RICHARD BETT

(From the Introduction by Bett):
"The two books Against the Logicians are part of a larger work by Sextus
Empiricus, the best known ancient Greek skeptic and the only one from
whom we possess complete texts, as opposed to fragments or second-hand
summaries.
...
The evidence suggests that he lived in the second century [AD], but
it is not clear that we can fix his dates with any more precision than that...

Described in outline, Sextus’ method is simply to subject to scrutiny
the views of the dogmatists in these areas. This means that, in addition
to his own criticisms and counter-arguments, Against the Logicians (like
most of Sextus’ works) contains a considerable amount of summary of
other people’s views. The most extensive case of this is the long historical
survey that makes up roughly the first half of the discussion of the
criterion of truth (1.46-260). Sextus describes all the earlier views that
might be thought to bear on this subject (even though the Hellenistic
term “criterion of truth” postdates most of the thinkers in question). As a
result, this passage is a mine of information about ideas that in many cases
are otherwise poorly recorded. But there are numerous other passages of
the same kind throughout both books. Outside the first half of Book , it
is the Stoics, always for Sextus the preeminent dogmatists, whose views
receive the most scrutiny, and therefore the most summary. This is particularly
true on technical logical matters, where the Stoics are almost the
only school represented; the most obvious exception is the views on the
truth-conditions for conditionals held by Philo and Diodorus (2.113-117,
cf. 265) – but even these are closely associated with the Stoics, since the
founder of Stoicism, Zeno of Citium, studied logic with them (Diogenes
Laertius 7.16, 25). It is striking that Aristotle and the Peripatetics, whose
formal logic was the main rival to that of the Stoics
(and was far more influential
beyond antiquity), are never mentioned in this context in Against the
Logicians. Nor, for that matter, does Aristotle’s theory of demonstration,
elaborated in the Posterior Analytics, receive any attention in the section
of Book 2 devoted to that subject. But these are just extreme cases of a
general phenomenon – namely, Sextus’ comparative lack of interest in
Aristotle’s philosophy and his heavy concentration on Stoicism. Again,
one fortunate by-product of this preference is that Sextus supplies many
details about Stoic philosophy that we would not otherwise have.
A cursory reading of Against the Logicians might leave one with the
impression that Sextus’ goal is to show that the dogmatists are wrong
about the issues addressed: for example, that there is no such thing as a
criterion of truth. But this would be a mistake. It is true that a great deal
of the argumentation takes the formof undermining the dogmatists’ pretensions
to knowing the answers in these areas. But Sextus several times
takes the trouble to make clear that his aim is something other than this
might suggest ... In keeping with what
was explained in the previous section, he intends to bring us to a position
of suspension of judgment on the topics in question, such as whether or
not there is a criterion of truth. This is to be accomplished by juxtaposing
the positive arguments of the dogmatists with the critical arguments supplied
by himself, resulting in a situation of “equal strength” (isostheneia)
between the opposing arguments. “Equal strength” is best understood as a
psychological notion; it is not that both or all of the opposing positions are
rationally justified to an equal degree (which would require endorsement
of theoretical notions that would themselves be objectionably dogmatic),
but simply that one is supposed to find them equally persuasive – in which
case, according to Sextus, suspension of judgment inevitably results.
"

QUOTE from "Against the Logicians" by Sextus Empiricus:

Descriptions of and difficulties surrounding non-simple propositions (108-
129) (108) Now that we have a feel (up to a point) for the dialecticians’
laying down of the law with respect to simple propositions, let us move
on to that of the non-simple ones. Now, non-simple propositions are
the ones mentioned above, which are constituted from a differentiated
proposition or from different propositions and in which a conjunction
or conjunctions prevail. (109) Out of these let us take for the present the
so-called conditional. This, then, is constituted from a differentiated
proposition or from different propositions by means of the conjunction “if
[ei]” or “if indeed [eiper].” For instance, from a differentiated proposition
and the conjunction “if,” a proposition like this is constituted: “If it is
day, it is day”; (110) and from different propositions and the conjunction
“if indeed,” we get one of this character: “If indeed it is day, it is light.”
Of the propositions in the conditional, the one in the position after the
conjunction “if” or “if indeed” is called both “leader” and “first,” and
the other one “finisher” and “second,” even if the whole conditional
is expressed the other way round, like this: “It is light, if indeed it is
day.” For in this case, too, “It is light” is called “finisher” although it
was expressed first, and “It is day” is called “leader” although it is spoken
second, because of being in the position after the conjunction “if indeed.”
(111) In concise terms, then, the composition of the conditional is like
this, and a proposition of this kind seems to promise that the second one
within it follows from the first one within it, and that if the leader is so,
the finisher will be so. Hence, if such a promise is kept, and the finisher
follows from the leader, the conditional becomes true; but if it is not
kept, it is false. (112) And so, starting from this, let us look at whether
any conditional can be found that is true and that keeps the promise just
mentioned.
All the dialecticians in common say that a conditional is sound when
its finisher follows from its leader. But on the question of when it follows,
and how, they disagree with one another and lay out competing criteria of
following. (113) Philo, for example, said that the conditional is true when
it does not begin with a true proposition and finish with a false one, so
that a conditional, according to him, is true in three ways and false in one
way. For when it begins with a true one and finishes with a true one, it
is true, as in “If it is day, it is light.” And when it begins with a false one
and finishes with a false one, it is again true – for example, “If the earth
flies, the earth has wings.” (114) In the same way, too, the conditional that
begins with a false one and finishes with a true one is true, such as “If the
earth flies, the earth is.” But it is false only when it begins with a true one
and finishes with a false one, as does “If it is day, it is night.” For when
it is day, “It is day” is true, while “It is night,” which was the finisher, is
false. (115) Diodorus, on the other hand, says that a conditional is true
which neither was nor is able to begin with a true one and finish with a
false one – which conflicts with Philo’s position. For a conditional such
as “If it is day, I am having a discussion,” when it is day at present, and I
am having a discussion, is true according to Philo, since it begins with the
true “It is day” and finishes with the true “I am having a discussion,” but
false according to Diodorus. For it is able to begin with the true “It is day”
and finish with the false “I am having a discussion” (when I have become
quiet), and it was able to begin with a true one and finish with the false “I
am having a discussion.” (116) For before I began having a discussion, it
began with the true “It is day” and finished with the false “I am having
a discussion.” Again, one of this character – “If it is night, I am having
a discussion” – when it is day and I am silent, is in the same way true
according to Philo (for it begins with a false one and finishes with a false
one), but false according to Diodorus. For it it is able to begin with a true
one and finish with a false one, when night has come, and when, further,
I amnot having a discussion but am quiet. (117) But in addition, “If it is
night, it is day,” when it is day, is true according to Philo for this reason:
that it begins with the false “It is night” and finishes with the true “It is
day”; whereas according to Diodorus it is false for this reason: that it is
able, when night takes over, to begin with the true “It is night” and finish
with the false “It is day.”
(118) Since there is this kind of opposition, then – to speak by way of
example – among the criteria for the conditional proposition, it may be
that the distinguishing of the sound conditional is intractable. In order for
us to learn this, the dispute among the dialecticians about its soundness
needs first of all to be decided on. And to the extent that that is not decided
on, it too is bound to remain in suspension of judgment. (119) And this
makes sense. For either we will pay attention to all the dialecticians’ criteria
or to one of them. But it is not possible to pay attention to all of them.
For they conflict, as I have shown in the case of the two spoken of before,
and things that are in conflict cannot be equally trustworthy. But if we pay
attention to one of them, we will pay attention to it either all by itself and
without judgment, or with reasoning that shows that this kind of criterion
is sound. (120) And if we assent to some criterion without judgment and
all by itself, why will we assent to this one rather than that one? And this
amounts to assenting to none of them, because of the conflict. But if it is
with reasoning that shows that the criterion of the conditional accepted
by us is sound, this reasoning either is inconclusive and non-terminating
or conclusive and terminating. (121) But if it is inconclusive and
non-terminating, it is untrustworthy and bad for preferring some criterion
of the conditional. But if it is conclusive, it is surely conclusive for
this reason, that the consequence follows from the premises, so that it is
itself certified through a certain following. (122) But the following that
was sought from the beginning in the case of the conditional should have
been certified by reasoning. This, therefore, amounts to falling into the
reciprocal mode. For in order for us to learn about the conditional, which
needs to be certified as a result of its following, we have to resort to some
reasoning, and in order for this reasoning to be sound, its following, from
which it is judged that it is sound, has to have been previously confirmed.
(123) If, then – at least on the basis of this kind of impasse – we do not
have the sound conditional, nor will we have conclusive reasoning. But
if we do not have this, nor will we have demonstration; for demonstration
is conclusive reasoning. But if demonstration is not real, dogmatic
philosophy is done away with.

<p>
Some logicians have been disturbed by material implication, so
they &#8220;have developed so-called &#8216;relevance logics&#8217; in which the
antecedent and consequent of conditionals must somehow bear on the
same subject.&#8221;
However, while interesting, relevance logic has not widely caught on.
As Suber notes,
&#8220;(1) The perversity of material implication is deliberate, for it is the
only way to get truth-functionality. (2) But the perversity violates
only our ordinary expectations, not any logical principles. (3) For
material implication, despite its perversity, suffices to capture the
logically essential core of meaning in ordinary uses of implication.
The nuances of English that it does not translate do not affect validity
(in standard logic). (4) Hence, the price is worth paying, for the
counter-intuitive material implication distorts nothing essential and,
because it is truth-functional, allows us to test the validity of
arguments that contain implication statements.&#8221;
He also notes that in English there are &#8220;many kinds of implication...
[so] no other specific version of implication can [express
English statements precisely] either.&#8221;

<p>
There has been work to define and model causality
(as opposed to material implication).
This work is important in the real world, but also complex.
The book <a
href="https://www.cs.cornell.edu/home/halpern/papers/causalitybook-ch1-3.html"
><i>Actual Causality</i> [Halpern 2016]</a>
discusses (real-world) actual causality and proposes a family of definitions
for actual causality.
It is interesting, but the fact that it takes a whole book to deal with it
suggests that there are good reasons mathematicians would choose something else.

<p>
As [Edgington] notes,
&#8220;The truth-functional theory of the conditional was integral to Frege&#8217;s
new logic (1879).
It was taken up enthusiastically by Russell (who
called it &#8220;material implication&#8221;), Wittgenstein in the Tractatus, and
the logical positivists, and it is now found in every logic text.
It is the first theory of conditionals which students encounter.
Typically, it does not strike students as obviously correct.
It is logic&#8217;s first surprise.
Yet, as the textbooks testify, it does a creditable job in
many circumstances.
And it has many defenders.
It is a strikingly simple
theory: &#8220;If A, B&#8221; is false when A is true and B is false.
In all other cases, &#8220;If A, B&#8221; is true.&#8221;

<p>
Thus, I don&#8217;t think we should drop material implication.
Instead, we should try to find one or more ways to keep material implication
while making it less likely to be misused.

<h1 id="alternatives">Alternative Solutions</h1>

<p>
Of course, we are not the first to notice this problem.
Here we note two alternative approaches to counter this problem
while retaining material implication.

<h2 id="pvs">PVS TYPE+</h2>
<p>
Prototype Verification System (PVS) was developed
for the development and analysis of formal specifications, and
it has special abbreviations to declare non-empty types.
An uninterpreted type or subtype declarations introduced with the keyword TYPE
may be empty, while an
uninterpreted type declarations introduced with the keyword NONEMPTY TYPE or
simply TYPE+ are assumed to be nonempty.
Uninterpreted subtype declarations introduced with the keyword NONEMPTY TYPE
or TYPE+ are assumed to be nonempty, as long as the supertype is nonempty.
This means that simply adding + after the word TYPE eliminates possibility
of that type being empty.
For more information, see
<a href="http://pvs.csl.sri.com/doc/pvs-language-reference.pdf"
>[Owre&nbsp;2001]</a> section 3.1.5.
<p>
However, this PVS mechanism <i>only</i> works for that specific type, and if an
expression does not use such a type for its antecedent, this approach
does not help.
So while it can deal with a few narrow situations, it is not as
general an approach as allsome.

If the type T is empty, then the following two equivalences hold:

<h2 id="spark">SPARK dead branch warning</h2>

<p>
<a href="https://www.adacore.com/about-spark">SPARK</a> is a
programming language, verification toolset, and a design method which
together &#8220;ensure that ultra-low defect software can be deployed in
application domains where high-reliability must be assured, for example
where safety and security are key requirements&#8221;.
This is especially useful in embedded systems where performance is critical.
<a href="https://learn.adacore.com/courses/intro-to-spark/index.html"
>Intro to SPARK</a> is an interactive introduction to it.
SPARK makes it possible to mathematically prove that a program
will do certain things given certain assumptions.
Of course, if the specification is wrong, then what it proves won&#8217;t
be what was intended.

<p>
In 2018
SPARK implemented a warning that can often detect that a
&#8220;branch&#8221; in a logical formula is &#8220;dead&#8221; - including when an implication
in a for-all has an antecedent can never occur.
This warning (when enabled) is implemented by calling SMT provers
to detect the potential problem; they are given a 1 second timeout
and only report when they can prove that that there is a dead branch.

<p>
Yannick Moy developed and sent me a little specification in November 2018
that specifies the Martian propositions in SPARK
(see <a href="./martians.ads">martians.ads</a>).
As expected, when sent the Martian propositions SPARK can easily prove them:
<pre>
martians.ads:10:19: info: assertion proved
martians.ads:11:19: info: assertion proved
</pre>

<p>
However, when SPARK is given the switch
&#8220;--proof-warnings&#8221; to activate the warnings, SPARK also reports:
<pre>
martians.ads:10:66: warning: unreachable branch
martians.ads:11:66: warning: unreachable branch
</pre>

<p>
This warning mechanism has many advantages:
<ul>
<li>It works with existing quantifiers.
<li>It can detect other kinds of problems where something is unreachable.
<li>It technically has no false positives.
The warning &#8220;is only triggered if the prover can prove that a branch
is dead. So you&#8217;ll still get false positives in the sense that people
may not be interested in that specific warning (&#8220;OK it&#8217;s dead for that
configuration but not another one&#8221; for example), but it will always
point to an actual dead branch.&#8221; (Yannick Moy).
</ul>

<p>
However, it also has disadvantages:
<ul>
<li>There is no <i>guarantee</i> that it will report a problem.
The warning is only reported when it can guarantee that there is a dead
branch, and in more complex circumstance this may not be detected.
In short, there are no false positives (all reports are real), but there
can be false negatives (some problems might not be reported).
<li>Enabling these warnings takes a noticeable amount of time on larger
programs, and thus is not the default.
Yannick Moy reports,
&#8220;there is a price to pay for such a proof-based warning: calling a
prover. Right now we make this quite small, with 1 second timeout only
for these special calls, but this is still noticeable on large programs
with many branches to check (plus we already have in fact a few others
of these proof-based warnings, on preconditions or postconditions that
are always false and dead code after loops). This is why we&#8217;ve not made
it the default but a separate switch. The customer who asked for this
feature has made it the default configuration of the tool.&#8221;
<li>In general, the warning is not as powerful as allsome in cases where
allsome is useful - there is no guarantee that the warning will show in
dangerous cases, while allsome formally specifies that something must exist.
</ul>

<h2 id="together">Working together</h2>

<p>
There isn&#8217;t any need to pick just one approach or the other.
The allsome quantifier can provide guarantees for certain circumstances.
Techniques like the one used in PVS
can expressly state that certain types exist.
Warnings that try to detect common mistakes
(without guaranteeing their detection),
such as those that can be provided by SPARK,
can help detect problems in many other circumstances.
Countering defects requires a range of approaches, not any one;
all of these approaches can work together.

<h1 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h1>

<p>
Specification errors can be a serious problem, so we think that systems
should use a variety of mechanisms to reduce the likelihood of errors.
Those include providing notation that more closely maps to common informal
constructs and detecting constructs that are likely to be misstatements.

<p>
The new allsome quantifier does not eliminate all specification errors
by itself, but it does help counter one common kind of mistake by providing
notation that more directly represents a common informal construct.
We expect that the allsome quantifier would be part of a larger
suite of measures to counter common mistakes.
Here are some examples of other mistakes and ways they can be countered:

<ul>
<li>Another common kind of error is using implication directly within an
exists quantifier (the form &exist;&nbsp;<i>x</i>&nbsp;(&phi;&rarr;&psi;)).
This is almost always a mistake.
Usually the implication &rarr; should be
logical conjunction aka &#8220;and&#8221; aka &and;, so what was intended was
&exist;&nbsp;<i>x</i>&nbsp;(&phi;&and;&psi;).
In classical logic, (&phi;&rarr;&psi;)
is identical to (&not;&phi;&or;&psi;)
so that entire expression is another way to write
&exist;&nbsp;<i>x</i>&nbsp;(&not;&phi;&or;&psi;) ... an entirely
different expression.
Thankfully, this common error is much easier to detect.
Both Why3 and SPARK already have a built-in warning if there is
an implication used directly within an exists quantifier.
This check does not even need to be built-in;
a separate style checker could warn when this particular
combination (&exist; with &rarr;) occurs
since it is practically never intended.
<li>Paul E. Black noted that an implementation is typically checked
against a specification by proving that the implementation implies the
specification; this ensures that the implementation only has behaviors
allowed by the specification, but it does not require the
implementation to have any behavior at all.
He suggests that correctness statements have two parts,
corresponding to liveness and safety. Safety shows that the implementation
implies an &#8220;allowed-behavior&#8221; specification, while liveness shows that a
&#8220;required-behavior&#8221; specification implies the implementation.

<a href="https://hissa.nist.gov/~black/Papers/tphols99.html">[Black 1999]</a>.
</ul>

<p>
But again, the allsome quantifier does not need to solve all common mistakes.
Instead, we hope that the allsome quantifier would be part
of a larger suite of measures to counter common mistakes.

<p>
We hope that this new allsome quantifier will help
reduce the risk of creating formal expressions
that appear to be correct but in fact are mistranslations.
In addition,
we hope that others will eventually agree that allsome is awesome.
