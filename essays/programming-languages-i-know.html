<h1 class="title">Programming Languages I Know</h1>
<h2 class="author">David A. Wheeler</h2>

<p>
Here are programming languages I've learned or used (over 100!).
Today I tend to use a smaller set (typically Python, Ruby, C, and shell),
but I actually have learned many more.

I was proficient in (though I may be no longer), followed by ones I've
learned to some extent at some time though not as proficiently:

<p>
<a href="https://hmemcpy.com/2017/10/becoming-foolish/">"Becoming Foolish"</a>
explains why it's important to learn many programming languages:
"I was able to see things from a different perspective".
This point was also made in
<a href="https://vimeo.com/71278954">Bret Victorâ€™s amazing
"The Future of Programming" talk</a>.
In that talk
he pretended he was a software developer in 1973, but actually gave the talk
in 2013; I have no idea where he found a working overhead projector!
