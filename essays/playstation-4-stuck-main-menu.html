<h1 class="title">Playstation 4 (PS4) Stuck on Game Main Menus (cannot play any game) - How to Fix</h1>

<p>
Here's a potential problem:
you have a Sony Playstation 4 (PS4) and
you can move around the console menus, and select a game to start the
game main menu, but then cannot actually <i>play</i> the game
(you're stuck at the game main menu / game title screen /
"press X to play").
<p>
The solution that worked for me was to shut down the <i>controller</i>:
<ol>
<li>Get to the game main menu / title screen, where you are stuck
<li>Hold down for a few seconds the "PS" central button on the
DualShock Controller until you see a menu.
<li>Select "Sound/Devices" (move up/down with the direction buttoms and
press "X" to select)
<li>Go all the way down and select "Turn off device"
<li>Select "DUALSHOCK 4"; yes, you're intentionally turning off the
controller you're using!
<li>Press the "PS" button on the controller to turn it back on;
that will start the game.
</ol>
<p>
This involves some sort of subtle defect in the controller; 
I've tried another controller which didn't have this problem.
You should probably get the controller replaced if you can, but this
is a useful work-around.
<p>
Here are some other techniques you can try, but they didn't work for me:
<ul>
<li>Reboot game and/or console
<li>Press recessed "reset" button on back of controller
(you'll need a paperclip or similar)
<li>Connect the controller with USB, then
modify "settings" to disable Bluetooth connectivity (just use USB)
<li>Switch games
<li>Update game
<li>Hold down console power button for until you hear second beep (~7 seconds)
to go into safe mode; my contoller could not interact with the console in
safe mode.
</ul>
