<i>Save the software industry by posting obvious software ideas.</i>

<p>
Software patents have increasingly become a problem for
software developers.
Originally, the law wisely prevented software from being patented,
and this is still true in many countries.
However, recent U.S. court cases have changed this situation, and there's
now pressure for the EU and others to change their laws as well.
This is beginning to seriously impede innovation and progress
in software development.
More information about the problems of software patents can be found at the
<a href="http://progfree.org">League for Programming Freedom (LPF)</a>.
Indeed, there's even evidence that
<a href="http://www.thenewrepublic.com/docprint.mhtml?i=20021007&s=thompson100702">patents are stifling the pharmaceutical industry</a>.
<p>
One of the serious problems is that <b>obvious</b>
software techniques are being patented.
Software patent examiners have very little time to examine a patent, and
since they're paid less than those actually in the software industry,
they're less likely to be qualified to determine obviousness
to an ordinary software developer.
Even worse, I'm told that patent examiners are often subverted by their
bureacracy (i.e., even if they realize something is obvious, the
bureacracy may subvert their ruling).
<p>
After re-examining the U.S. law, I've realized that there's a partial
solution to the obviousness problem:
people should post publicly to the Internet, as much as possible,
various obvious ideas that come to them.
Make sure these ideas are distributed publicly, are stored for future use,
and can be found later (e.g., using Internet search engines).
I believe a public mailing list, say one for a relevant open source software
project, should be able to easily meet this
criteria, especially if it allows anyone to join, posts all
comments to a website, dates all postings,
and is designed so that normal Internet search engines can index it.
The website should be one that lasts, or at least is archived.
There are lots of mailing lists that meet all these criteria.
I'm <i>not</i> a lawyer, so I can't really offer this as legal advice,
but it seems to make sense.
<p>
I believe this approach should work because of U.S. law.
<a href="http://www4.law.cornell.edu/uscode/35/102.html">35 USC 102</a>
says a person can't apply for a patent if the idea was:
<ol>
<li> known or used by others in this country,
or patented or described in a printed publication in this
or a foreign country,
before the invention thereof by the applicant for patent, or
<li>patented or described in a printed publication in this
or a foreign country or in public use or on sale in this country,
more than one year prior to the date of
the application for patent in the United States,
<li>
invented by someone else, or
<li>
the invention was made in this country before by another who had not abandoned,
suppressed, or concealed it.
</ol>
<p>
So, once it's been published, only the person publishing the idea can
patent it, and they have only one year to apply for the patent.
Indeed, according to the first point, once it's ``known'' by others
(as documented by, say, a mailing list), no one else can patent it.
<p>
<a href="http://www4.law.cornell.edu/uscode/35/103.html">35 USC 103</a>
basically says that if something is obvious to an ordinary software
developer, it shouldn't be allowed a patent.
Its exact text is:
``A patent may not be obtained though the invention
is not identically disclosed or described as set forth in section 102
of this title, if the differences between the
subject matter sought to be patented and the prior art
are such that the subject matter as a whole would have
been obvious at the time the invention was made to a
person having ordinary skill in the art to which
said subject matter pertains.''
Sadly, while this should prevent patents of the obvious, it doesn't
really help.
<p>
Of course, the danger here is that a patent office might think that
only those things noted on the Internet are obvious.
That would be rediculous; clearly many things won't be
noted publicly <b>because</b> they are so obvious.
But the patent office is already failing to understand what's obvious,
and until the laws are fixed this seems to be a useful stopgap measure.
This doesn't really stop bad software patents on the things already
posted on mailing lists, because it's unlikely that a
patent examiner would know what to search for on the Internet.
But it gives <b>far</b> better ammunition in defending against a
foolish patent; when it can be shown that the same idea was circulating
publicly years before an application, at several different locations,
and had multiple people discussing it, it's hard to argue being first.
And hopefully, if software patents always fail in court,
this bad idea (whose time never came) will die sooner rather than
later.
