A related problem are ``submarine'' patents, that is, patents that
were granted many years ago, but the patent-holder quietly
permits or encourages the use of the patent by those who have no idea
that it's patented (preferably by sneakily incorporating it into
de facto or de jure standards).
Then, many years later (after the approach is depended on),
the patent holder suddenly enforces the patent.
This is rather easy to do, since there are so many frivolous patents
that a patent on something real is easily hidden, patents are notoriously
hard to read, and current law actively punishes those who read patents
(since anyone who reads patents can be punished more severely).

is supposed to protect users against submarine patents, but this
doesn't work well in practice.
For example, see the GIF patent fiasco with Unisys, or RAMBUS.
