There are a large number of Free-Libre / Open Source Software
(FLOSS) licenses, but only a few are widely used. The widely-used
licenses tend to be compatible, i.e., the software can be combined
to produce a larger work. The following &#8220;license
slide&#8221; figure makes it easy to see when common licenses
can be combined:</p>


<img width="709" height="283" src="floss-license-slide-image.png" alt="Floss license slide, showing connections from public domain to MIT, MIT to BSD-new, BSD-new to Apache and various versions of LGPL, LGPL to GPL, and GPL version 3 to Affero GPL version 3">

<br clear="left">
<p>
In this figure, the shaded boxes are the names of different FLOSS
licenses.  An arrow from box A to box B means that you <i>can</i> combine
software with these licenses; the combined result effectively has the
license of B, possibly with additions from A.  To see if software can
be combined, just start at their respective licenses, and find a common
box you can reach following the arrows (aka &#8220;following the slide&#8221;).
For example, Apache 2.0-licensed software and GPLv2+-licensed software
can both reach &#8220;GPLv3 or GPLv3+&#8221;,
so they can be combined using GPLv3
or GPLv3+.  This figure has been carefully crafted so following a path
determines if two licenses are compatible.  For more information you
must examine the license text, but this gives the basic answer quickly.

<p>At the left are the
&#8220;permissive&#8221; licenses, which permit
the software to become proprietary (i.e., not FLOSS). At the top
left is &#8220;Public Domain&#8221;, which
strictly speaking isn&#8217;t a license but in effect
it works like one.
Public domain (in the sense of copyright law)
means that there is no copyright on the work at all
(note that public domain in the sense of export control law is different and
not what we mean in this paper).
You can do <i>anything</i>
with public domain software (in the copyright sense), but it is rare;
the software must be explicitly released to the public domain
(some debate if that is possible in some jurisdictions) or be
created by a U.S. Government employee in their official
capacity. Next is the so-called
&#8220;MIT&#8221; or
&#8220;X11&#8221; license, which is very
permissive (you can do just about anything except sue the author).
Software under the MIT license is easily combined with the modern
3-clause Berkeley Software Distribution (BSD-new) license, which
compared to the MIT license adds a clause forbidding the use of the
author&#8217;s name to endorse or promote products
without permission (it&#8217;s debatable if this
clause actually does anything, since you typically have to have
such permission anyway). Finally we have the Apache version 2.0 license.</p>

<p>At the right are the
&#8220;strongly protective&#8221;
(&#8220;strong copyleft&#8221;) licenses, which
prevent the software from becoming proprietary. This includes the
most popular FLOSS license, the GNU General Public License (GPL).
The GPL has a version 2 (GPLv2) and 3 (GPLv3); a
&#8220;+&#8221; afterwards means
&#8220;version X or later&#8221;. GPLv2-only
cannot be combined with the network-protective Affero GPLv3, but
GPLv2+ (&#8220;version 2 or later&#8221;) can
via GPLv3.</p>

<p>
In the middle are the &#8220;weakly protective&#8221;
(&#8220;weak copyleft&#8221;)
licenses, a compromise between permissive and strongly protective
licenses.  These prevent the software component (often a software
library) from becoming proprietary, yet permit it to be part of a larger
proprietary program.
This figure shows the rules when you are making other software <i>part</i>
of the weakly protected component; there are other possibilities if
you are only using the component as a library.
The GNU Lesser General Public License
(LGPL) is the most popular weakly protective license, and has a version
2.1 (LGPLv2.1) and 3 (LGPLv3).  Note that LGPLv2.1 gives you permission to
relicense the code under any version of the GPL since GPLv2.  Another such
license is the Mozilla Public License 1.1 (MPL 1.1), but the MPL has
the serious drawback of being incompatible with the widely-popular GPL;
you can&#8217;t even use an MPL module in a larger GPL&#8217;ed program.
