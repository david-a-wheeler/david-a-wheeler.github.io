<h1 class="title">The Origin of All Men are Mortal</h1>
<h2 class="author">David A. Wheeler</h2>
<h2 class="date">2023-02-01 (original 2019-07-07)</h2>

<p>
Many books and articles use this as a standard example of logic:

<ul>
<li>All men are mortal.
<li>Socrates is a man.
<li>Therefore, Socrates is mortal.
</ul>

<p>
The question is: where did this example come from?

<h1>It does not come from Aristotle</h1>

<p>
Some people think this example comes from Aristotle, but
Aristotle did <i>not</i> say anything like this example.
Aristotle created the field of logic, because he was the first person
to study and write about logic independent of any particular argument.
So it is true that he discussed this <i>form</i> of argument.
But there is no evidence that Aristotle wrote this particular example.
Just look at
<a href="https://archive.org/details/AristotleOrganon"
><i>Aristotle Organon And Other Works</i> by Aristotle 
(translated under the editorship of W.D. Ross)</a>, which includes the
six books collectively called the <i>Organon</i> as well as <i>Rhetoric</i>.
Aristotle mentions Socrates often, as well as the terms mortal
and immortal, but he never uses them exactly this way
(you can verify this yourself by searching for "Socrates").

<h1>The Answer</h1>

<p>
The earliest document I can find with this specific example
is from 1843, specifically
<i>A System of Logic: Ratiocinative and Inductive, Presenting a Connected View of the Principles of Evidence and the Methods of Scientific Investigation</i>
by John Stuart Mill, 1843 (first edition), Book II Chapter 3 page 245.
On that page we see:
<p>
<quote>
When we say,<br>
All men are mortal<br>
Socrates is a man<br>
therefore<br>
Socrates is mortal ;<br>
...
</quote>

<p>
You can verify this via
<a href="http://www.logicmuseum.com/hypothetical/millonenumeration.htm">Logic
Museum</a> or the
<a href="https://archive.org/details/systemoflogicrat01millrich/page/n4"
>Internet Archive</a>.

<p>
Mill's <i>A System of Logic...</i>
went through a large number of revisions over many years.
For example, its 8th edition was released in 1872.
Unsurprisingly, these revisions moved material around,
For example, the 3rd edition
was published in 1851, and it first mentions the "Socrates is a man" example in
Book II, Chapter II, Of Ratiocination, or Syllogism, p. 190.
A discussion of Mill's writing of the original first edition, and
the changes it went through afterward, is contained in
<a href="https://oll.libertyfund.org/title/mill-the-collected-works-of-john-stuart-mill-volume-vii-a-system-of-logic-part-i#lf0223-07_head_009"
>The Collected Works of John Stuart Mill, Volume VII -
A System of Logic Part I</a>.
Since we are focused on its <i>first</i> use, and its first edition includes
the example, that appears to be its first full use.
This makes sense; this book was extremely popular in its time
(for its kind of work), as witnessed by its many editions.

<p>
If you find an earlier example,

>please let me know</a>.

<h1>What came before?</h1>

<p>
As I already noted,
Aristotle created the field of logic, because he was the first person
to study and write about logic independent of any particular argument.
You can see many of his works in
<a href="https://archive.org/details/AristotleOrganon"
><i>Aristotle Organon And Other Works</i> by Aristotle 
(translated under the editorship of W.D. Ross)</a>.
But nothing exactly like this is said.

<p>
Sextus Empiricus (c. 160 - c. 210 AD) made a different but
somewhat similar statement in
<i>Outlines of Pyrrhonism (Pyrrhōneioi hypotypōseis)</i>
(formatting is my own):

<ul>
<li>Socrates is human.
<li>Everything human is an animal.
<li>Therefore, Socrates is an animal.
</ul>

<p>
Note: It was tricky to verify that this proof of "Socrates is an animal"
was in the work of Sextus Empiricus.
On 2016-05-25 Mauro ALLEGRANZA reported on the
<a href="https://philosophy.stackexchange.com/questions/34461/all-men-are-mortal-socrates-is-a-man-therefore-socrates-is-mortal-original"
>Philosophy Stack Exchange</a> that this text was in
<i>Outlines of <b>Scepticism</b> (Pyrrhōneioi hypotypōseis)</i>, Book II, 164.
However, in the process of trying to verify statement,
I found there was a citation error.
The Greek title is fine, but the given translated English title is incorrect.
The English translation is actually
<i>Outlines of <b>Pyrrhonism</b></i>, not <i>Outlines of <b>Scepticism</b></i>.
Verifying the citation was made harder because the
<a href="https://philosophy.stackexchange.com/questions/34461/all-men-are-mortal-socrates-is-a-man-therefore-socrates-is-mortal-original"
>link originally provided</a> didn't work for me.
That said, this citation <i>was</i> enough of a clue for me to eventually
track down the correct citation.
Once I realized that I should start with the Greek title (not the incorrect
English translation), I successfully tracked down an English translation
to verify the claim.
Specifically I found
<a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=9WtiAAAAMAAJ"><i>Sextus Empiricus: Outlines of Pyrrhonism</i></a>,
Volume 273; Volume 291; Volume 311; Volume 382 of
the Loeb classical library Greek authors.
The author is Sextus Empiricus, of course.
The translation I used was translated by
Robert Gregg Bury, published by W. Heinemann, 1933,
with ISBN 0434992739 and ISBN 9780434992737.
Once I found the correct title, and searched this English translation available
online, I found the claimed text on page 257 of this translation.
So my thanks to Mauro ALLEGRANZA for helping me find this source.
Hopefully I have finished the job of correcting and verifying the citation.

<h1>What came after?</h1>

<p>
<i>The Love of Wisdom: An Introduction to Philosophy for Theologians</i>
by Andrew Davison (2013) page 48 discusses Aristotle’s works,
and says that “Perhaps the most famous example is the following”
with this example.
However, note that its wording does <i>not</i> imply that Aristotle directly
<i>said</i> this example.

<p>
<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2017/03/aristotle-computer/518697/"
>"How Aristotle Created the Computer" by Chris Dixon
(<i>The Atlantic</i>, 2017-03-20)</a>
says,
"Aristotle’s central observation was that arguments were valid or
not based on their logical structure, independent of the non-logical
words involved. The most famous argument schema he discussed is known
as the syllogism..." followed by that statement.
This text could be easily interpreted as claiming that Aristotle actually
used this example, but it doesn't exactly say that either.
It's true that Aristotle emphasized logical structure, and if that was
the intent it's correct.

<h1>Interpretation</h1>

<p>
It's worth noting that "man" in this context doesn't mean "male" but
simply "human".
As evidence, I point to
<a href="https://philarchive.org/rec/RUSOD">Bertrand Russell's "On Denoting" (in <i>Mind</i>, 1905)</a>.
This article clearly shows that
the phrase "All men are mortals" was interpreted as
"if <i>x</i> is human, [then] <i>x</i> is mortal is always true".

<h1>In Conclusion</h1>

<p>
This example was first published in 1843 in
<i>A System of Logic: Ratiocinative and Inductive, Presenting a Connected View of the Principles of Evidence and the Methods of Scientific Investigation</i>
by John Stuart Mill.
