The re-acceptance of (optional) static typing in dynamically-typed languages has been happening across the computing industry for the last few years.  Python (mypy), JavaScript (TypeScript), and Ruby (Sorbet) are all languages with dynamic typing that have had static typing added in some fashion.  It isn’t new; Common Lisp is also dynamic, but has optional static typing (its ANSI standard was in 1994).

Once again, too many people fail to apply simple engineering analyses to computer-related questions.  Static vs. dynamic types are a trade-off, and like any trade-off, there are good things to both sides:

* Non-static (dynamic) types mean you don’t have to declare types, so writing the initial code tends to be faster (you don’t have to figure out the types).  In many circumstances the *most* important factor is how long it takes to write the code, particularly in commercial settings where you’re a startup or trying to gain market share.
* Static types detect more errors, can lead to faster *execution*times, and can simplify dealing with larger programs.  IDEs can help more once they know the types of the text around them.

I wish more software developers thought in terms of “trade-offs” instead of “one true way”.  Then people could have reasonable discussions about how to best approach a given problem, instead of assuming their preferred answer works on all problems.
