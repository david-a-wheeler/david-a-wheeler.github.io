<p>
Some people may have trouble finding Eric Raymond's website.
If you're having that trouble, here's an explanation.
<p>
Around February 27, 2003, Eric Raymond's website suddenly moved from
"http://www.tuxedo.org/~esr" to
"<a href="http://www.catb.org/~esr">http://www.catb.org/~esr</a>".
Unusually, the ISP for tuxedo.org is not forwarding requests to the new site.

<p>
This means that widely-referenced material such as
<a href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar">The
Cathedral and the Bazaar (and related essays)</a>,
<a href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/jargon">The Jargon File</a>,
<a href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html">How to
Ask Smart Questions</a>,
<a href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/taoup">The Art of Unix Programming</a>,
the <a href="http://catb.org/~esr/fetchmail/">Fetchmail home page</a>,
and other such material have suddenly disappeared from the web.
Since most people currently link to the old site, instead of the new one,
and there are no forwarding links, people will run search engines
(such as Google) and think that Raymond's material is no longer on the Web!!
Raymond has asked Google to update their pages, to no avail.

<p>
It appears that there was some sort of dispute
between Eric Raymond and the owner of the tuxedo.org domain.
Early reports that I could find from external third parties suggested
very negative things about the tuxedo.org domain owner, and an early
version of this page quoted and referenced those reports.
I'm sorry about that; I did not intend to hurt anyone, I was simply
posting the best information I could find at the time.
I've since learned that there are two sides to this dispute, and
that creating this new domain is the resolution.
Rather than take sides, I'd like to simply see the relevant URLs updated.

<p>
Some pages, such as my <a href="https://dwheeler.com/oss_fs_why.html">Why
OSS/FS? Look at the Numbers!</a> paper and
Raymond's <a href="http://www.wikipedia.org">Wikipedia</a> entry have
already been changed, but far more pages refer to the invalid site.

<p>
So, I urge anyone who is linking to any of Raymond's material to quickly
update their links - just change "tuxedo.org/~esr" to "catb.org/~esr".

Here's a new posting for LWN:
<p>
Around February 27, 2003, Eric Raymond's website suddenly moved from
"http://www.tuxedo.org/~esr" to
"<a href="http://www.catb.org/~esr">http://www.catb.org/~esr</a>".

This means that widely-referenced material such as
<a href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar">The

have suddenly disappeared from the web.
It appears that there was some sort of dispute
between Eric Raymond and the owner of the tuxedo.org domain.
Early reports suggested very negative things about
the tuxedo.org domain owner, but after further investigation
LWN has learned that there are simply two sides to it, and that this
move resolves the dispute.
Anyone linking to Raymond's material should quickly change their links
from "tuxedo.org/~esr" to "catb.org/~esr".
