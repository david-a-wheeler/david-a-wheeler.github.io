You asked the wrong question.  You asked if something was "morally wrong",
instead of if it was "legal".  I do not make illegal copies of music,
because it's illegal.    But do not confuse something being fundamentally
immoral with whether it is illegal.

In most times and places, people freely copied music, stories, etc.,
without paying for "copyright".  This was condoned and accepted
by society.  So any notion that copying is "immoral" is a bias to
a particular time and place.  Did Homer get paid a per-copy royalty
for Illiad?  If not, was it immoral?  If not, why not?  Music, stories,
etc., are NOT physical goods. The very phrase "intellectual property"
is a lie, and causes faulty thinking like this.  These things are NOT
property - when you get a copy, I can still keep mine, a fact that is
fundamentally not possible with property.  These are "intellectual works",
not "intellectual property".

Over years we have developed a series of laws that gives temporary
monopolies of copying to people ("copyright holders"), so that they
can profit from creating the originals.  Historically this has been
a reasonable bargain; after a few years, the work was released to the
public domain, so others could build on it.

But over the last few decades, certain copyright holders have bribed
various politicians to constantly expand copyright, stealing the rights
of the public.  I would call this "piracy against the public" - theft
of the public's right to do what they wish with the results.  Then the
Internet came - making copying MUCH cheaper and easier.

The fundamental problem is that copyright is a balance of needs,
and that balance is now completely gone.  Historically, the public
has voluntarily given up its rights to copy fixed forms of expression
for a limited time.  In exchange, makers of copyrighted works can sell
copies, providing them the funding to make new works.  But the public
should only give up those rights for the minimum necessary to make new
works... which is now smaller, since new technology such as the Internet
makes it cheaper to make copies.  But instead, greedy organizations like
RIAA are trying to limit the public's rights further - by creating DRM,
extending copyrights indefinitely, and so on. The balance is gone.

This looks a lot like civil disobedience.   Not completely; I'm sure
that many have a thieving heart.  But many people who would return a
$100 bill are illegally copying 99cent songs.

I think copyright is overall a good system, and we should keep its general
structure.  But I also think that the balance is completely gone - no
one represents the users in Congress, or elsewhere.  We need to reduce
copyright to much shorter terms (say 28 years total), and include more
rights to consumers (e.g., the right to make arbitrary media transfers
to protect them from DRM).

If "big media" are unwilling to develop compromises with the public, then
eventually copyright will disappear as an effective approach entirely.

Copyright is not a moral issue, it's a pragmatic issue.  It's a compromise
between the public and makers of copyrighted works. If the public believes
it's getting a raw deal, it has every right to change the rules.
