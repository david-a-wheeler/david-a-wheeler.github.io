<b>Make Your Open Source Software GPL-Compatible. Or Else.</b><br>
<b>by <a href="https://dwheeler.com">David A. Wheeler</a></b>
<p>
This essay is a call to all those developers who are developing
<a href="http://www.opensource.org/osd.html">open source software</a> /
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html">Free Software</a>.
Developers:
Please, where possible, use an existing widely-used license for your software
that is known to be compatible with the
<a href="http://www.fsf.org/licenses/gpl.html">General Public License (GPL)</a>,
such as the
<a href="http://www.fsf.org/licenses/gpl.html">GPL</a>,
<a href="http://www.fsf.org/licenses/lgpl.html">LGPL</a>,
<a href="http://www.opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.html">MIT/X</a>, or
<a href="http://www.opensource.org/licenses/bsd-license.html">BSD-new</a>
licenses.
And, if you create your own license -
<a href="http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/opensources/book/perens.html">and
please try not to</a> -
make sure that your new license is compatible with the GPL.
You don't need to <i>use</i> the GPL -
not even the Free Software Foundation (FSF), the most avid GPL proponent,
claims that absolutely all software must be GPL-licensed
(e.g., see
<a href="http://lwn.net/2001/0301/a/rms-ov-license.php3">
Richard Stallman's comments on Ogg Vorbis</a>).
But make sure that your software's license is GPL-compatible, i.e., that
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq.html#WhatDoesCompatMean">
you can combine your code with code released under the GPL into
one larger program. 
</a>

<p>
Why?  The simple reason is that making your software GPL-compatible
ensures that you (and other developers) can reuse other GPL'ed software.
Even if you don't like the GPL yourself, many potential co-developers
do... and your project is more likely to be successful if you accommodate them.
Usually even avid GPL proponents will
<a href="http://www.fsf.org/licenses/license-list.html">
support software with other GPL-compatible licenses</a>.
But if your software isn't GPL-compatible, many OSS/FS developers
are likely to abandon your project and create a GPL-compatible version so
they can take advantage of GPL'ed code.
<p>
And there's a <i>lot</i> of GPL'ed code to take advantage of.
<a href="http://freshmeat.net/stats/">Freshmeat.net</a> keeps
statistics on licenses, and on
<a href="https://dwheeler.com/frozen/freshmeat.html">March 5, 2002</a>,
I found that 65.16% of the 19,882
software branches (packages) followed by Freshmeat are GPL-licensed
(the next two most popular were LGPL, 5.45%, and the BSD licenses, 5.18%).
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/softwaremap/trove_list.php?form_cat=14">The
same query examining Sourceforge.net supported projects</a> on
<a href="https://dwheeler.com/frozen/sourceforge_licenses.html">March 5, 2002</a>
found that the GPL accounted for 73% of the 22,489
``open source'' projects hosted on Sourceforge.net
(next most popular were the LGPL, 10%, and the BSD licenses, 7%).
In my paper
<a href="https://dwheeler.com/sloc"><i>More than a Gigabuck:
Estimating GNU/Linux's Size</i></a>,
I found that Red Hat Linux, one of the most popular GNU/Linux
distributions, had over 30 million physical source lines of code
in version 7.1, and that
<a href="https://dwheeler.com/sloc/redhat71-v1/summary">
50.36% of the lines of code were licensed solely under the GPL</a>
(the next most common were the MIT license, 8.28%, and the LGPL, 7.64%).
If you consider the lines that are dual licensed (licensed under both
the GPL and another license), the total lines of code under the GPL
accounts for 55.3% of the total.
<a href="http://savannah.gnu.org/docs/?item=How_is_the_registration_process.txt">Savannah</a> hosts 693 mostly-GPL projects (as of March 28, 2002) and
strongly encourages GPL-compatible licenses.
You ignore this amount of code and support at your project's peril.

<p>
Several high-profile projects have had to undergo painful
changes to make themselves GPL-compatible.
The widely-used
<a href="http://www.python.org/2.1/fsf.html">Python</a> language
and text editor
<a href="http://www.vim.org/announce/vim-6.1">vim</a>
recently underwent major license changes to become GPL-compatible.
<a href="http://www.mozilla.org/MPL/relicensing-faq.html">Mozilla</a>
is also undergoing a complex relicensing scheme, again, to resolve
perceived incompatibilities between their older licenses and the GPL.
While it's possible to relicense software to make it GPL-compatible, it's
quite difficult - you're much better off starting off GPL-compatible in
the first place.
Thankfully, many projects don't have to endure this transformation.
The W3C, for example,
<a href="http://www.w3.org/Status">explicitly states that
all its software releases are OSS/FS and are compatible
with the GPL</a> - showing that they believe GPL compatibility is
very important.

<p>
License analysis is complicated, and best left to lawyers.
The FSF developed the GPL and maintains a
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/license-list.html#GPLCompatibleLicenses">
list of licenses that it believes to be
compatible and not compatible with the GPL</a>.
My point isn't to debate their legal analysis;
I just want to show that determining GPL compatibility can be complicated.
Thus, the best approach is to keep things simple.

<p>
So, how do you make sure that your software is GPL-compatible?
Fortunately, this is easy.
One way, of course, is to use the GPL.
Another is to use a license that is known to be GPL-compatible, such as the
LGPL, MIT/X, and BSD-new (modified BSD) license
(but <a href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/bsd.html">
don't use the old/original BSD license, which had many practical problems</a>;
<a href="ftp://ftp.cs.berkeley.edu/pub/4bsd/README.Impt.License.Change">Berkeley
has switched to the new BSD license for their own software</a>).
A third alternative is to dual license the program: release it under
more than one license, one of which is the GPL,
and let the user pick which one they'll live under
(widely-used projects such as Perl and Mozilla do this).
If you're submitting changes to an existing project that uses
a GPL-incompatible license, include a note in your submission that
you're dual-licensing your changes with the GPL;
that will make it easier for the project to
dual-license the entire program later.
In any case, make sure that your OSS/FS software is GPL-compatible,
or your project may never have the support you wanted.
