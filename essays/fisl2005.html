<h1 class="title">David A. Wheeler&#8217;s Travelogue: the 6th International Free Software Conference (FISL 6.0) in Porto Alegre, Brazil</h1>
<h2 class="date">Revised as of 2005-08-25</h2>

<p>
In June 2005
I went to the 6&#176; F&#243;rum Internacional Software Livre (FISL) --
the 6th International Free Software Conference -- in Porto Alegre, Brazil.
It was great and worth the time.
Here&#8217;s a travelogue, which I hope you&#8217;ll enjoy.
This should give you a glimpse of what these conferences look like
from a speaker&#8217;s point-of-view.
I also jabber on about topics such as
<a href="#brazil_ossfs">Brazil&#8217;s relationship with open source
software / Free software (OSS/FS)</a>,
<a href="#whyoss_strong">why OSS/FS is so strong in Brazil</a>,
that <a href="#women">women have arrived</a>,
how the
<a href="#wordfree">word &#8220;free&#8221; in English is even <i>more</i>
confusing than people first realize</a>, some
<a href="#mypresentation">comments about my own presentation</a>,
and how I ended up trying to document
<a href="#javaimp">OSS/FS Java implementations</a>.


<h1>Monday-Tuesday, May 30-31, 2005</h1>

<!--
<a href="images/brazilian-money-big.jpg"><img src="images/brazilian-money.jpg" align="right" width="259" height="194"></a>
-->
<p>
I started flying Monday night at 9:40pm, managing to get a few
hours of highly interrupted and low quality sleep in the cattle section
of the plane.
This was a long flight -- about 10 hours --
going from Washington, DC, to Sao Paulo, Brazil.
The one highlight was that I sat with a very nice Brazilian lady,
who was returning to visit her elderly mother and had a lot of great
stories to share.
I arrived in Sao Paulo, Brazil, around 8am on Tuesday.
I couldn&#8217;t really go see Sao Paulo
(or I&#8217;d miss my connecting flight),
but I stepped out of the airport to at least get a glimpse.
I also dutifully exchanged my dollars for the local currency with the
airport thieves, I mean, money exchangers.
(Yes, other places have better rates, but it wasn&#8217;t clear I&#8217;d have
the opportunity before I needed some cash.)
<p>
At this point I was seriously toasted.
I had already stayed up til 3am on several nights to meet some other
deadlines, and only a week before I&#8217;d been in San Diego, California
(from which I was still recovering).
I was having seriously weird sensations from sleep deprivation.
In Sao Paulo I met the first person also going to FISL, in this case
Russ Nelson (we&#8217;d never physically met before).
I introduced myself to him, and about 20 seconds later I re-introduced
myself just as though the previous introduction hadn&#8217;t happened.
He graciously went through the motions; a minute later I realized
what had happened.
A <a href="matrix-party.html">Matrix</a>-type moment, very surreal.

<a href="images/collins-laughing-big.jpg"><img src="images/collins-laughing.jpg" align="right" width="154" height="103" alt="Scott Collins laughing"></a>
<p>
After some wandering around in the airport (airports aren&#8217;t
that exciting anywhere in the world), I went to the gate.
We were joined by
<a href="http://scottcollins.net/">Scott Collins</a>
(who works for TrollTech; he&#8217;s also had
a long history with Mozilla).
Scott is a riot in person; the picture I&#8217;m showing here is from later
in the conference, but the picture of his laugh here is a good illustration
of his general good nature.
Go ahead and click on the picture if you&#8217;d like;
most pictures on this travelogue can be expanded by clicking on them
(if you&#8217;re viewing this on-line).
<p>
All of us knew instinctively what most
travelers know: traveling in a herd is safer for everyone.
More fun, too.
And it&#8217;s not necessary to agree with every viewpoint of those
you travel with... in fact, I find learning different people&#8217;s
(reasoned) point of view very stimulating.

<img src="images/brazil-map.png" alt="Brazil [CIA World Factbook]" align="left" width="328" height="352">
<p>
A short flight (and a desparately needed on-plane nap) brought us
to Porto Alegre.

<p>
Brazil is a large country; it&#8217;s the fifth largest country in the world in both
area and population as of 2005.
It&#8217;s too bad I didn&#8217;t have time to see more of it.
Porto Alegre is in Rio Grande do Sul (R.S.), the southernmost
state of Brazil.
Since we were south of the equator, it was winter; it wasn&#8217;t really cold,
but this meant that daylight savings time was not in effect.
I knew that seasons reversed when you crossed the equator, but
I hadn&#8217;t realized its impact on daylight savings time for countries that
choose to use it.
This means that Brazil and the U.S. east coast
can be 1 or 3 hours different, depending on the time of year
(along with other alternatives if they don&#8217;t switch simultaneously).

<a href="images/market-big.jpg"><img src="images/market.jpg" align="right" width="154" height="103" alt="The marketplace"></a>
<p>
On arriving in Porto Alegre, we and others were picked up by the conference
organizers; I got to my hotel by around 2pm.
Unfortunately, almost everything closes at 5pm, so if I wanted to
see anything I needed to go right then.
I asked all of the speakers I could find if anyone wanted to go,
and I found a few willing (insane) people who were willing to go out
after depositing their worldly goods in their rooms.
Again, safety in numbers.
Till Kamppeter (LinuxPrinting.org), David Turner (FSF),
and Janet Cosey (FSF) were willing to play at being tourists, so
off we went.
We saw the Porto Alegre marketplace... all sorts of stuff to buy there,
including some cheap and tasty churros.
We also managed to find and see the cathedral.
On the sides of the cathedrals are South American symbols instead of the
gargoyles found on many European cathedrals...
I thought that was especially interesting.

<p>
We also found a restaurant.
Here&#8217;s what I quickly concluded about food in southern Brazil:
<ol>
<li>the food in Brazil is cheap (and good)
<li>the specialty is steak
<li>they&#8217;ll have to roll me back onto the plane.
</ol>

<a href="images/guarana-big.jpg"><img src="images/guarana.jpg" align="right" width="194" height="259" alt="guarana"></a>
<p>
I was also introduced to guaran&#225;,
a fruity carbonated drink that I&#8217;ve never seen in the U.S.
It&#8217;s <i>really good</i>; several locals specifically recommended the
Antarctica brand, but all of them were really good.
It&#8217;s sweet, but not as in-your-face sweet as Inca Cola is.
I&#8217;ve gotta get more of that stuff.
I brought back five cans of guaran&#225; as souvenirs to share,
and of all the booty I brought back, I think the
guaran&#225; was the most appreciated.

<p>
You learn stuff about people when you travel with them.
David &#8220;Novalis&#8221; Turner (FSF) looks like a software developer... and
surprise, surprise, he is.
But I also learned that both his parents are lawyers.
That probably gave him a head start, since he&#8217;s now very involved in
the GNU GPL Compliance Lab and other licensing/legal issues.
I believe there&#8217;s a strong similarity in many ways 
in how lawyers and software developers think; both fields work to gain
precision in language, and require thinking through a series of
consequences in a logical fashion.
James Grimmelmann has a series of articles that illustrates
some of the similarities between legal thinking and how
a software developer would think
(it&#8217;s called &#8220;Law School in a Nutshell&#8221; -- see
<a href="http://research.yale.edu/lawmeme/modules.php?name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=364">Part I</a>,
<a href="http://research.yale.edu/lawmeme/modules.php?name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=382">Part II</a>, and
<a href="http://research.yale.edu/lawmeme/modules.php?name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=396">Part III</a>).


<p>
I got back to the hotel and utterly collapsed.
I think some others got together, but my body needed a break.

<br clear="right">

<h1>Wednesday, June 1, 2005</h1>
<a href="images/banner-big.jpg"><img src="images/banner.jpg" align="right" width="154" height="103" alt="FISL banner"></a>
<p>
June 1 was the first day of the conference, labelled
a &#8220;community day&#8221;.
It started at 8:30am.
The conference had a booth area, though many booths were planning to open
starting June 2.
This was a multi-track conference; by 9am there were eleven simultaneous
presentations, plus the booth area, where people could go.

<p>
The conference was focused on
<a href="https://dwheeler.com/oss_fs_refs.html">
open source software / Free Software (OSS/FS)</a>, also called
FLOSS or FOSS in the U.S., and usually called
software livre in Portuguese.
OSS/FS programs are programs whose licenses give users
the freedom to run the program for any purpose,
to study and modify the program,
and to redistribute copies of either the original or modified program
(without having to pay royalties to previous developers).
As the Internet has risen to prominence, so has OSS/FS;
most websites depend on OSS/FS, including megasites like Amazon.com,
Yahoo!, and Google.
Some choose OSS/FS simply because in many cases it costs less.
Others choose it for other reasons, such as to gain these freedoms and
thus have more control over your own computer(s).

<p>
Many conference presentations were in Portuguese,
Brazil&#8217;s official language,
but there were a number of presentations given in English.
In addition, two rooms
always did simultaneous translations, so English was always
available in those two rooms
(either natively from the speaker or via translation).
I had worked to learn a little Portuguese before I flew down, using the
very impressive Pimsleur method, but it&#8217;s difficult to get a lot out of
a presentation when your knowledge is limited to phrases like
&#8220;Hello&#8221;, &#8220;Thank you&#8221;, and &#8220;I speak a little Portuguese&#8221;.

<a href="images/bigroom-big.jpg"><img src="images/bigroom.jpg" align="right" width="154" height="103" alt="The big room - empty - for 1,000 people"></a>
<p>
One of those two rooms was the &#8220;big room&#8221; (shown here).
The big room could hold 1,000 people.
The opening and closing ceremonies were held there, as were the talks
by Tso, myself, Collins, Raymond, and Maddog.

<p>
I had a short dinner with Eric Raymond, who had just come in after
a long and painful flight.
Eric tried to improve my Portuguese pronunciation, but this was
like teaching a pig to dance; you should be impressed that a performance
happens at all, and worry less about the quality of the results.

<a href="images/bruno-big.jpg"><img src="images/bruno.jpg" align="right" width="154" height="103" alt="Bruno"></a>
<a href="images/magnusson-topic-wielaard-big.jpeg"><img src="images/magnusson-topic-wielaard.jpeg" align="right" width="192" height="144" alt="Left-to-right Geir Magnusson (Apache Harmony and Geronimo), Dalibor Topi&#263; (Kaffe), Mark Wielaard (GNU Classpath)"></a>
<p>
Day one continued all the way with multiple tracks through
10pm (!).  Zounds.
As Peter Quinn noted to me later, both conference organizers and
participants had one heck of a work ethic.
And I stayed until 10pm, because several presentations were about
Java implementations.
People such as
Bruno Souza (president of SouJava, a Brazilian Java user group that
is a member of the Java Community Process),
Dalibor Topi&#263; (lead maintainer of Kaffe), Mark Wielaard
(lead for GNU Classpath, the leading OSS/FS Java core library implementation),
and Geir Magnusson (lead for Apache Harmony)
gave presentations.
Information about OSS/FS Java implementations is really hard to get --
particularly how all the pieces work together --
and the FISL conference had many of the main leaders, so I really
wanted to get the big picture.
I definitely got some information,
for example, Geir made the first public presentation
in the world about Apache Harmony.
But even after this day, I
didn&#8217;t get all the information I was looking for.
<a href="#javaimp">
As you&#8217;ll see, I eventually got that insight into
OSS/FS Java implementations</a>, but it took some effort...

<p>
One thing they did do was throw T-shirts out into the crowd,
a little practice that happened in other presentations too.
It certainly got the crowd&#8217;s interest, and it made the various
T-shirt catchers very happy.

<p>
I went to the hotel and collapsed, but I knew I couldn&#8217;t sleep in...

<h1>Thursday, June 2, 2005</h1>

<p>
There was an 8:30am presentation on Thursday about an interesting
security topic (on managing access control lists on distributed LDAP.
Well, it was interesting to me!).
I heard a few presentations after that, including
a presentation on an improved method for doing streaming media.

<p>
The presentation
&#8220;A comparison of Free Software [Development] Web Portals&#8221;
was of particular interest to me, because they compared
various sites that provide ready-made infrastructure for those who
develop OSS/FS.
These sites maintain mailing lists,
<a href="https://dwheeler.com/essays/scm.html">software configuration management programs</a>,
and other tools so that developers
who want to work together can concentrate on simply improving their project,
and let others maintain the infrastructure.
There were many pros and cons, but it became obvious why SourceForge
is still the most popular such portal.
SourceForge has far fewer restrictions
(it permits a broad range of licenses and has no topic limits),
it lets you keep your copyright, it works in English, and
it has lots of services -- though clearly there are cases where you might
go elsewhere.
One major limitation of this study
is that they didn&#8217;t have a real project to submit,
nor did they try to interview those who did.
Thus, they couldn&#8217;t evaluate &#8220;private&#8221; information
available only to
those with active projects.  I didn&#8217;t think that limitation was
necessary -- it wouldn&#8217;t have been that hard to start a small project,
or work with an existing project, to get the data they needed.
But their work was still interesting.


<h2><a name="brazil_ossfs">The Official Opening, and Brazil&#8217;s Relationship with OSS/FS</a></h2>
<a href="images/sea-of-people-big.jpg"><img src="images/sea-of-people.jpg" align="right" width="154" height="103" alt="Sea of people"></a>
<p>
The official conference opening presentation was held at 11:30.
This was an odd time,
since the conference had been going on for a day and a half.
But it was definitely interesting, because it showed how
the Brazilian government and industry leaders view
open source software / Free software (OSS/FS).

<a href="images/dignitaries-big.jpg"><img src="images/dignitaries.jpg" align="right" width="154" height="103" alt="Dignitaries #1"></a>
<a href="images/dignitaries2-big.jpg"><img src="images/dignitaries2.jpg" align="right" width="154" height="103" alt="Dignitaries #2"></a>
<p>
The government and industry leadership participation was amazing.
The opening ceremonies for FISL began with the Brazilian national anthem
(I&#8217;m not a citizen of Brazil, so
I simply stood respectfully as I would for any country).
Then the presentations began, which involved speeches by, or
the formal presentation of, the Vice-Mayor of the city of Porte Alegre,
the Vice-Governor and the Technology Secretary of
Rio Grande do Sul (R.S.),
a personal representative of the President of Brazil,
the president of the Social Security Information Technology (IT) company,
the president of the national IT company Serpro, and many other
dignitaries.

<p>
This impression of government and industry backing only accelerated
later in the conference.
In a lively debate on June 3, speakers included
a vice president of the First Bank of Brazil (Cerqueira Cesar),
the President of the national mail service (Dilberto Nerry Petry),
a vice-minister (?) of the planning ministry of the Brazilian
federal government (Marcelo de Carvalho Lopes),
the first secretary (vice minister) of science and technology
(Rog&#233;rio Santanna),
a member of the board of the Cobra IT company (Eduardo Armond), and so on,
and so on.

<p>
I&#8217;ve no doubt mangled many titles and names,
but that&#8217;s not the point.
The point is that Brazilian government and industry views OSS/FS
quite differently from most in the United States.
For many Brazilians, OSS/FS was essentially an opportunity to regain
national sovereignty or company control
over their own infrastructure, instead of allowing an
external company (and a foreign one at that) to maintain total
control and visibility over their internal infrastructure.
There also appeared to be significant concerns about transparency as
a reason why OSS/FS was so strongly preferred --
one speaker said something like
&#8220;Governments need to know what happens in their
networks, so they need to audit their code,
so it [must?] be public source.&#8221;
This reminded me of the text in a
<a href="http://odfi.org/archives/2003_05.html">
proposed law in Peru introduced by
Peruvian Congressman Edgar Villanueva Nunez</a>;
one of its principles was
&#8220;To guarantee national security it is vital to have systems
hat are devoid of elements that allow remote control or the
ransmission of non-desired information to third-parties.
herefore, it is required to have systems whose source code
s freely accessible to the public, so that its inspection be
llowed by the State, the citizens and a great number
of freelance experts in the world.&#8221;

<!-- Way more info at: http://odfi.org/archives/2003_05.html -->


<p>
Three of the Brazilian federal government ministries
each had their own large-scale booths at the conference.
Each seemed emphasize their own (different) role, and how they
used OSS/FS to further their ministry&#8217;s objectives.
And all seemed well-attended.

<p>
This is no recent event.
Back in 2000, the
<a href="http://www.businessweek.com/technology/content/oct2001/tc20011025_8523.htm">
Rio Grande do Sul state government
passed a law that in some cases required government agencies
to use &#8220;software livre.&#8221;</a>
On June 2, 2003,
<a href="http://www.pclinuxonline.com/article.php?sid=6879">
the Brazilian government announced plans to migrate
from Windows to Linux in 80% of all computers in state institutions
and state-owned businesses</a>
(as a gradual 3-year migration).
<a href="http://software.newsforge.com/article.pl?sid=05/05/05/1956215">
Others have noticed this Brazilian surge in use of OSS/FS, too.</a>
Some have reported that there&#8217;s some sort of firm government-wide
mandate to use only OSS/FS.
As far as I can tell, that&#8217;s not true, but OSS/FS is clearly widespread.
For example, I went to the university facilities people on Friday
to get a printout of my presentation.
This was a different group than the conference organizers, and I
noticed that the computer they used for general-purpose tasks like this
was <i>not</i> running Windows... it was running some Linux distribution.

<p>
One speaker discussed his experience with Monsanto and their seeds.
He stated that GMO&#8217;d seeds (of which one company owns 90% of the patents)
creates domination by a single company and a monoculture.
He then compared that situation to information technology and to OSS/FS.
There were a number of formal signatures and ceremonies;
there was a formal recognition of SouJava (a Brazilian Java group that
now is officially part of the Java Community Process, allowing it to
represent OSS/FS projects for certification).
There was also a release of a network management program as OSS/FS,
which a note that this was just the first of a series to
&#8220;decrease cost and improve functionality of IT.&#8221;

<p>
Every country is different, and I find it fascinating to see such
differences in mindset and approach at work.


<h2>FLOSS in Massachusetts</h2>
<p>
Yes, I went all the way to Brazil to hear about OSS/FS in Massachusetts.
But this wasn&#8217;t just any talk, this was a presentation by
Peter Quinn, Chief Information Officer (CIO) of the Commonwealth
of Massachusetts.
And again, it was interesting to hear different perspectives.

<p>
Quinn struck me as pragmatic, results-oriented person, and those are
great traits to have in a CIO.
He noted the problems of scale:
if Massachusetts were a company, it would be the 60th largest company
in the U.S. with 200 business units and an IT budget of $600 million.
That sounds like a lot of money, but when you spread it across their many
tasks, it&#8217;s difficult to do everything.
He had a number of concerns, including preserving history,
having data stored in formats accessible to all and ones that are
not technically restricted.
Indeed, he was concerned that the U.S. civil war would be better documented
than anything in the last ten years.

<p>
All too often, government leaders just declare a plan without
first examining what the needs are.
Instead, Quinn made sure that
he found out what his IT users were actually doing with their computers, first.
And what his support people found was interesting:
it turns out that only a very small percentage even <i>generate</i>
documents, so for most of them, an office suite to create documents
isn&#8217;t necessary.
Instead, what they needed was a web browser, email, and calendar.
In general, people tended to use only a few applications (the ones they
needed for their job), and &#8220;most people are readers, not writers&#8221;.

<p>
<a href="http://www.lancementsuse.ca/tiki-index.php?">
An updated version of Quinn&#8217;s presentation is available from the
June 16, 2005 Government CIO Leadership Summit in Ottawa, Ontario.</a>

<h2>Fried Phish and Spam</h2>
<p>
Eric Allman, developer of Sendmail, spoke on dealing with spam.
He&#8217;s someone worth listening to on this topic -- Sendmail is
the world&#8217;s most popular mail transfer program, so if
you use email, you (indirectly) use his work all the time.
<p>
He noted that there are two main email authentication methods
(that can work with unknown senders):
address/path-based systems (like SPF and Microsoft&#8217;s Sender-ID),
and cryptographic signature based systems.
There had been an effort to merge SPF and Sender-ID, but Microsoft insisted
on patenting Sender-ID, so everyone else threw away Sender-ID
and is using SPF instead if they want an address-based system.
In the cryptographic signature world there has been Yahoo&#8217;s DomainKeys and
Cisco&#8217;s Identified Internet mail -- Allman announced that the two are
now working to merge them into a single standard, &#8220;Domain Key
Identified Mail&#8221; (DKIM).
<p>
But authentication is only useful if you can gauge the reputation of the
sender, since spammers can sign their email too.
There are lots of challenges here, and he discussed various options.

<h2>Stunts</h2>
<a href="images/mono-stunt-big.jpg"><img src="images/mono-stunt.jpg" align="left" width="154" height="103" alt="Mono stunt"></a>
<a href="images/another-stunt-big.jpg"><img src="images/another-stunt.jpg" align="right" width="103" height="154" alt="Another stunt"></a>
<p>
In an over-4,000 person conference it can be hard to
get your message across... so a number of stunts were
pulled off throughout the conference for people to get
their message across.
You can see pictures here of a few.
If nothing else, they were fun.

<br clear="left">
<br clear="right">
<br>
<a href="images/tchau-woody1-big.jpg"><img src="images/tchau-woody1.jpg" align="left" width="230" height="154" alt="Tchau Woody #1"></a>
<a href="images/tchau-woody2-big.jpg"><img src="images/tchau-woody2.jpg" align="right" width="230" height="154" alt="Tchau Woody #2"></a>
<p>
Probably one of the nicest
stunts was the &#8220;Goodbye Woody&#8221; party held at
the Debian booth.
Debian is a notoriously conservative distribution, and it was
starting to get to be a joke that their &#8220;stable&#8221; distribution
was more like an &#8220;antique&#8221; distribution
(their caution makes some sense for servers,
but it makes no sense for clients).
Debian has finally cleared all their internal checks, and planned to release
as the conference closed.
Thus, they had a &#8220;goodbye Woody&#8221; party
complete with party hats, etc., that
was very well received by everyone.


<h2>Booths</h2>
<a href="images/serpro-big.jpg"><img src="images/serpro.jpg" align="right" width="154" height="103" alt="Serpro"></a>
<a href="images/ibm-big.jpg"><img src="images/ibm.jpg" align="right" width="230" height="154" alt="IBM"></a>
<p>
Most conferences like this have lots of booths, and FISL did too.
You had the usual large company booths, such as from IBM, Sun, and Unisys.
As I noted earlier, several government ministries had large booths related
to OSS/FS, which <i>was</i> unusual.
There were a few booths dedicated to pitching to visitors, e.g., outreach
to tourists and a local bar&#8217;s pitch.
<p>
You had the usual large number of small businesses, too.
There were lots of interesting vendors,
most of them selling various kinds of service or consulting arrangements.
For example, I talked with <a href="http://www.solis.coop.br">Solis</a>,
a small business that specializes in support for
libraries and universities; I thought they were particularly interesting.
Lots of companies did general consulting and support, and seemed to be
doing fine at it.
Two of the main questions people ask about OSS/FS is
&#8220;how can you make money at OSS/FS?&#8221; and &#8220;how do I get support?&#8221;,
not realizing that perhaps those two questions are connected.

<p>
OSS/FS conferences often have lots of non-profit organizations /
consortias that maintain projects of various kinds.
This conference had a large number of them, such as
OpenOffice.org.br (a Brazilian OpenOffice.org group),
Debian, LinuxChix, and so on.

<p>
I had several interesting conversations with the OpenOffice.org.br group,
including several with the person who heads the translation effort to make sure
that the OpenOffice.org office suite has a complete (and high-quality)
localization to Brazilian Portuguese.
I asked him what font he&#8217;d recommend for maximum portability between
Linux and Windows when using OpenOffice.org; he didn&#8217;t know, but he did
try to find out.
I&#8217;ve since learned that the
<a href="http://avi.alkalay.net/linux/docs/font-howto/Font.html">Bitstream Vera fonts</a> are specially recommended in this case, since
all OpenOffice.org installations include them.
That&#8217;s no doubt because
<a href="http://www.gnome.org/fonts/">they have a generous license
yet are high quality</a>; basically anyone can install them at any time.
If you exchange between OpenOffice.org and Microsoft Office,
you may be best off using the Windows fonts in your documents,
because most Windows users only have those fonts and may not understand
how to install other fonts (like Bitstream Vera).
It&#8217;s really important to make sure that the fonts in your documents are
installed on the computer you&#8217;re using, especially for presentations.
OpenOffice.org imports and exports many documents to Microsoft Office
quite well now, but if the fonts are not installed on the &#8220;other&#8221; system
you might not realize it.
That&#8217;s not limited to OpenOffice.org; fonts are important for any document
exchange, especially in documents like presentations where placement matters.

<p>
He had some absolutely beautiful glossy handouts made by Itaipu.
Itaipu is a massive multinational construction project, and they&#8217;ve
standardized on OpenOffice.org as their office suite.
They train all their IT workers on OpenOffice.org, and after the training
hand out &#8220;cheat sheets&#8221; (one each for
the word processor, spreadsheet, and presentation portions of the program).
The cheat sheets help remind people how to use the program, and
were stunningly beautiful: multi-color, glossy finish, clear text and
graphics... and on the front covers, a really funny Tux the penguin
wearing a construction hat.
Itaipu had their own booth, and had a Tux the penguin
dressed in a hard hat and carrying a chimarr&#227;o;
obviously that required a picture :-).

<h2><a name="women">Women Have Arrived!</a></h2>
<p>
I noted in my <a href="fosdem2002.html">FOSDEM 2002 travelogue</a>
that FOSDEM felt electric, but I was also disturbed at how few women were
involved in the FOSDEM conference.
The lack of female involvement in information technology (IT)
and in technology in general has been noted for many years;
in many ways OSS/FS is just yet another example of that.

<p>
But FISL was quite different in that respect.
There were a significantly larger number of women, both as speakers
and as attendees.
There were also a number of presentations throughout the conference on
how to increase the involvement of women even further.
(On August 25, 2005, Sulamita Garcia sent me an email confirming this --
in Brazil, they have managed to grow female participation
from just a few people to about 20% of the conference attendees and LUG users.
That's far more participation than many other countries see.)

<a href="images/nextgen-linuxchix-big.jpg"><img src="images/nextgen-linuxchix.jpg" align="right" width="154" height="103" alt="Next generation Linux Chix"></a>
<p>
I visited the LinuxChix booth to see what I could learn about all this --
certainly they were a visible element!
I talked with one of the LinuxChix there; it wasn&#8217;t easy because of
language barriers
(I don&#8217;t really speak Portuguese; she didn&#8217;t speak French and her
English was not so great, though better than my Portuguese).
Still, she clearly conveyed that earlier this year there had been a
separate conference on increasing the involvement of women in computing.
It was clear that the LinuxChix were working hard to show women
that there were other women in computing.
The LinuxChix booth was plastered with biographies of famous women
in computing (such as Admiral Grace Murray Hopper),
and one day they all wore the same fun outfit to identify themselves.
It looked like they were having a lot of fun -- and that whatever
was happening was working.

<p>
This also fits into other efforts to increase female involvement in
IT in general, or OSS/FS in particular.
And just after the conference ended, a
<a href="http://www.srcf.ucam.org/~hmw26/join-the-dots/2005/06/07/gnome-women/">
new group named GNOME Women accounced their formation</a>,
saying that they were inspired
by &#8220;the success of the
<a href="http://www.debianwomen.org/">Debian Women Project</a>&#8221;.

<p>
Some told me that this massive (by comparison) participation
of women in Brazil is largely due to
<a href="http://mulheres.softwarelivre.org/">PSL-Mulheres</a>
(Projecto Software Livre-Mulheres, or Free Software Project-Women;
PSL-Mulheres is a collateral project of PSL-Brasil). So I added that
remark to this travelogue, because I wanted to give credit where credit
was due.
But after I added this information to my travelogue,
I got a heated response that the
credit for Brazil&#8217;s amazing results really goes to
<a href="http://www.linuxchix.org.br/">LinuxChix BR</a>;
one email (sent to me on 2005-07-10) specifically noted
Sulamita Garcia (of LinuxChix BR) as being especially effective and key
to this.
I think it's clear that LinuxChix BR has been an incredibly
important part of this, so I certainly want to give them credit!
Indeed, there has been a lot of hard work by a lot of people.
I don't pretend to understand exactly who did what,
so I'll simply congratulate all those who have worked so hard to produce
such marvelous results.
Congratulations!

<p>
So the big question is: how did this occur?
Why are so many women involved in Brazil, when this is still
relatively rare in many other countries?
I don&#8217;t know, and since I wasn&#8217;t there
and I don&#8217;t speak Portuguese,
I&#8217;m the wrong person to try to find out.
I suspect that the story is a complex one, involving many different
people and different organizations (including LinuxChix BR and PSL-Mulheres).
Some information currently available that might help is
<a href="http://www.linuxchix.org.br/node.php?id=193">
Sulamita Garcia (toskinha)'s interesting
historical account, from her perspective in LinuxChix BR.</a>

<p>
But this is a travelogue, not a detailed social analysis.
I will not try to answer these (important) questions... because
I don't have those answers.

<p>
I really hope that people will look over what is going in Brazil.
I want to know <i>why</i> the Brazilians have
achieved such remarkable success.
What worked, and how could it be repeated elsewhere?
The problem of poor female participation in IT and OSS/FS is widespread.
Somehow, the Brazilians are overcoming it;
Brazil could easily become a model for the rest of the world to follow.

<h2><a name="wordfree">Free is a Confusing Word</a></h2>
<p>
The Free Software Foundation (FSF) has consistently used the term
&#8220;Free Software&#8221;, where they mean &#8220;Free as in Freedom&#8221;.
By their definition,
users of &#8220;free software&#8221; are free to view the program
(e.g., to do a security analysis or to learn from it), free to modify the
program to suit their needs,
and free to
redistribute the program (modified or original) to whoever they wish.
But the term &#8220;free&#8221; has other meanings, in particular, &#8220;no cost&#8221; (&#8220;gratis&#8221;).
This &#8220;libre&#8221; vs.  &#8220;gratis&#8221; distinction, missing
in the English word free, causes no end of confusion.
<p>
In discussions with others it was revealed that the word free
actually has <i>many</i> common meanings, not just libre and gratis:
<ol>
<li>Free as in freedom (&#8220;libre&#8221;) -- i.e.,
free of control by another.
The term &#8220;free market&#8221; can be viewed as a special case of this meaning, or
possibly having its own meaning.
<li>Free as in no cost (&#8220;gratis&#8221;).
<li>Free as in worthless.
<li>Free as in poor quality (&#8220;cheap&#8221;); you can argue this is variant of &#8220;worthless&#8221;.
<li>Free as in without (&#8220;guaran&#225; is free of alcohol&#8221;).
</ol>
<p>
A quick look at a dictionary finds a whole raft of definitions for the
word free, in fact.
<p>
Ouch.  English really is a crazy language.

<h2>Evening</h2>
<p>
I went out with Peter Quinn and
several others to dinner (I wish I&#8217;d written down their names).
We went to a little all-you-could-eat restaurant where they kept arriving
with interesting food.
I have no idea what most of it was, but it tasted great.
We then went to a nearby bar, where others were supposed to be.
I discovered an important rule in Brazil: do <i>not</i> lose the
little tickets they give you when you enter; it&#8217;s how they keep track
of what you drank, and it may cost you about a hundred U.S. dollars if
you lose the ticket.
No, I didn&#8217;t lose the ticket, but I didn&#8217;t realize til later how
important it was to not lose the ticket.
<p>
I was still tired, so I bowed out early.
I understand from others that not only is Quinn smart, he&#8217;s a good
dancer; I missed that part.

Like most conferences, FISL had a speakers&#8217; lounge.
I didn&#8217;t even visit it until Friday, because I wanted people (speakers or not)
to come up to me and talk with me if they wanted to.
But it was nice to have a spot without several thousand people milling about,
especially if you&#8217;re working on final touches for a presentation.
It was also nice to chat with the other speakers.


<br clear="left">
<br clear="right">

<h2>Before my talk</h2>
<p>
There was a lengthy debate/discussion on June 3 about the future
of OSS/FS in Brazil.
It had 21 people on the panel (yikes, that&#8217;s a overly big group).
It was scheduled for two hours, but took three.
I didn&#8217;t attend that particular panel,
but others who did told me it was really interesting;
the big trouble was that they just hadn&#8217;t given the people enough time,
so it went <i>way</i> over time (delaying my talk).

<a href="images/tso-big.jpg"><img src="images/tso.jpg" align="right" width="154" height="103" alt="Tso"></a>
<p>
Ted Tso spoke just before me about Linux filesystems.
His talk made it very clear why ext3 is so popular among the
many filesystems available for Linux.
SGI&#8217;s filesystem is very good, but with a big catch: You <i>must</i> have
an uninterruptable power supply to trust it.
It turns out that on x86s, when the power goes out, memory is the first
to stop working and disks are one of the last, so if a disk is writing
when the power goes out the disk will end up having random data scribbled
all over it.
SGI, when they built their own systems, modified their hardware to handle
this; commodity x86s don&#8217;t have such hardware, so filesystem
implementations must be designed to handle this case if they&#8217;re to be
used on commodity hardware.
The Reiser filesystem has lots of good properties (especially if you
have many small files), but there are some risks if you have a corrupted
filesystem and you want to recover it; its recovery tools can get
very confused.
IBM&#8217;s filesystem is very good, but it&#8217;s large and rarely used; the Linux
filesystem developers are slowly copying some of the good things in that
filesystem over to ext3.
For many, ext3 just works, and it works well.

<h2><a name="mypresentation">My presentation: Why OSS/FS? Look at the Numbers!</a></h2>
<a href="images/wheeler-introduction-big.jpg"><img src="images/wheeler-introduction.jpg" align="right" width="154" height="103" alt="Wheeler introduction"></a>

<p>
Then we had my talk &#8220;Why OSS/FS? Look at the Numbers!&#8221;.
This was, of course, was the best talk ever given on the planet :-).
I had flown all the way to Brazil to give this talk, so I had backups
galore to make sure I could actually give it:
a separate laptop with the presentation, a USB stick, various formats,
and if all else failed I had a paper printout I could use as notes.

<p>
My talk was, as you might guess from the title,
a summary of some of the many quantitative studies about OSS/FS.
My goal was quite straightforward:
showing that OSS/FS is worth considering when you&#8217;re getting software.
I didn&#8217;t expect that to be a hard sell to this crowd, but they will still
meet others who are unaware of OSS/FS, and would thus want to know them.
Many people who are familiar with OSS/FS are still not aware of the many
studies available about them.

<p>
But how did I end up knowing this in the first place?
That&#8217;s an interesting tale.
My &#8220;real job&#8221; is giving good advice about information technology,
particularly relating to computer security...
not by guessing or blathering opinions, but by doing serious research
to find the evidence and then analyze that to develop conclusions.
Naturally, I need to try to be aware of (and anticipate)
information technology trends.
Many years ago I noticed that &#8220;free software&#8221; / &#8220;open source software&#8221;
seemed to be becoming more common and popular, and that its rise
seemed to be correlated with the expansion of access to the Internet.
Many of its proponents made ethical claims, which I can&#8217;t really measure.
But many were also making intriguing claims that I <i>could</i> measure,
like claims about reliability, security, and so on.
So, I investigated... and while you certainly can&#8217;t show that OSS/FS is
<i>always</i> better, it turned out that there was a lot of quantitative
evidence that OSS/FS <i>could</i> produce excellent results.
But it took a while to investigate, in part because
not even its staunchest advocates seemed to know of any specific results
they could point to.
So once I found the data (on my own time!), it seemed appropriate to
post my collection so that others could get it.
At first, this was a short collection; now it borders on the
encyclopediac.

<p>
As should be clear from my writings, I do <i>not</i> argue that
OSS/FS is &#8220;always better&#8221; or other such statements.
In fact, I don&#8217;t think that statement is true.
But there are still places where
OSS/FS is not even considered as an option when people get software;
sometimes this is even due to the unintended consequences of other policies.
And that&#8217;s really sad.

<p>
I&#8217;ve given the presentation before, but it&#8217;s been a while.
I will post my presentation soon.
You can also see <a href="https://dwheeler.com/oss_fs_why.html">my
full paper, &#8220;Why OSS/FS? Look at the Numbers!&#8221;</a>
One person told me that he&#8217;d come to the conference <i>just</i> to
hear my talk (thanks!), and
Russ Nelson of OSI said he&#8217;d never heard of many of the
studies that I had.
Which is really the point of my effort.
It&#8217;s amazing that there&#8217;s so much research on this topic, yet in the
past it&#8217;s been so hard to find.

<p>
Going to FISL gave me a reason to update my presentation, and I think
many people just want the &#8220;short form&#8221; not the &#8220;all studies&#8221; version.
So I&#8217;m going to make the presentation that &#8220;short version&#8221;, and hopefully
by making it shorter many people will be willing to translate it.
In fact, I want to try to get as many translations of that presentation
as I can... if you know another (human) language, and that translation
isn&#8217;t available yet, please let me know.

<p>
Conferences are great for meeting other people.
Since I&#8217;d shown that I was interested in quantitative studies,
one person handed me a very nice report,
&#8220;O Impacto do Software Livre e de C&#243;digo Aberto
na Ind&#250;stria de Software do Brasil&#8221;.
Well, I assume it&#8217;s a nice report, it&#8217;s all glossy and stuff.
It&#8217;d be even nicer if I could read Portuguese.
But this is less of a barrier than it used to be;
Babblefish is very useful in translating things so I can
get a sense of it.
They&#8217;ll release an English version in August 2005,
which will be even easier for me to read.

<h2>Presentations afterward</h2>

<a href="images/collins-speaking-big.jpg"><img src="images/collins-speaking.jpg" align="right" width="103" height="154" alt="Collins speaking"></a>
<p>
Scott Collins followed, and he gave a great talk about building
user interfaces that work.
I&#8217;m a big fan of teaching developers how to create good user interfaces,
because I&#8217;ll have to use the interfaces they create.
The problem has some similarities to the problem of
<a href="https://dwheeler.com/secure-programs">teaching developers
how to write secure programs</a>, too.
He gave a great presentation -- lively, interesting, and worthy points.
<p>
For example, many people (including me) have often recommended that
developers divide their
programs into an &#8220;engine&#8221; and the GUI,
and then make sure that the engine is scriptable.
I recommended this because this division makes it easy to
create larger programs (by having a direct programming interface),
and because it makes revamping the GUI much simpler.
Collins noted the first point, but noted another good reason
I had not: Creating a separate scriptable engine
forces developers to think about the &#8220;language&#8221; used by their application.
For example, what are the key objects, operations on them,
and their interrelationships?
The GIMP bitmap drawing tool has key contructs such as &#8220;layers&#8221;;
the emacs text editor has key contructs such as &#8220;buffers&#8221;.
Thinking carefully so that you create a consistent &#8220;language&#8221;
results in a much more consistent user interface.

<p>
Oh, a warning to the English pedants:
You may have noticed in the paragraph above (and elsewhere)
that I don&#8217;t put the punctuation marks inside quotation marks.
That&#8217;s intentional.
When I can, I choose to use
<a href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/jargon/html/writing-style.html">logical
style quoting</a>
(as defined by Hart&#8217;s Rules and
the Oxford Dictionary for Writers and Editors).
The logical quoting system only places
quotation marks around what&#8217;s actually being quoted...
and <i>nothing else</i>.
This system is widely used in the U.K. and many other places,
though only it&#8217;s only now coming into significant use
in the United States.
The manual of style for the largest English encyclopedia,
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:MOS#Quotation_marks">Wikipedia</a>,
recommends the use of logical quoting.
The traditional U.S. quoting system is horrific for
anything related to computing, because adding punctuation often
completely changes the meaning.
For example, in the popular program vi,
&#8220;dd&#8221; deletes one line and
&#8220;dd.&#8221; deletes two.
Perhaps even more importantly,
placing punctuation inside a quotation
inserts intentions into other people&#8217;s mouths, and that&#8217;s
inappropriate; in a quotation, what&#8217;s quoted should be what was said.
And finally, it just doesn&#8217;t make any sense.
I believe
clarity is more important than tradition or a few typesetters&#8217; doubtful
fiats about looking &#8220;pretty&#8221;.
Beauty must take second place to truth.

<p>
After the presentations ended, the speakers were treated by the conference
organizers to a night at Churrascaria Roda de Carreta
(Av. Ipiranga, 5200, if you want to go there).
All you can eat food, with lots of steak, and with
&#8220;M&#250;sica e dan&#231;a ga&#250;cha&#8221;.
We were treated with some demonstrations of
traditional dances of men and women together, a 4-man dance
involving swords, and a demonstration of skill with a pair of
swinging balls (each at the end of a string).
Pablo&#8217;s girlfriend and Maddog both got their hair mussed with these
swinging balls.
Maddog in particular was pressed forward by everyone; he&#8217;s widely
loved and respected.

<p>
Many of us found out that two of the conference organizers eating
with us were newlyweds... as in married ten days earlier.
That&#8217;s extreme dedication, coming in to work on organizing a conference
right after your wedding.
We did shoo them off so they wouldn&#8217;t see us all the time.
But I do have to credit and commend the incredible dedication of
all the people who organized and ran the conference... it was really
incredible.

<p>
At the restaurant I got my picture taken with 
a chimarr&#227;o, a traditional southern Brazil tea that uses a
traditional straw and wooden container.
No, it really isn&#8217;t a bong.
In fact, I didn&#8217;t even get any tea at this restaurant -- this
was a complete fake just to take a picture.
The picture also shows me in a traditional southern Brazil hat and scarf.
&#8220;Traditional&#8221;, when applied to &#8220;hat and scarf&#8221;,
is another term for &#8220;silly-looking&#8221; -- at least when I wear them.
A local later came to my rescue and actually let me try the tea, but
we&#8217;ll come that story in a moment.

<p>
I also got a chance to meet
<a href="http://people.softwarelivre.org/~fernanda/index.php?module=home_page2">
Fernanda G. Weiden</a>, who was fascinating in
her own right.  She&#8217;s 23 years old (as of this writing) and
lives in Sao Paulo, Brazil... and is already doing amazing things.
(The picture shown here of her is actually from the Sunday party.)
She&#8217;s one of the founders of Projeto Software Livre Mulheres, which
appears to have had a tremendous impact on the presence of women in OSS/FS
in Brazil.
She&#8217;s a contributor to Debian (maintaining some packages), and is thus
also listed among the
<a href="http://www.debianwomen.org/">Debian women</a>.
She&#8217;s also working to spearhead the establishment of the
<a href="http://www.fsfla.org/">Free Software Foundation - Latin America
organization</a>.
She works at IBM (at the Linux Technology Center,
an Open Source development lab); I also got to
meet some of the people who work for her, and they seemed to
think well of their boss.
Obviously, she&#8217;s a leader.
Yet she&#8217;s also quite humble and charming in person.
I was glad I got to meet and talk with her;
I think we&#8217;ll be hearing a lot more about her.

<p>
When I returned from the hotel I found Eric Raymond coding in the
hotel&#8217;s common area on a GPS driver.
When he&#8217;s done, his driver
will automatically detect which of many GPS
receivers have been connected, if any, and then
configure everything without needing any user input at all.
(This is more than Windows does, which usually requires manual
installation and confirmation of a driver.)
Auto-configuring everything is a good idea, but I challenged him with
a new idea: what about automatically setting the timezone to the correct
value as you change location, if you have a GPS receiver?
He liked the idea, but unfortunately he didn&#8217;t find any highly accurate
maps that would reliably translate location into timezone (including
daylight savings time value).
If you know of any such maps, let him know.

<h2>Eric Raymond</h2>

<a href="images/raymond-presentation-big.jpg"><img src="images/raymond-presentation.jpg" align="right" width="154" height="103" alt="Raymond presentation"></a>

<p>
Eric did his presentation on Saturday.
It had been billed as the &#8220;Cathedral and the Bazaar&#8221;, but since he thought
most people had heard that, he instead talked about techniques for
convincing thought-leaders.
He stated that many in the OSI believe strongly in freedom, but he
believed that the only way to convince people to use OSS/FS was to
find a reason in <i>their own</i> self-interest to use OSS/FS.
<p>
In particular, I thought he correctly noted that large organizations do
<i>not</i> usually change bottom-up, because middle management&#8217;s job is
to <i>prevent</i> this;
instead, the job of determining strategic direction belongs to those
at the top.

<h2>End User Applications in Free Software</h2>
<p>
Janet Casey manages the Free Software Foundation / Unesco directory
of OSS/FS software, and thus had many interesting things to say
about how to evaluate software.
She referenced
<a href="https://dwheeler.com/oss_fs_why.html">my paper on evaluating
open source software / Free software (OSS/FS)</a> and said some
very nice things about my work -- thanks!
<p>
The parts I found most interesting were the things that she recommended
<i>developers</i> do with their websites, which can really aid users.
For example, make sure there&#8217;s a very short description of what your
program basically does, and contrast it with other programs that do
similar jobs.
And make sure it&#8217;s easy to download the program binary
or its source code... that
seems really obvious, but she showed examples where even these basics
weren&#8217;t easy at all.

<h2>Thin Clients and a Chimarr&#227;o</h2>
<p>
James McQuillan then gave a presentation about the Linux Terminal
Server project.
This project has influenced many, because in many circumstances it&#8217;s created
an incredibly cheap way to provide computing power to people.
This project lets you have just one computer run the actual programs,
while every user uses very cheap computers that talk with it
(they are often either old computers or tiny new computers
with no moving parts).
The users are simply running as X terminals.
<p>
This approach can <i>dramatically</i> decrease deployment costs
where it applies.
This is old technology in the Unix world,
but it still astonishes the many people who are unfamiliar with it.
The Linux Terminal Project makes setting up such configurations much
easier; as a result, it&#8217;s much easier to apply this approach.

<a href="images/tea-givers-big.jpg"><img src="images/tea-givers.jpg" align="right" width="230" height="154" alt="Tea-givers: Luis Aires and friends"></a>
<p>
During this, Luis Aires very kindly brought me a
chimarr&#227;o to try.
A chimarr&#227;o is basically a southern Brazilian hot tea, drunk with
a very distinctive cup and straw.
It was very tasty!
I did manage to spill some on me (oops!), sigh.
But they were very gracious -- and even more importantly,
provided me with a refill :-).
I had a picture with him and Glauber de Oliverra (&#8221;Glomer&#8221;).
That was <i>really</i> nice of you to bring all that stuff so I
could try out that tea -- thank you!!
Luis also offered to translate my presentation into several other languages,
and I&#8217;m grateful for that.
There were a lot of really friendly and helpful people there, and
Luis was definitely one of them.

<h2>Maddog: Pirated Software is not Free</h2>
<p>
Maddog gave his presentation, in this case on &#8220;pirated software
is not free&#8221;.
Maddog&#8217;s given name is
<a href="http://www.li.org/who/bio.php?name=hall">Jon Hall</a>,
but back when he was Department Head of Computer Science
at Hartford State Technical College, his students gave him the nickname maddog.
At this point, that&#8217;s how he&#8217;s known today.
Maddog is a kind, gentle, and very smart man, and as I noted earlier
he&#8217;s widely loved.
He&#8217;s more like a father figure to many I think;
he&#8217;s been in the computer industry since 1969,
using Unix since 1977, using Linux since 1994, and he&#8217;s been the
Executive Director of Linux International since 1995.
Interestingly, he once worked at AT&amp;T&#8217;s Bell Labs and
Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC).
<!-- Government Computer News, 07.05.05, page 18
     "The real cost of open-source software". -->
One conference organizer noted that planning for Maddog&#8217;s presentations
is easy -- they&#8217;re always packed, and always scheduled
last (as a closing presentation).
<p>
Maddog emphasized that pirated software
is <i>not</i> free -- it&#8217;s stealing.
He understood and sympathized with those who simply could not
afford proprietary programs -- he noted that it takes 10 months of
salary to buy one copy of Microsoft Windows in China, and Chinese know it
didn&#8217;t cost that much to make.
But that doesn&#8217;t make it any less wrong.
He also noted that those who support these people (e.g., through consulting
arrangements with people who they know are using illegal software copies) are
just as guilty.
<p>
And there are many hidden costs to illegal copying.
Obviously, a vendor will not provide knowing support, updates, improvements,
and so on for those who make illegal copies.
This means that people who use illegal copies give up any say in what their
future is, and risk being unable to get help when they need it.

<a href="images/maddog-kidtales-big.jpg"><img src="images/maddog-kidtales.jpg" align="right" width="154" height="103" alt="Maddog - tales of kids"></a>
<p>
He also believes that depending on illegal copies of proprietary
software robs countries of the benefits of really understanding software.
He had a wonderful set of examples of young kids who,
because the source code was free for them to study, had already made
a tremendous impact.
One kid was already making money selling his own specialized
OSS/FS distribution --
Maddog only heard about this because his parents were looking for
an accountant to help the kid manage his income (!).
At a different time, he heard three people argue about how to best modify
a program so it could perform well on a supercomputer -- and when
they turned the corner,
it turned out to be two HP engineers and an 11-year-old kid.
Oh, and the HP engineers were wrong... and the 11-year-old was right.
Why? Because just like the Internet,
&#8220;it doesn&#8217;t matter if you&#8217;re a dog&#8221; --
with OSS/FS, anyone (even a young person) can learn whatever they want to
learn, and pursue whatever interest they&#8217;d like to pursue.

<p>
He had some interesting comments about a Brazilian program to bring
computers to those in poverty.
Brazil plans to sell very inexpensive computers to poor people
with zero-interest loans so that they can have access to a computer.
Brazil currently plans to use OSS/FS software (operating systems,
office suites, and so on) to do this; this makes sense,
since it would cost much less to do things this way
in a very cost-sensitive circumstance.
Also, one of Brazil&#8217;s goals for this project appears to be to
increase understanding of computers among their poor;
if that&#8217;s so, it&#8217;s understandable why they would choose
software whose source code can be studied, modified, and redistributed.
As I understand Maddog&#8217;s presentation,
Microsoft complained, wanting their operating system there instead
(and at a higher price too!).
Apparently one of their objections was that
this project might increase illegal copies of
Windows (since people might buy the computers with the OSS/FS software, then
replace that software with an illegal copy of Windows).
Maddog said this was unlikely -- most people just use whatever comes with
their computer, so this project was likely to decrease piracy.
But Maddog had a very interesting response; he proposed that
if Microsoft was really worried about illegal copies of Microsoft Windows,
then Brazil should simply choose a different computer chip
(such as the Macintosh&#8217;s PowerPC chip)
so that the computer would <i>never</i> be able to run an illegal
copy of Windows.
Apparently the objections ceased at that point.
It will be interesting to see what happens next.

<p>
(An anonymous Groklaw participant has since pointed me to a
<a href="http://www.sinopolis.com/Archives/TOPSTORY/ts_990602.htm">
Fortune magazine article of July 20, 1998</a>, where Bill Gates says
&#8220;Though China sells around 3 million computers per year,
people don&#8217;t pay for software. But there will be one day,
when they will have to pay. So long as they want to steal,
I hope they will steal ours. They will become addicted.
Therefore, we can plan how to retrieve our money
some day in the next ten years.&#8221;)

<p>
The question and answer session was interesting.
At one point he noted that everyone treats him
very nicely -- and he&#8217;s grateful -- but he also wanted to make sure that
<i>others</i> were also appreciated for the work that they do.
Very gracious.

<h2>Conference Conclusion</h2>
<p>
The conference organizers then did a presentation about the
conference itself.
There were 4,414 participants that they knew of, including
3,013 &#8220;individual&#8221; participants, 222 speakers, and many
others with various titles and roles.
There had been a drive to collect food and money for the poor;
the conference collected 11.7 tons of food for the poor, and
3 tons of seeds for the poor via the free seed bank
(the seeds could produce 13,000 tons of food).
<p>
Presentations from the conference had
been broadcast through &#8220;TV software livre&#8221; using
only OSS/FS software.
All of the presentations were recorded using the patent-free
Ogg Vorbis (sound) and Ogg Theora (video) formats,
which are supported by more OSS/FS projects themselves;
at least 12,350 people had downloaded those presentations before the
conference had even ended.
They would also sell DVDs of the presentations for those who could not come.

<p>
The whole thing then closed off with a big party atmosphere -- hired
clowns walked around on stilts throwing candy into a delighted audience,
and big banners were placed announcing
the dates for next year&#8217;s conference.


<h2><a name="javaimp">OSS/FS Java Implementations</a></h2>


<a href="images/asking-java-questions-big.jpeg"><img src="images/asking-java-questions.jpeg" align="right" width="192" height="144" alt="Asking Java questions"></a>
<a href="images/initial-java-notes-big.jpeg"><img src="images/initial-java-notes.jpeg" align="right" width="192" height="144" alt="Initial Java notes"></a>


<p>
I then went off to dinner.
In this case I went with
Bruno Souza (president of SouJava, a Brazilian Java user group that
is a member of the Java Community Process),
Dalibor Topi&#263; (lead maintainer of Kaffe), and Mark Wielaard
(lead for GNU Classpath, the leading OSS/FS Java core library implementation).
This was great, because I wanted to grill them on exactly
what was going on with OSS/FS implementations of Java.
I had read up some of the pieces, but there just didn&#8217;t seem to be any
one place where you could get the big picture.
You could constantly crawl the web and individual project sites to see
a piece, but only a piece.
At FISL there had been several presentations that helped somewhat.
For example,
<a href="http://www.klomp.org/mark/classpath/GNUClasspathKaffe/">
Dalibor Topi&#263; and Mark Wielaard gave a presentation on
GNU Classpath and Kaffe</a>; if you&#8217;re interested in this topic
you should look at their presentation.
Their presentation explained how those two
pieces worked together, and a little bit about how <i>some</i> of the
related projects worked together, but that still didn&#8217;t give me the big
picture I was looking for.


<p>
In the end, this demonstrated why people go to conferences -- to
learn from each other.
Dalibor Topi&#263; and Mark Wielaard had an excellent grasp of their
technologies and how it fit into a larger picture,
but didn&#8217;t know what information their potential
users (like me) wanted to know.
This is a danger of being so steeped in an area -- you forget how much
other people <i>don&#8217;t</i> know.
I knew what I wanted to know (I wanted to understand the big picture and
how the project results worked together), but I didn&#8217;t
have the information.
I agreed to help them write down what was going on, if they in
turn would help me understand what was going on.
It seemed to be a fair trade to me.


<a href="images/type-type-type-big.jpeg"><img src="images/type-type-type.jpeg" align="right" width="192" height="144" alt="Type, type, type"></a>
<a href="images/java-notes-making-sense-big.jpeg"><img src="images/java-notes-making-sense.jpeg" align="right" width="192" height="144" alt="OSS/FS Java notes are starting to make sense"></a>
<a href="images/java-summarizing-big.jpeg"><img src="images/java-summarizing.jpeg" align="right" width="192" height="144" alt="Summarizing OSS/FS Java"></a>
<p>
In the end, we stayed up until 4:30am
(well, Bruno did snag a few moments of sleep near the end),
capturing the results in a fairly simple OpenOffice.org document.

<p>
It turns out that there are a lot of OSS/FS Java projects.
Each project has been working on some piece of Java,
and now they&#8217;re all filling in
so well that major Java applications work on them.
I played the part of journalist, to try to understand these pieces;
I repeatedly asked questions, working to
understand and simplify things to their essential points.

<p>
After a lot of discussion, I realized that the various projects
could be grouped into three categories: building the Java infrastructure
(virtual machines, tools, and class libraries), testing them, and
delivering their results:
<ul>
<li><i>Building</i>.
As far as building the basic infrastructure goes, they&#8217;ve come a long way,
and here&#8217;s the proof:
OpenOffice.org 2 and Eclipse now work on OSS/FS implementations of Java.
The major holdup is the class library; Java the language is small, but it
has a huge core library that people depend on.
GNU Classpath (the leading OSS/FS Java library) has grown considerably; it
now covers about 80% of the entire core library.
In years past the GUI parts were very incomplete in particular, but now
you can use AWT, javaGNOME (which interfaces to GTK+), and Eclipse SWT.
Swing support is still very incomplete, but many Java programs
don&#8217;t use Swing, so what&#8217;s there now is sufficient for many.
Swing support is one of the current major focuses
in GNU Classpath&#8217;s development,
<a href="http://kennke.org/blog/blosxom.cgi/2005/06/14#swing_progress">
and you can see they&#8217;ve already made a lot of progress.</a>.
They already have three OSS/FS J2EE implementations
(Jonas, JBoss, and Geronimo; the first two have already been J2EE certified).
And there is a massive set of useful OSS/FS Java libraries, many of
which are from the
<a href="http://www.apache.org/">Apache Software Foundation</a>.
<li><i>Testing</i>.
What&#8217;s especially good to see is that there&#8217;s a serious testing
infrastructure that&#8217;s been built up, too, to help quickly find and
remove any problems in the OSS/FS Java implementations.
They have Mauve doing lots of execution tests of the standard stack, and
JAPI uses static analysis to determine what&#8217;s left to do.
Other toolsuites such as Gump and Tinderbox detect problems and
regressions (in implementation or in portability).
<li><i>Delivering</i>.
Distributors are beginning to deliver these capabilities to users.
In particular,
the just-released Fedora Core 4 includes gcj (the gcc compiler suite with
a Java compiler), the GNU Classpath class library, and major applications
like Open Office 2 and Eclipse running on that.
JPackage is doing lots of packaging to make various other components easy
to install, too.
</ul>

<a href="images/java-summary-aftermath-big.jpeg"><img src="images/java-summary-aftermath.jpeg" align="right" width="192" height="144" alt="The aftermath"></a>
<p>
I handed off my summary to them, and in particular to SouJava.
I expect they&#8217;ll make various improvements.
They&#8217;ll probably cast it some different tone -- at this
point I view that work as their document.
I got what I wanted: A better understanding of their current status
and how they work together.

<h1>Sunday, June 5, 2005</h1>

<p>
Sunday morning, last day -- and there&#8217;s a big party for the
speakers at Pablo Lorenzzoni&#8217;s house.
Pablo was my point of contact for the conference, and I&#8217;m very grateful
to him... without him I don&#8217;t think I would have been able to be at
the conference at all.

<p>
I&#8217;ll once again say I was impressed with all the hard work the
conference organizers put in.
I&#8217;ve had to do some conference organizing myself, and thus I&#8217;ve had
a glimpse of the amount of trouble it is.
I was told by one person that they will intentionally not see each other for
two weeks... and then start preparing for next year&#8217;s conference.
And many were, indeed, going to help run the conference again.
That&#8217;s dedication!  And it shows by how well things went.

<p>
I never did get to see the southern cross (sigh) -- hopefully I&#8217;ll be
south of the equator again someday and get a chance to see it.

<p>
I talked with many different people, on a range of different topics.
For example, I briefly discussed human language translation with Leon.
I speculate that OSS/FS approaches like Wikipedia&#8217;s
might also work very well for developing
a Babblefish-like translation capability.
The trick would be establishing a Website
that enabled people to enter rules and translation data.
Instead of creating complex algorithms to do this, it would need to use
a straightforward (yet powerful) algorithm to do the matching,
and place all the &#8220;smarts&#8221; in data that could be maintained by a large
community.
It&#8217;d be an interesting experiment to see, at least.

<br clear="right">

<h2><a name="whyoss_strong">Why is OSS/FS so strong in Brazil?</a></h2>
<p>
One of those discussions at the party
was with Bruno Souza (head of SouJava), and it was
really interesting to me.
I asked hims a simple question: Why is OSS/FS so strong in Brazil?
He had some interesting answers:
<ol>
<li>Brazil has a <i>big</i> population. Yes, the percentage of Internet
penetration is relatively small (due to significant poverty issues), but
that still leaves many who can participate in OSS/FS.
<li>Brazil has serious social (poverty) issues.
Many try to help those in poverty,
but in the past software developers haven&#8217;t been able to use their skills
directly to help them... they could only donate money.
Now many OSS/FS projects exist to help the poor, and developers can contribute
what they&#8217;re best at specifically for them.
<li>Brazil has had a culture of code sharing that easily transformed into
OSS/FS development.
Company employees in Brazil have traditionally swapped code with each other
between companies, and the government has encouraged agencies to share their
code with other agencies.
After all, when you&#8217;re not made of money, it makes sense to reuse code, and
it&#8217;s perfectly legal to give it away if you developed it... especially when
there&#8217;s a cultural expectation that you&#8217;d get some back later.
These informal arrangements turned out to be similar in spirit to OSS/FS,
but typically were one-on-one arrangements.
With OSS/FS, all they had to do was to attach a small standard license clause,
and suddenly they could work with not just with someone they knew, but
with an entire global network of people.
This also translates really easily into an export business for Brazil.
<li>Brazil has a lot of expertise in infrastructure software development.
Historically there were Brazilian policies that made importing hardware
very difficult.
As a result, Brazil ended up cloning hardware, and then cloning software
to run on that hardware (e.g., clones of MS-DOS and so on).
By itself, I&#8217;d say that policy was a failure -- Brazil&#8217;s a large country,
and justifiably proud of its achievements, but it&#8217;s hard to keep up with
a worldwide economy.
But the interesting side-effect was that many in Brazil ended up understanding,
deeply, how infrastructure components work.
Having a highly trained workforce is almost never a bad idea.
As a result, it wasn&#8217;t hard at all for Brazilians to make significant
inroads in developing OSS/FS infrastructure software, once that started
becoming viable.
As a trivial example, the leader of the Linux kernel version 2.4
series is a young Brazilian.
<li>Brazil is <i>very</i> interested in protecting its own national
sovereignty, and is willing to go its own way when it perceives that
as threatened.
</ol>
<p>
But those only describe the environment -- not what happened.
Part of the answer seems to be in their
experience with &#8220;telecenters&#8221;
as a way to help the poor.
The cities of Porto Alegre and Sao Paolo separately decided to start
&#8220;telecenter&#8221; programs to provide computer access to the poor
(though the cities did consult with each other as each learned lessons).
There were definitely problems at first; according to some, early efforts
just plopped a center in an area and left the community to figure out what
to do (which often led to disappointing results).

<p>
But after some teething pains, they&#8217;ve had remarkable successes.
In Sao Paulo, they have about 200 centers, each with 20 computers, all
running OSS/FS (using the Linux Terminal Server project results, driving
the costs way down); one person estimates these 200 centers
reach 700,000 people.
Kids can only use them if they do well in school (encouraging school
participation), and they&#8217;re really community centers where there are
rooms to learn dancing, reading and writing, and so on.
Adults can use the centers to print their business cards, send resumes, and
so on, so that they can begin their own businesses or get a job.

<p>
They&#8217;ve had more success by first working with the communities to find out
what they need, and <i>then</i> specializing the center to that community.
I heard lots of great stories; for example, in one poverty-striken
inner-city community, its leaders
noted that they had few resources, but the local kids loved to
make music in the street.
So their center specialized and became a music recording studio
(all using OSS/FS, best as I understand it).
They&#8217;ve already produced a CD (through a lot of people working together),
with more on the way.
This not only brings in money, but possibly even more importantly,
there&#8217;s a sense of pride in that community that was not there before.
The point of these centers is simply to help people help themselves.
The telecenters have to be managed and self-supported by the community;
it&#8217;s not a continuous giveaway.
And they&#8217;re built using an approach they call a &#8220;public-private
partnership&#8221;.

<p>
In more recent Brazilian elections, a new Brazilian president was elected
from the same party as the leaders in Sao Paulo and Porto Alegre.
He thought these telecenters worked well, so now they&#8217;re spreading around
Brazil.

<p>
The combination of a government changing its own internal structure
to widespread use of OSS/FS, plus telecenters that use OSS/FS, mean that
there&#8217;s a vast number of people who are already familiar with OSS/FS,
and comfortable using it.
Very interesting indeed.
And I was very glad to hear the stories about people who started from
nothing, were given a small starting help, and are now on their feet
and helping others.

<h2>Baubles</h2>
<a href="images/last-minute-shopping-big.jpg"><img src="images/last-minute-shopping.jpg" align="right" width="154" height="103" alt="Last minute shopping"></a>
<p>
I realized I still hadn&#8217;t had a chance to do much shopping for baubles
to bring home, and few stores are open on Sunday.
There was a fair nearby, though, and Fabricio Flores went beyond the
call of duty and helped me get there, get a few things, and
get back to the party area in time.

<br clear="left">
<h2>Getting Home</h2>
<p>
I rushed to the airport and got on my plane back to Sao Paulo.
I then rushed to get my connecting flight... and found out my plane had
been delayed 4 hours. Ugh.
Leon Shiman (of the X.Org Foundation) was supposed to go on the same plane,
so he was stuck in the same boat.
The airlines were very apologetic, and they did shuttle us to a hotel
to have dinner (we were supposed to get it on the plane).
Leon and I had a chance to talk; Leon is a sharp cookie and has
seen a lot of interesting things.
Leon in particular helped me understand better the history of X
over the years, as well as where it seemed to be going.

<p>
This flight delay was definitely not in my plans.
When I arrived in the U.S., I had to rush straight from the airport to
work, shower and change there, and rush off to an important meeting
that I <i>had</i> to be at.

<p>
But believe it or not, it was worth it.
I had a good time, I learned lots, and hopefully I helped some others too.
