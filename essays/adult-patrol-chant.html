<h1 class="title">Adult Patrol Chant</h1>

<p>
My son's Boy Scout troop has chants for each patrol - and they
wanted the adult patrol to have one too.  Here's my try
(capital letters indicate stress):

<p>
<b>COFFee, COBBler, EASy CHAIRs, we're</br>
HERE to HELP you BE prePARED!</b>

<p>
If you've never been involved in Boy Scouts, perhaps some
explanation is in order.
The adults generally know how to camp, but we also like creature comforts.
So it's not surprising to find the adults gathered with
coffee pots, a cobbler dessert at night (peach cobbler is great,
and dutch ovens are great for making them), and easy chairs.
But we're really there for the scouts, whose motto is "be prepared".
