<i>This essay helps individuals, companies, governments, and other
organizations choose a free-libre / open source software (FLOSS) license.
If it's a modification to an existing project, and you're releasing
the modification back to the FLOSS project, you should normally
release the modification using that project's license (at least).
If it's a new project,
where possible, you should only choose one of these licenses: MIT, BSD-new,
LGPL, or GPL (and maybe Apache 2.0).
Understand their differences, and then
make your selection for each project based on your goals for that project.</i>
<p>
<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>
There are now a vast number of
<a href="https://dwheeler.com/oss_fs_refs.html">
Free-Libre / open source software
(FLOSS, FOSS, or OSS/FS) programs</a>; billions of dollars of effort have
gone into their development.
In other documents I show that
<a href="https://dwheeler.com/oss_fs_why.html">
there are many quantitative studies justifying FLOSS use</a> and that
<a href="https://dwheeler.com/essays/commercial-floss.html">FLOSS
programs are commercial programs</a>.
<p>
But if you choose to <i>develop</i> FLOSS software, you will need to
license it somehow.
Problem is, there are dozens of FLOSS licenses...
so which license do you choose?
<p>
The answer is usually easy
if you're making a minor modification to an existing FLOSS program,
and want to submit the change back to the FLOSS project:
you have to (at least) release the modification
using that FLOSS program's existing license.
This often includes creating plug-ins or general-purpose
programming language libraries.
There are good reasons to submit a change back to the main FLOSS project:
if you submit it, and it's a real improvement,
the change is is likely to be included in future versions of the program.
If that happens, you don't bear the substantial burden of maintenance
(where nearly all software development costs are,
as documented by Dr. Barry Boehm and others).
Thus, when you get a later version of the program, you get the benefit
of the improvements you made (and presumably needed), along with improvements
made by many others.
Usually the existing FLOSS project requires you to use their license as-is,
so there isn't really a decision <i>between</i> licenses - it's
a decision on whether or not using one particular
licensing model is acceptable for your component.
An organization will typically
need to review the release for various legal reasons
to make sure they aren't giving away crown jewels, but that's it.
You might want to <i>also</i> release the software under another
more popular license, if the existing FLOSS program uses a relatively
non-standard one, in which case this document can still help you.

<p>
But if you're starting a new project
(including a major new subproject), or for some other reason
you have a license choice, you must choose a license...
and this can get complicated in a hurry.
This can be even more complicated for organizations
like businesses and governments, because there may be many people
who have to agree on the decision.
There are dozens of existing licenses that you could choose, and of
course there are many other decisions if you choose to write your own license.

<p>
Yet it turns out that this is really much easier in most cases
than people make it.
Generally you should (1) only consider a very short list of
mutually-compatible licenses that are widely used (as described next),
(2) gain more understanding of those few licenses,
and (3) pick one of them based on
your <i>goals</i> for that particular project.

<h1>Consider a Very Short List of Licenses</h1>

<p>
Fundamentally, FLOSS development approaches work because they enable
people to work together to build more capable or higher-quality works
than they could (for the same amount of effort) if they did not release
the software under a FLOSS license.
But this is only true where people <i>can</i> work together; licenses
that make software impossible to recombine software into larger
solutions (i.e., incompatible licenses)
significantly reduces the effectiveness of FLOSS approaches.

<p>
Back in 1999,
<a href="http://perens.com/OSD.html">Bruce Perens</a> warned of
the problem, saying,
"Do not write a new license if it is possible to use [an existing common
license].  The propogation of many different and incompatible licenses
works to the detriment of Open Source software because fragments of one
program can not be used in another program with an incompatible license."
By 2005,
<a href="http://www.infoworld.com/article/05/08/09/HNhpfink_1.html">
HP's Martin Fink pleaded for reduction in the number of FLOSS licenses</a>.
The
<a href="http://opensource.org/proliferation-report">
Open Source Initiative (OSI)'s proliferation report</a>, which was
a response to this outcry,
noted that people used the term "license proliferation" with at least
three meanings:
<ol>
<li>too many different licenses makes it difficult for licensors to choose
[what license to use].
<li>some licenses do not play well together.
"Some people use 'license proliferation' to refer to the fact
that some open source licenses do not inter-operate well with
other open source licenses...
This comment generally came from larger companies."
<li>too many licenses makes it difficult to understand what
you are agreeing to in a multi-license distribution.
(e.g., "it takes a lot of time to read and understand them all").  
</ol>
In my mind, it is the second meaning that is the biggest problem,
as suggested by Perens.
In short,
there is much less value to a FLOSS approach if no one can make further
improvements in a project due to a forest of incompatible licenses.
The third point is a variation on the second.
This paper is hopefully a solution to the first point, the problem
of choosing a license in the first place.

<p>
So why are there many odd,
almost-never-used FLOSS licenses that have immediately
died off, in spite of numerous calls by FLOSS experts to <i>not</i> create
new licenses?
I believe that one cause was that companies often called on their
"intellectual property" (IP) lawyers when considering
licensing a program under FLOSS.
While these lawyers typically understand the
legal underpinnings (e.g., copyright law), they typically did not
fully understand what their clients were trying to do.
In particular, I suspect that they often failed to
understand the critical importance of working with a larger
community of developers, including the ability to reuse others' code,
to have that code be reused, and/or to be able to quickly understand
the rights granted without needing to read dozens of legal licenses.
Many lawyers are trained in how to create new contracts,
and these lawyers were under the mistaken assumption that
since they were releasing new code,
they could simply write a tailored, unique license for each new project.
Unfortunately, they failed to realize that these unique licenses, though
possibly quite good in isolation, were
incompatible with the existing wisely-used
FLOSS licenses that cover software representing
billions of dollars of effort.
They also failed to realize that developers don't really want to read
hundreds of different legal licenses and then figure out the consequences
of merging them; instead, developers want a very few licenses so that
such legal headaches are avoided.
In many cases, no one even checked to see if it really met the
Open Source Definition or the Free Software Definition.
But even the list of licenses that did pass such scrutiny is very long.
The predictable result was projects that languished because developers
could - and did! - ignore the software that was released under these
odd licenses, precisely because it used non-standard licensing.

<p>
In short, when releasing a new project,
you should only consider using one of a very short list of
mutually-compatible licenses that are widely used.
This will enable you to combine that software later with other programs
developed by others.

<p>
So, how can you derive that set of licenses?
Several sites, such as Freshmeat and SourceForge,
maintain statistics on FLOSS project licenses. Other studies such as my
<a href="https://dwheeler.com/sloc">Gigabuck</a> paper examine the
number of lines of code in various programs actually in use.
Their results tend to be quite similar, even though their sampling methods
are different.
According to Freshmeat, as of 2007-07-31 the top ten FLOSS licenses are:

<center>
<table border="1">
<tr><th>License</th><th>Percentage</th></tr>
<tr><td>GNU General Public License (GPL)</td><td>65.50%</td></tr>
<tr><td>GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL)</td><td>6.53%</td></tr>
<tr><td>BSD License (original)</td><td>2.93%</td></tr>
<tr><td>BSD License (revised)</td><td>2.86%</td></tr>
<tr><td>MIT/X Consortium License</td><td>1.67%</td></tr>
<tr><td>Artistic License</td><td>1.55%</td></tr>
<tr><td>Public Domain</td><td>1.15%</td></tr>
<tr><td>The Apache License 2.0</td><td>0.86%</td></tr>
<tr><td>Mozilla Public License (MPL)</td><td>0.72%</td></tr>
<tr><td>The Apache License</td><td>0.56%</td></tr>
</table>
</center>

<p>
In short, all surveys
agree that the most popular FLOSS license <i>by far</i> is the
GNU GPL - <i>most</i> FLOSS programs are released under the GNU GPL, and
no other FLOSS license is even <i>close</i> to its popularity.
This does not mean that you must choose the GNU GPL license, but
it <i>does</i> meant that if you are wise,
you will choose a license that is <i>compatible</i> with the GPL.
The paper
<a href="https://dwheeler.com/essays/gpl-compatible.html">
"Make Your Open Source Software GPL-Compatible. Or Else."</a>
explains in much more detail why GPL-compatibility is a necessary
condition for a useful FLOSS license today, including many other
quantitative studies.

<p>
So among the GPL-compatible licenses, how far should you look?
Clearly, the list above of the most popular licenses is a reasonable
starting point.
The
<a href="http://opensource.org/proliferation-report">OSI proliferation
report</a> also identifies a very small set of
"Licenses that are popular and widely used or with strong communities".
In short, take lists of the most popular licenses (like those),
extract the GPL-compatible licenses, and you have a good starting point.

<p>
The FLOSS licenses that meet this minimal criteria
(the most popular licenses that are
combinable with software that uses the most popular FLOSS license)
are the MIT, BSD-new, LGPL, and GPL licenses.
Historically the compatibility of the Apache 2.0 license with the GPL
was debated; with the new GPL version 3 (GPLv3), there is no question, as it's
universally acknowledged that the Apache 2.0 license is compatible with GPLv3.
(The issue of the new version of the GPL and LGPL will be addressed later.)
So there are at least reasons to consider using the Apache 2.0 license.

<p>
Do <i>not</i> release software to the public domain (that is, specifially
disclaiming <i>any</i> copyright) unless you are a
U.S. government employees who wrote the software as part of your
official duties.
Software in the public domain is compatible with all other FLOSS licenses,
so from a <i>compatibility</i> perspective "public domain" is a fine choice.
But there are some legal debates on whether or not it's even legally possible
in the U.S. to release software to the public domain.
In addition, releasing software to the public domain
strips the developer of some legal protections against lawsuits that
all popular FLOSS licenses provide.
For U.S. government employees this is less of an issue, since the
government can't be sued unless the government permits it (!), but it's
a serious issue for anyone else.
All lawyers who have seriously examined the issue have recommended
using FLOSS licenses that include legal disclaimers.
Releasing software under the MIT
license is essentially the same as releasing to the public domain, but
with additional legal protections, so it's much wiser to use the MIT
license instead of releasing to the public domain.

<p>
Other relatively widely-used licenses have problems, including the
Artistic and MPL licenses.
Even
<a href="http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/opensources/book/perens.html">back
in 1999, Perens recommended against using the Artistic license</a>
because of clarity problems.
The new Artistic license version 2.0 helps, but other licenses make
sense to use unless you're making a library for Perl
(a special community who typically use a GPL / Artistic dual license).
The Mozilla Public License (MPL) was originally developed for
Mozilla, but is GPL-incompatible; Mozilla found that this was such a
mistake that they ended up relicensing their software under the
MPL, LGPL, and GPL.
Bruce Perens helped write the Netscape Public License (NPL), which the MPL
is based on, and has this to say about his own creation:
"Many companies have adopted a variation of the MPL for their own programs.
This is unfortunate, because the NPL was designed for the specific
business situation that Netscape was in at the time it was written,
and is not necessarily appropriate for others to use.
It should remain the license of Netscape and Mozilla,
and others should use the GPL or the or X licenses."

<p>
Again, this is only discussing <i>new</i> projects.
If you're modifying an existing program, and returning your modification
back to the project, you'll normally need to release it with whatever
license is used by the project.
If your project must work with an existing project (e.g., it's a
library for a language, or a plug-in), you should normally use the license
common for that particular community... again, to maximize code reuse.
So if you're making a library for Perl, you should normally
license it under both the Artistic and GPL license, because that is a
special community who typically use a GPL / Artistic dual license.
But these are special cases.

<p>
So now we're down to a nice short list:
MIT, BSD-new, LGPL, and GPL licenses (with versioning issues for
LGPL and GPL)... and possibly Apache 2.0.
Now let's examine what they mean, and how to select between them.

<h1>Gain understanding of those few licenses</h1>

<p>
Now that we've winnowed down the set of possible licenses to a few
reasonable possibilities, we can examine them in more detail.

<p>
Unsurprisingly, the main licenses can be grouped into just a few
categories, which reflect significant differences in their general goals.
In particular, FLOSS licenses can be generally be grouped into
"permissive" licenses or "protective" licenses.
"Permissive" licenses permit the software to be released under
non-FLOSS terms, while "protective" (aka copyleft)
licenses protect the software from being released under non-FLOSS terms.
There are, in turn, two main types of protective licenses;
ones that only protect that particular module (but allow it to be
included in a non-FLOSS program), and strongly protective licenses
(which require that if the module is in a larger program, the entire
program must be FLOSS).

<p>
Here's a simple matrix that summarizes this:

<table border="1">
<tr>
<th>License</th>
<th>Must receive source code of module modifications</th>
<th>Entire Mixed result must be FLOSS</th>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Permissive (MIT, BSD-new, Apache 2.0)</td>
<td>no</td>
<td>no</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Weakly protective (LGPL)</td>
<td>yes</td>
<td>no</td>

<tr>
<td>Strongly protective (GPL)</td>
<td>yes</td>
<td>no</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>
The MIT, BSD-new, and Apache 2.0 licenses are all permissive licenses.
So, software released under these licenses can be incorporated into
proprietary programs and made proprietary.

??? Compare/contrast them.
I recommend MIT instead of BSD-new OR Apache 2.0, (explain) - but all work.
<p>
??? Discuss GPL/LGPL versioning.  v2, v3, v2+, v3+, v2/v3 and id someone
Note that GPLv3 adds anti-Tivoization - difference in goals for some.

<p>
??? Discuss "GPL linking exception" of Classpath or GMGPL?
Unfortunately these are often listed as just "GPL", so numbers are
hard to come by; the point is that they don't require relinking, and/or
generics are okay.

<p>
Side-effects of each:

<p>
Permissive: _Code_ gets more widely used (incorporated into proprietary
projects too), but the FLOSS _project_ risks always losing momentum
because developers are not required to release changes back to project.
Much higher risk of forking, esp. with proprietary branches
(financial incentive to do so).
Often ends up with many incompatible branches, many of them proprietary,
which do not share code/improvements, and eventually branches cannot
share code or improvements.
Ex: BSD.
This risk doesn't always happen, e.g., Apache project going strong.
Permissive very useful in getting an idea or a specification in use.

<p>
Protective: FLOSS project stays FLOSS, because license requires it.
Multiple companies may work on it together, because there's no financial
incentive to forking.
Thus, project more protected against forks, and strongly
protected from proprietary forks... so more likely to have a strong project
maintaining the software.
Ex: GTK+ toolkit, Linux kernel.
Weak copyleft (LGPL): Modifications of component stay FLOSS, but
component users can be either both proprietary or FLOSS programs, so
wider use than strong copyleft.
Strong copyleft (GPL): Modifications or users of component must be GPL
(essentially).  For some, this is a problem; for others, it's an advantage,
as discussed further below.


<h1>Pick a license based on your goals for that particular project</h1>

<p>
We've now found a small set of license candidates, and we've looked at their
basic differences.
But many guides stop here, and that's unfortunate.
Just knowing about licenses for many people isn't enough; the question
is, which license should you pick?

<p>
<i>The best license for a project depends on your goals for that project</i>.
Different licenses support different kinds of maintenance approaches
and business models.
So, you should decide on your goal (including your business model), then
map to licenses.
Indeed, I personally have released different programs
under different licenses (the MIT, LGPL, and GPL licenses, as well as
proprietary) - because I had different goals for each one.
Even the FSF, creator and a strong backer of the GPL, supports other licenses
on occasion depending on their goals.

<p>
Let's first quickly dispel a myth, though.
???
Which license is "most business-friendly"? Answer: They all are.
Each license is the most business-friendly, depending on your business model.
Ref quotes.


<p>
Developing or trying to choose a "perfect" license that exactly meets
your goals, but is non-standard (uncommon), is in the end a disaster.
You don't want the code merely to exist; you want to encourage others to
help improve and maintain it, so that the costs of doing so are
distributed to others.
Instead, it is better to pick a common and "good enough" license
that enables you to build a large community.
It's not hard to find analogies;
vast effort has been spent to create common rulesets for commerce,
including international agreements such as the
"Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works",
and intra-national agreements such as the
U.S. "Uniform Commercial Code" (UCC).
Without common laws, commerce would be greatly impeded.
Common FLOSS licenses have the same result; by having a few FLOSS
licenses that are easily combined, uncertainty is greatly reduced.
Reduced uncertainty results in more commerce, and thus,
more wealth for everyone (and I mean wealth in its more general sense,
including the set of goods and services available to you).
If combining FLOSS code
required the review of 50 different licenses to ensure compatibility,
nothing worthwhile could be done.

<p>
Ideally, you'd consider a host of different business models, select one,
and select the license that best supports it.
Things are not quite cut-and-dried, indeed,
<a href="http://robertogaloppini.net/2007/07/25/open-source-business-models-joint-research-announcement/">
there's research in this area</a>.
But new business models and markets are constantly being developed
in other areas, too, and yet much has been learned that is still relevant.
So let's look at what <i>does</i> seem to have held up to the test of time.

<p>
??? List common business models, map to licenses.

<p>
???: GPL with linking exception is common but stats misleading, because
often just labelled as "GPL". Also, there are language-specific versions
(GNAT Modified GPL = GMGPL, one used by Java inc. CLASSPATH,
LISP community, etc.)


<p>
Network-protective licenses increasing in interest.

<p>
License explains:
MIT/X11 and BSD-new: Wide use of CODE, but forking often weakens project (see BSD).  May have to buy to use latest,
even if did most of development.
Moglen: If you're a business, you want your COMPETITORS to release using MIT/X11 and BSD-new.

<p>
GPL: Consortia.  (Trade: you give IP to a consortia, in return you are guaranteed to
receive other's IP).  Project resists forking (e.g., Linux kernel) because little economic incentive.
Originally created by FSF to create an alternative to proprietary software,
by creating a set of software that wasn't proprietary.
Even if don't agree with goal, they've established an entire suite of
software that is very valuable, and many organizations have chosen
to support these...

<p>
LGPL: Compromise.

<p>
Dual-license with GPL/LGPL: Only copyright holder can grant additional rights.
Need copyright assignments from others to make it work well; often end up doing lots of own development,
but at least get much better (more actionable) bug reports, etc.

<p>
Government: Policy of "all MIT" is defensible if truly all, but if sometimes sell to proprietary, then
sometimes other alternatives appropriate too.

<h1>Conclusions</h1>

<p>
These are only my recommendations.
This isn't legal advice (I'm not a lawyer), and in rare cases there
are special circumstances that mean these aren't sufficient.
Yet for most people, in most circumstances, I believe following
these recommendations will give you the best results, and I hope
that you will find them helpful.

Note that it is rare to identify which version of the GPL is in use;
many projects simply say "GPLv2 or later", or "any version of the GPL".
If you combine the GPL, GPLv2, and GPLv3 values, you get a total of
65.80% (65.50%+0.09%+0.21%).
Similiarly, the Apache 2.0 license has 0.86%, but
"the Apache License" has 0.56% (and it's likely that at least some of
them are Apache 2.0), so the total for all Apache license versions
is 1.42%.

<a href="http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/osfreesoft/book/">
Understanding Open Source and Free Software Licensing
by Andrew M. St. Laurent (book)</a>
(August 2004).
This book has several chapters focusing
on the terms of specific licenses, with a few other
chapters on broader license-related topics.
Here are its chapters:
<ol>
<li>Open Source Licensing, Contract, and Copyright Law
<li>The MIT, BSD, Apache, and Academic Free Licenses
<li>The GPL, LGPL, and Mozilla Licenses
<li>Qt, Artistic, and Creative Commons Licenses
<li>Non-Open Source Licenses
<li>Legal Impacts of Open Source and Free Software Licensing
<li>Software Development Using Open Source and Free Software Licenses
</ol>
In chapter 7, he notes that
"Depending on the license, the developer may or may not have
the ability to choose a different license to apply to the new project.
If that pre-existing project uses an MIT or BSD-type license,
the developer can use virtually any license, so long as the proper
notification and disclaimer provisions are included.
On the other hand, if the pre-existing project were licensed
under the GPL, the developer would have little choice
but to license his or her own project under the GPL or
to get permission from the author to use a different license...
in many situations, a developer’s choice of license is constrained by
choices made by his predecessors.
<p>
In those situations in which a developer is in fact starting
from scratch or from code whose license is amenable to change,
the decision as to license will probably be largely a
matter of personal preference. The factors that might influence this deci-
sion include: how frequently used and well-known the license is;
how readily comprehensible that license is;
and finally, and perhaps most importantly, the license’s
philosophy, and, in particular, the extent to which the license allows with
code developed under other licenses, including proprietary licenses.
<p>
"In choosing any license to apply to a new project, developers
should strongly consider relying on those licenses already well-known
in the development community.
This makes the project much more transparent to other developers and potential
contributors who will probably have a better grasp of the principles
of the BSD, MIT, Apache, MPL, and GPL Licenses, than they would
of the Monongahela Copper Mining Institute Database License, v8.3.
To the extent that licensing issues are important to contributors,
using a license already known to them reduces barriers to entry
and will likely make for a more successful project.
For much the same reason, using licenses that are written more
clearly and which do not contain ambiguous or unusual terms will
also help a project succeed. The BSD and MIT Licenses
are models in this regard. The Apache License Version 1.1 is both
clear and well-known in the development community, and Version 2.0 is becoming
more familiar. The GPL and MPL Licenses, while considerably more complex, are
well-written and their principles are well-understood. Developers should avoid
licenses that seem ambiguous, unduly confusing, or poorly written.
The most important decision in choosing a license will
be the choice between a GPL License and a
less restrictive license. A full discussion of the disagreement between
the two camps is beyond the scope of this book. However, to put it briefly,
the GPL is premised on the belief that non-free software is to
be avoided and that free software development projects should be
set up to encourage open development models
of software development and to discourage reliance on software
not developed under
an open development model, including all
proprietary-licensed software. By requiring
that any code developed from or based on GPL-licensed code be GPL-licensed,
the GPL creates a strong incentive for programmers to license their
code under a GPL License, in the form of access to all the code already
GPL-licensed.  The argument in favor of less-restrictive licenses—such
as the MIT, BSD, Apache, and MPL Licenses — is that open development
model of software development is not inconsistent with the development
of software under other models, including proprietary models.  The fact
that one line of a program, such as the Sendmail program described in
Chapter 2, is developed under a proprietary license, does not undermine
the open development model, in this view. The more developers and users
that are involved in working on particular code, the better, even if
some of that development takes place in “closed” development models
under proprietary licenses.  In sum, there is no ready answer as to which
license is the best for a given project.  While a certain license may
be better suited for a project, particularly when a substantial amount
of work has already been done under that license, such decisions depend
largely on circumstances and on the taste of the project developer.
<p>
As should be evident from the previous discussion, drafting a new open
source license is probably not the best place to start for most open
source projects. In addition to the extra time and expense associated with
drafting any legal document, the use of a new license will discourage
potential contributors from participating in the project. Those
contributors who are concerned about licensing implications will want
to read and understand the license. Particularly in the case of long or
complex licenses, this may present a substantial barrier to entry."
<p>
Chapter 7 also notes that, "by permitting non-open
development of code developed under them, code licensed under the MIT or
the BSD License may be more prone to forking than code
licensed under other licenses."

They state that
"It is vital that you read and understand all of the terms of a license,
and verify that it meets the needs of your project, before deciding to
use that license; this should not be a decision taken lightly.
It is also important to understand the possible interaction
of license terms on the ability for other developers to integrate
your software in to their own."
SourceForge notes that choosing a license that is both an
OSI-approved Open Source license and one considered a Free Software license
"can help to broaden the audience for your software".
While they do not "take sides" on licenses, they specifically note that
"The most common license choices include: GNU General Public License
(GPL), GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL), Mozilla Public License
(MPL), BSD License, Apache Software License, and MIT License. A large
amount of software has also been released in to the Public Domain."

"Understanding Open Source Software" by Red Hat's Mark Webbink, Esq.,
Groklaw, December 31, 2003.</a>
(originally published in the March 2003
Journal of the New South Wales Society for Computers and the Law).
This is a good overview of the legal basis of FLOSS licenses;
"Mark Webbink, Senior Vice President and General Counsel of Red Hat, Inc.,
wrote this article for corporate attorneys, explaining
free and open source software and comparing various open source licenses,
detailing how the GPL really works, explaining US copyright law,
and listing some corporate law office best practices for software,
from the standpoint of what policies are prudent for the corporate environment.
He also explains how derivative works are defined, touches on the
indemnification issue and the difference between
open source and 'shared source', and highlights some of
the main myths and misconceptions about the GPL and open source."
Its major headings are
What is Open Source Software?,
Fundamentals of Copyright Law,
Types of Open Source Licenses
(he divides them into
Non-Protective and Protective Licenses, where
"protective" ensures that the code will always remain open/free),
The GNU General Public License,
What is a Derivative Work?,
Where does the law stand on derivative works in software?,
How do these tests apply to derivative works in Open Source software?,
Myths About Open Source, and
Corporate Law Office Best Practices for Software.
Diagram 1 shows how rights in copyright vary in a spectrum:
public domain, non-protective FLOSS licenses, protective FLOSS licenses,
proprietary programs, and finally trade secrets.
Diagram 2 compares the rights granted for the public domain,
BSD, GPL, and Windows 98 licenses, contrasting these rights:
copyright retains,
right to perform, right to display, right to copy,
right to modify, and right to distribute.
He represents a commercial company that is based on selling GPL'ed software,
so his material is a useful antidote to the
"GPL'ed software cannot be commercial software" argument.

"Open Source License Comparison" by David Wallace Croft
(2003-05-05)</a>
is a short summary comparing several major licenses:
<ul>
<li>AFL: Academic Free License (replaces Apache, BSD, and MIT)
<li>CPL: Common Public License (akin to LGPL?)
<li>LGPL: GNU Lesser General Public License (a.k.a. Library GPL)
<li>OSL: Open Software License (akin to GPL?)
<li>GPL: GNU General Public License (most popular)
</ul>
He has three criteria:
<ul>
<li>[Must] Maintain Attribution and Disclaimer
<li>Must Distribute Modified Source [when distribute binary]
<li>[Must use] Same License for Larger Work [it is embedded in]
</ul>
He believes that
"Other Open Source licenses have been excluded because I believe
that they have been superannuated by modern licenses such
as the AFL, CPL, and the OSL. The GPL and LGPL may fit
into this category but I included them because they are widely used."
<p>
Unfortunately, this view completely fails to take into account the
large body of existing code and projects, and the license compatibility
problem such license changes cause.
In practice, the AFL, CPL, and OSL are rarely used compared to the
GPL or LGPL, and there
is no evidence that they are significantly gaining in support... but
these facts don't strongly impact the article.
Thus, while the analysis is valid, and the questions asked in particular
are valuable, I do not recommend
using this list as a "recommended" list of licenses.
But these licenses are reasonable <i>representatives</i> of
permissive (BSD-new, MIT, AFL), weak copyleft
(LGPL, CPL), and strong copyleft (GPL, OSL) licenses, so using them
as a starting point for thinking about the issues is a good idea.

Evaluation of Public Software Licenses

This old document suggests that the lowest levels (e.g., operating system)
tend to be GPLed, while the higher layers (e.g., toolkits and applications)
will be split between proprietary and non-proprietary licenses.
He specifically examines the issue of forking, suggesting that
permissive licenses (e.g., BSD-new) are far more likely to fork than
GPL'ed software.

"Choosing an open source license" by
Mary E. Tyler, NewsForge, July 26, 2004</a>.

Lawrence E. Rosen is general counsel of the Open Source Initiative (OSI),
so not surprisingly he's very knowledgeable.
<p>
Rosen's book is a general book about FLOSS
licensing, and well worth reading.
It's a little old (much has happened since), as a lawyer he goes into
depth that many people won't want, and he takes specific positions
that in several cases are debatable; but if you want some depth in analysis
of the legal issues, this is a good place to start.
Here's a list of the book sections:
Freedom and Open Source; Intellectual Property; Distribution of Software;
Taxonomy of Licenses; Academic Licenses [meaning licenses
such as MIT and BSD-new]; Reciprocity and the GPL;
The Mozilla Public License (MPL); The Common Public License (CPL);
The OSL and the AFL; Choosing an Open Source License;
Shared Source, Eventual Source, and Other Licensing Models;
Open Source Litigation; and Open Standards; it concludes with
a non-chapter labelled The Open Source Paradigm.
<p>
This book's chapter 10 is specifically on "Choosing an Open Source License".
He first discusses free-riders -
where licensees reap benefits of others’ work with no return obligations.
Open source software licenses can't completely halt free-riding,
though reciprocal (aka protective or copylefting)
licenses have the advantage of requiring free-riding
to be equally shared by all distributors of derivative works
(not just by the original licensor).
Instead, he notes that
most in the FLOSS community believe that the
"growing commons of open source software that generally results
from open source licensing is...
sufﬁcient reward for allowing everyone to be free-riders."
<p>
Regarding the question
"How can we make money from distributing this software
under an open source license?",
he first notes that business models that rely on selling software at high
per-copy prices don't work well, because FLOSS licenses
allow anyone to become a distributor and compete on price,
driving the per-copy price down.
But of course, this is not the only possible development model;
commercial companies "can make money on what the open source
license doesn’t grant. For this reason, it is often more rewarding
to consider the exclusions from license rather than the open
source grants of license when looking for opportunities for proﬁt.
The most important exclusion is trademark or brand identity.
Trademarks are excluded from all open source licenses,
either explicitly or implicitly...
Despite their protestations that quality matters most, companies
and individuals usually acquire software not by function
but by reputation. Trademarks are thus very important
factors in consumer decisions...
By marketing software under a trademark, the licensor can sell
perceived value...
customers are often willing to pay for brand-name software,
particularly if it comes with support and other beneﬁts...
Also excluded from several open source licenses, for many
of the same reasons, are the names and reputations of the
licensors...  Most warranties are also excluded from the open source
licenses in this book. A separate business can be made from
selling such warranties — as well as other support and
installation services - separate from the software itself.
Finally, the licensor of open source software is always free to
license his or her software also under other terms and condi-
tions [aka dual licensing]."
<p>
Rosen pleads:
"If at all possible, licensors should use an existing template license.
Please don’t invent your own. The open source community
is not seeking new licenses to analyze and interpret.
The proliferation of open source licenses creates a serious
problem: It risks additional fragmentation of the public commons
of free software. While software under some academic
licenses can be combined without restriction, combining soft-
ware under different reciprocal licenses — particularly the more
complex reciprocal licenses used by large companies — requires
that lawyers or skilled licensing professionals review each of
the licenses for incompatibilities. Even where the differences
between licenses are trivial, such as their designation of governing
law, a combinatorial analysis of open source licenses
rapidly becomes a nontrivial exercise...
Without exception, leaders of the open source community
discourage the submission of 'yet another license.'
Any software company deciding to distribute its software under an
open source license is fervently encouraged to select among
the existing licenses rather than to create a new one."
<p>
I should make a few comments about this book, esp. regarding some
of the specific positions he takes.
Rosen states that while the FSF believes the Apache and GPLv2 licenses
are incompatible, Rosen believes they are compatible.
This view is
probably less widely held nowadays, especially given the special additional
changes to make GPLv3 compatible with the Apache 2.0 license, and when
Rosen claims it's just about trademarks I believe he is in error.
Note that he uses the term "Academic license" instead of "permissive",
which I find a little misleading; many academic organizations use other
kinds of licenses, and many non-academic organizations use permissive licenses.
His term "reciprocal" is different than the term
"protective" used by many others, but it's a very good term.
<p>
The text above notes the many problems of creating new licenses,
but elsewhere he lists a long list of legal
questions to consider about licenses.
That's fine, but beware of being led by those questions into creating
a new license anyway; examining all issues can be valuable, but
creating a "perfect" new license will almost certainly be worse than
picking a "close enough" license that enables you to build a community
and reuse existing code.
Indeed, he is himself the creator of "yet another license";
he created the "Academic Free License" (AFL), which he likes (naturally).
Just considering things from a legal point-of-view, the AFL is a fine
license, but that is not enough.
The problem is, the AFL is not a popular license, and in particular versions
1.2 and 2.1 are GPL-incompatible (a terrible idea), and version 3.0's
GPL-compatibility is not yet known (but I expect that it's incompatible too).
I believe
the AFL should <i>never</i> be used, if at all possible, until its
compatibility with the GPL is assured; its use is just too marginal to
justify making yourself incompatible with most FLOSS programs in most cases.
<p>
Rosen also has very interesting papers on

licenses, and discusses why you should
choose one license over another.
His paper includes the first license comparison matrix that I'm aware of.
He also says, even back in 1999,
"Do not write a new license if it is possible to use one of the ones
listed here. The propogation of many different and incompatible licenses
works to the detriment of Open Source software because fragments of one
program can not be used in another program with an incompatible license."

Open Source Software Law
by Rod Dixon.
Rod Dixon has strong legal credentials; he is a senior attorney-advisor,
U.S. Department of Education, and a visiting assistant professor of law,
Rutgers University Law School (at Camden, New Jersey).
He holds an LL.M. from Georgetown University Law Center,
a J.D. from The George Washington University Law School,
and an M.A. from the University of Pittsburgh
His book "explains the ten articles of the open source definition,
clarifies the principles of open source software development and licensing,
and offers advice on drafting open source licenses.
He demonstrates how the current default laws support and
reinforce the fundamental appropriateness 
of using the open source business model in the context of software
development, addresses the legality of binding licensees to
software licenses that are posted on web sites,
and outlines the rules of dual licensing schemes."
(quoting an annotation from Book News, Inc., Portland, OR (booknews.com),

There are lots of interesting legal points here!
But what's concerning about this book is that here's a smart lawyer who
will happily explain to other lawyers how to draft new FLOSS licenses.
All by itself that's fine - 
sometimes you need to do that, and lawyers telling other lawyers
how to do that is reasonable enough.
But what concerns me is that a reader might not sufficiently
understand why drafting a new FLOSS license is almost always a terrible idea.

"Linus: I think there's both a licence issue, and a community and personality issue. The BSD licences always encouraged forking, but also meant that if somebody gets really successful and makes a commercial fork, you cannot necessarily join back. And so even if that doesn't actually happen (and it did, in the BSD cases - with BSDi), people can't really 'trust' each other as much.
In contrast, the GPLv2 also encourages forking, but it not only encourages the branching off part, it also encourages (and 'requires') the ability to merge back again. So now you have a whole new level of trust: you 'know' that everybody involved will be bound by the licence, and won't try to take advantage of you."

Linus: I don't actually see a whole lot of overlap, except that I think Solaris will start using more of the Linux user space tools (which I obviously don't personally have a lot to do with - I really only do the kernel). The Linux desktop is just so much better than what traditional Solaris has, and I expect Solaris to move more and more towards a more Linux-like model there.

On the pure kernel side, the licensing differences mean that there's not much cooperation, but it will be very interesting to see if that will change. Sun has been making noises about licensing Solaris under the GPL (either v2 or v3), and if the licence differences go away, that could result in some interesting technology. But I'm taking a wait-and-see attitude to that.


Q: Now that the GPLv3 has been finalised and released, do you foresee any circumstance that would encourage you to begin moving the kernel to it? Or, from your perspective, is it so bad that you would never consider it? - Peter Smith / Naveen Mudunuru.

Linus: I think it is much improved over the early drafts, and I don't think it's a horrible licence. I just don't think it's the same kind of 'great' licence that the GPLv2 is.

So in the absence of the GPLv2, I could see myself using the GPLv3. But since I have a better choice, why should I?

That said, I try to always be pragmatic, and the fact that I think the GPLv3 is not as good a licence as the GPLv2 is not a 'black and white' question. It's a balancing act. And if there are other advantages to the GPLv3, maybe those other advantages would be big enough to tilt the balance in favour of the GPLv3.

Quite frankly, I don't really see any, but if Solaris really is to be released under the GPLv3, maybe the advantage of avoiding unnecessary non-compatible licence issues could be enough of an advantage that it might be worth trying to re-license the Linux kernel under the GPLv3 too.

Don't get me wrong - I think it's unlikely. But I do want to make it clear that I'm not a licence bigot, per se. I think the GPLv2 is clearly the better licence, but licences aren't everything.

After all, I use a lot of programs that are under other licences. I might not put a project I start myself under the BSD (or the X11-MIT) licence, but I think it's a great licence, and for other projects it may well be the right one.

Q: 386BSD, from which NetBSD, FreeBSD and OpenBSD were derived, was there well before Linux, but Linux spread much more than 386BSD and its derivatives. How much of this do you attribute to the choice of the licence and how much to the development process you chose? Don't you think that the GPLv3 protects the freedom that has bred Linux better than the BSDs till now, more than the GPLv2 can? - Tiziano Mosconi from Italy.

Linus: I think there's both a licence issue, and a community and personality issue. The BSD licences always encouraged forking, but also meant that if somebody gets really successful and makes a commercial fork, you cannot necessarily join back. And so even if that doesn't actually happen (and it did, in the BSD cases - with BSDi), people can't really 'trust' each other as much.

In contrast, the GPLv2 also encourages forking, but it not only encourages the branching off part, it also encourages (and 'requires') the ability to merge back again. So now you have a whole new level of trust: you 'know' that everybody involved will be bound by the licence, and won't try to take advantage of you

This one seems to have been completely overtaken by events, and
was abandoned as a draft:

<li>
<a href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/Licensing-HOWTO.html">
Licensing HOWTO</a> (Draft 2002-11-09) by Eric Steven Raymond and
Catherine Olanich Raymond.
This is an old draft; it does not appear to be maintained
(4.5 years later, in July 2007, it's still unchanged), and
it appears that it has been superceded by events.
But it has some interesting things to say.
Under "Choosing a license", he states that:
"The first and most basic decision you need to make is: do you want
a copyleft license or not? A copyleft license requires that its terms
be propagated to derivative works...
There is a category of semi-copyleft licenses. These require that
derivative works that merge with the program be open source, but carve out
exceptions for certain kinds of closed-source module or extension...
OSI recommends that you choose from among our "Best Practice" licenses:
The Academic Free License (AFL), the Open Software License (OSL) the GNU
General Public License (GPL), and the Mozilla Public License. We have been
evaluating and thinking about licenses for years now, and we judge these
are currently best written and the legally most sound in their respective
functional categories (this evaluation may change as licensing technology
evolves)....
If you choose a copyleft license, your best-practice alternatives
are GPL or OSL. The choice between OSL and GPL is a delicate one. OSI
believes that OSL is more likely to be enforceable than GPL on strict
technical grounds; on the other hand, GPL has a large constituency, its
own advocacy organization, and lawyers with a history of successfully
enforcing compliance out of court.
If you choose a non-copyleft license, your best-practice choice is the
lightweight AFL.
If you want a semi-copyleft license, we recommend MPL. It has language
relating to liability, indemnity, and patents that is mainly relevant
to commercial corporations with intellectual-property rights of their
own to protect.
A good rule of thumb is this: if you have a legal department to keep
happy, start by trying to get them to accept AFL. If they won't, fall
back to MPL. If you don't have a legal department, go with AFL and don't
spend energy worrying about it. None of these licenses has been tested
in court, and our "best practice" category has already been filtered
by professionals for licenses most likely to stand challenge and to
protect you."
<p>
Note that this is a draft; the OSI has never made such an endorsement,
but instead later chose to categorize licenses differently, eventually
deciding that the AFL in particular
was simply a duplicate of other existing licenses.

Novell's "Help: Choosing an Open Source License"</a>.
Controversial claims (tries to convince many to avoid GPL for
legally debatable reasons instead of the MAIN reasons one would avoid the GPL).
In particular, it makes a very questionable legal claim
that simply viewing code makes it illegal to created related code.
This doesn't up to common sense; someone who has read Lord of the Rings
can still write a fantasy story.
And several U.S. districts use the Abstraction - Filtration - Comparison
test... which would be unnecessary if merely seeing code taints you.
Yes, you have to show that it's not a copy in such cases, but the
claims in this article are fanciful.
In short, it's not very helpful - doesn't really get into the
main POINT of the licenses, concentrating instead
on improbable legal theories that are unlikely to stand up in court.
Not a worthwhile source.

is basically an anti-GPL rant.
