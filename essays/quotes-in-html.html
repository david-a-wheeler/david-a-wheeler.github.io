<h1>Curling Quotes in HTML and XML</h1>
<b>by <a href="https://dwheeler.com">David A. Wheeler</a></b>,
2025-10-08 (was 2002-12-10)

<h1>Summary</h1>
<p>If you’re creating HTML or XML,
<i>use UTF-8 characters for curling quote characters</i>.
Here’s a table showing what I mean (you can copy and paste from this
table if you would like):

<table border="1" nosave="nosave">
<tbody><tr><td>Character</td><td>UTF-8</td></tr>
<tr><td>Left Double Quotation Mark (U+201C)</td><td>“</td></tr>
<tr><td>Right Double Quotation Mark (U+201D)</td><td>”</td></tr>
<tr><td>Left Single Quotation Mark (U+2018)</td><td>‘</td></tr>
<tr><td>Right Single Quotation Mark (U+2019, including English possessives and contractions)</td><td>’</td></tr>
</tbody></table>

<h1>History</h1>
<p>
I first wrote this page in 2002.
At that time many character encodings were in wide use.
A <i>character encoding</i>, if you do not know,
is a system for converting human-readable
text characters into numbers and back (so that characters can be
stored and displayed).
<p>
In 2002 the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8">UTF-8 character encoding
had been created earlier, in 1992</a>, but
UTF-8 was used by less than 1% of all web (HTML) pages.
HTML pages instead used a hodgepodge of different character encodings
including ASCII, Western European encodings like Latin-1, (shift) JIS,
Windows-1251, Windows-1252, and GB2312 among others.
The default character encoding for HTML 4.0 was ISO-8859-1, aka Latin-1,
though an HTML page could specify something different, and different they were.
It was sometimes
difficult to combine pages and fragments of pages because their
character encodings were different.
<p>
Part of this came down to tooling.
Many text editors and tools didn’t support UTF-8 natively in 2002.
The first Linux using UTF-8 by default was
<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=29748679"
>Red Hat</a> in 2002, which was a big deal at the time.
<a href="https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/112216/which-terminal-encodings-are-default-on-linux-and-which-are-most-common">Debian's default
character encoding didn't switch to UTF-8 until 2007</a>.
<p>
While this did cause many problems, the good news was that
most character encodings used ASCII as a subset.
So you could use ASCII characters to specify the <i>other</i>
characters you wanted to display.
This meant that
the safest approach to display these characters was to use
&#8220;decimal numeric character references&#8221;
for curling single and double quote characters
(these marks are called
&#8220;smart quotes,&#8221;
&#8220;curly quotes,&#8221; &#8220;curled quotes,&#8221;
&#8220;curling quotes,&#8221; or &#8220;curved quotes&#8221;).
In other words,
for left and right double quotation marks, use
&amp;#8220; and &amp;#8221; - and for
left and right single quotation marks (and apostrophes), use
&amp;#8216; and &amp;#8217;.
This approach complies with all international standards, and works
essentially everywhere.
It <i>still</i> works today, as I expected.
Thankfully, you no longer <i>need</i> to do it.
</p>
<p>
Here&#8217;s a table showing what I recommended in 2002
given that historical circumstance:

<table border="1" nosave="nosave">
<tbody><tr><td>To show</td><td>In HTML, SGML, or XML use</td><td>Displays on your system as</td></tr>
<tr><td>Left Double Quotation Mark</td><td>&amp;#8220;</td><td>&#8220;</td></tr>
<tr><td>Right Double Quotation Mark</td><td>&amp;#8221;</td><td>&#8221;</td></tr>
<tr><td>Left Single Quotation Mark</td><td>&amp;#8216;</td><td>&#8216;</td></tr>
<tr><td>Right Single Quotation Mark (including English possessives and contractions)</td><td>&amp;#8217;</td><td>&#8217;</td></tr>
</tbody></table>

<h1>What’s changed?</h1>

<p>
In short, UTF-8 is now broadly supported and used.
Over time, tools have added support for UTF-8.
The current version of HTML <i>defaults</i> to UTF-8.
Almost all HTML pages are in UTF-8.
XML supports UTF-8, too.
In 2002 I noted UTF-8, but I also noted how poorly UTF-8 was supported.
I concluded in 2002, “For now, don&#8217;t do it.”
Thankfully, things have changed for the better.
