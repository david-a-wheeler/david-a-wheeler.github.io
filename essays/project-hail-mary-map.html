<p>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Hail_Mary"
><i>Project Hail Mary</i></a> is a 2021 science fiction novel by
Andy Weir - and a really good one.
However, the book doesn't have a map of the relevant parts of space
from the book.
I think it needs a map... so here's a map.

<p>
Warning: Spoilers ahead!

<p>
The following map shows our local stellar neighborhood.
Every dot represents a rogue planet or a star system (a star system
is a star or set of stars that orbit each other,
along whatever objects like planets that orbit those stars).
For brevity, I'll call each rogue planet or star system a "stellar object".
The name of the stellar object is next to it.
Near the bottom center of the map
is our Solar System (a star system centered on our own star,
which is named Sol).
All distances in this map are measured in light-years
(the distance light travels in 1 year in a vacuum).
The directed lines show the travel of Astrophage (more about that in a moment).
<p>
Click on the map to see just the map (which will will enlarge it);
more information follows the map.

<h1 id="representation">Representation challenges</h1>
<p>
One challenge with maps of space is that space is 3-dimensional, but
printed maps are 2-dimensional.
This map shows, on a 2-D plane, the location of each object on a plane
going through the celestial equator (a plane that aligns with
the equator of the earth in 2000).
In front of every name are square brackets containing the number of
light-years the object is above or below this plane. We'll center its height on
our own Solar System (so its "height" is 0.0).
This map only shows the stellar objects between -5 and +5 light-years
of height in the celestial plane, to make the map simpler.
Here's an example that might help you understand the map:
if we added Polaris (the North Star) to this map,
we would add a dot almost on top of the Solar System and
write "[430] Polaris" to note that Polaris is 430 light-years in height.

<p>
I have made a minor
exception with Alpha Centuri, the star system closest to our own.
Alpha Centauri is a triple star system, and its star Proxima Centauri
so much closer to our Solar System compared to its other stars
Alpha Centauri A and B
that their locations are visibly different even at the scale of this map.
Thus, instead of one dot, the Alpha Centauri stellar system has two
adjacent dots, one for Proxima Centauri and the other
for the pair Alpha Centauri A and B.

<p>
<h1 id="directed_lines">Directed lines represent astrophage</h1>
<p>
The directed lines show the spread of astrophage per
pages 95-96 (all page numbers are per the hardcover 2021 release).
Centered on each directed line is the distance of that trip
(shown in italics and measured in light-years).
Note that the trip distance between each of these stellar objects
is less than the 8 light-year maximum transmission range of astrophage.
Some are close, such as the 7.8 light-year distance from Epsilon Eridani
to Sirius, but they are all less than 8 light-years.

<p>
Let's follow the directed lines.
It's eventually revealed that
Astrophage started at Tau Ceti (near the right center of this map).
Astrophage then spread to Epsilon Eridani.
It eventually ended up on Rocky's home system of 40 Eridani (per page 204),
which is on the top right of this map.
The novel doesn't expressly say it, but by
looking at the locations of stars it's almost certain that astrophage
spread from Epsilon Eridani directly to Rocky's home system of 40 Eridani.
From Epsilon Eridani it also went to Sirius, the brightest star in our sky
(in part because Sirius is relatively close to us).
From Sirius it spread to
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WISE_0855%E2%88%920714"
>WISE 0855-0714</a>
(full designation WISE J085510.83-071442.5).

<p>
<h1 id="wise">WISE 0855-0714</h1>
<p>
WISE 0855-0714 is where things get weird on this map.

<p>
WISE 0855-0714 was only discovered in April 2014 and
isn't actually a star.
Its mass is so low that it <i>can't</i> fuse any atoms like
a main-sequence star or a brown dwarf.
It's only 3-10 Jupiter masses (M<sub>J</sub>).
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_dwarf#Sub-brown_dwarf"
>Normal hydrogen thermonuclear fusion reactions
require .08 mass of the Sun</a> - so a main-sequence ("normal")
star requires at least around 89 Jupiter masses.
Its mass is even below 13 Jupiter masses, the
minimum (limiting) mass for thermonuclear fusion of deuterium
that is necessary to create a brown dwarf.
Its temperature is not like a typical star either: -48 to -13 °C (-55 to 8 °F).
Objects like these are often classified as a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sub-brown_dwarf"
>sub-brown dwarf</a>.
It could also be called a rogue planet.
It's easy to quibble about categories.
However, since it can't fuse any atoms,
it's more like a massive rogue planet than
a star in the usual sense, so that's what I'll call it here.

<p>
But could WISE 0855-0714 support astrophage reproduction?
All the other stellar objects on this journey are star systems.
It's easy to imagine that they each have a star and
at least one planet with the carbon dioxide
necessary for astrophage to reproduce.
However, WISE 0855-0714 is different! Could astrophage regain enough
energy (possibly by reproducing) to travel to other stars?
To see if this is justifiable, let's first
look at the astrophage lifecycle (primarily from pages 84-85 and 90-91):

<ol>
<li><i>Get energy</i>. This requires a temperature over 96.415 °C
(page 219),
but it's faster at higher temperatures and astrophage are basically
immune to heat (they absorb it when they aren't full and they emit the rest).
Typically this will occur on a star surface.
This will continue until they're ready to breed (aka "full" or "enriched"),
which is when it's consumed 1.5 megajoules (17 nanograms) of energy (page 97).
For some unexplained reason the process is self-limiting
once the star dims by 10% (page 95); there are many ways biological systems
might end up with such a limitation, so while unexplained
it's reasonable enough.
<li><i>Travel along a north magnetic pole</i>. This lets it find a source of
carbon dioxide (otherwise it could only see a star if it's on one).
<li><i>Search and travel towards a carbon dioxide source</i>.
This is done by looking for light at 4.26 and 18.31 microns.
In our Solar System, that source is Venus.
<li><i>Reproduce</i>. Once it's at the source of carbon dioxide (such
as Venus) it will
make a copy using its remaining energy, carbon dioxide,
and other materials available.
<li><i>Both mother and daughter travel to an energy source</i>. Say, a star.
Now the process repeats.
</ol>

<p>
So, could astrophage at WISE 0855-0714 eventually
end up at other stars?
At the very <i>least</i> this requires the astrophage to
find a location on WISE 0855-0714 with a temperature over
96.415 °C, so it can get energy.
That way, astrophage looking for an energy source (like a star) will have
one to find.
At first this looks impossible, since WISE 0855-0714's average temperature
is -48 to -13 °C.
However, averages hide a lot; in 2021 Earth's average temperature
was 14.7 °C (58.4 °F) yet the highest and lowest air temperatures
on Earth are likely more than 55°C apart
(per
<a href="https://www.climate.gov/news-features/understanding-climate/climate-change-global-temperature"
>"Climate Change: Global Temperature" by
Rebecca Lindsey and Luann Dahlman, June 28, 2022, Climate.gov</a>).
<!--
0.84 + 13.9 = 14.7 degrees C
1.41 + 57.0 = 58.4 degrees FF
-->
What's more, there are places on Earth (like lava flows) that have locations
with far higher exposed temperatures.
WISE 0855-0714 is probably a gas giant, so astrophage could simply fall
into it until it found pockets where that temperature (energy) is available.
In short, it's very plausible that it could find spots above
96.415 °C even though its average isn't that high.
What's more, astrophage would be attracted to such sources.

<p>
After astrophage fills up on energy, it will need to find a way away
from its energy source (its "star") by using a strong magnetic field.
Again, this seems plausible.
WISE 0855-0714 is likely to have a strong magnetic field.
After all, all four of our gas giants have magnetic fields.
So once it's filled with energy, it can simply follow the magnetic field
that is almost certainly present.

<p>
Could astrophage have entire reproduction cycles completely at
WISE 0855-0714?
That's important, because if it could reproduce on the rogue planet,
that would greatly increase the likelihood that it
would spread to other worlds (simply because there's more trying).

<p>
I think it's plausible that astrophage <i>could</i> reproduce
completely at
WISE 0855-0714.
The key reason is that
it's plausible that the rogue planet has carbon dioxide.
If that's true,, the rogue planet could fulfill the role of both
"star" (energy source) and "planet" (carbon dioxide source).
Any astrophage leaving the rogue planet looking for the "other role"
has a good chance of rediscovering the rogue planet.
The lack of energy on the rogue planet might encourage astrophage
looking for energy to go looking elsewhere,
as the rogue planet wouldn't "look" as much like a star, resulting
in faster spread.
It's not clear if lower-energy astrophage could make the trip to another star,
given its lack of evergy, but it might.
We know that some astrophage (likely the full energy ones)
can make the trip.

<p>
No matter what,
WISE 0855-0714 will have lower available temperatures compared to a star.
As a result, it would have taken far longer for astrophage to have gathered
energy from this rogue planet instead of its usual diet of stars.
I haven't tried to calculate that,
but I suspect it would be a <i>long</i> time depending on the
temperature available.
Perhaps it's best if we don't examine this question too closely :-).
Still, humans were able to do it, and it would have sought out energy
sources, so I think it's at least plausible.

<p>
Anyway, in the book, astrophage spreads from this rogue planet to at
least 4 other star systems:
Wolf 359, Lalande 21185, Ross 128, and our own Solar System (page 95).
The novel begins after the humans detect its effects in our own Solar System.
