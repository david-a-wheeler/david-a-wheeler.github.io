<h1 class="title">NASA Open Source Summit 2011 on Open Source Software</h1>
<h2 class="author">David A. Wheeler</h2>
<h2 class="date">2011-03-29</h2>
<p>
I gave a presentation at the
<a href="http://www.nasa.gov/open/source/">NASA Open Source Summit
in March 2011</a>
(<a href="http://www.slideshare.net/ckleclerc">presentation slides are
available online</a>).
The building itself that housed it was very small, but
I was told that there were about 300 external people who watched it
in real time, in addition to the 122 local participants.
Here's a quick summary.
<p>
I kicked off the content.
My presentation started with the U.S. Constitution's preamble, which
I knew would be unusual, but I think it was received well.
I tried to include some of my experience in open source software policy.
NASA has done lots with open source software, but as an outsider
I thought I could point out some of NASA's problems in how they
handle open source software.
For example, I think NASA's "open source agreement" (NOSA) is a disaster;
it's incompatible with every other OSS license, and even incompatible
with uncopyrighted works like the works of other U.S. government employees
as part of their official duties, because only the author can add changes
to a NOSA work.
NASA also makes it way too hard to release software as OSS.
NASA would be better off going "OSS by default" for software that
is not classified or export controlled, at <i>least</i> for the
science and research related software.
<p>
Terry Fong, NASA ARC, talked about NASA and open source software
from an insider's perspective.
NASA currently does infrequent release of completed software, with
internal development done solely by NASA workforce.
This is a problem, because it inhibits collaboration.
Copyright assignment is very time-consuming, especially with
students; each of them come from different programs, and there
are export control and intellectual rights issues too.
Under what circumstances is NOSA still useful?
What is needed for NASA to be able to use a suite of licenses
(Apache 2, GPL 3, etc.).
In Ames, they're struggling with contributions for software
that they will continue to use - how can NASA handle this so
it's a low barrier to entry?
<p>
Patrick Hogan (NASA World Wind) spoke.
He also noted problems with the NASA license, and suggested a suite
of OSS licenses instead.
World Wind is not an app, it's a plug-in; if you need a 3D world,
just plug it in.
API-centric, cross-platform, open standards.
"Facilitates innovation".
I loved his "Noise to Signal" cartoon from Rob Cottingham:
"Apparently our open API is giving our customers unprecedented
control over their own lives and allowing them to seize control
of their destinies.  What are we doing wrong?"
I whould note that
the
<a href="http://www.slideshare.net/nitot/hackability-what-it-means-why-its-important-3185086">Mozilla presentation
"Hackability - What it means, why it's important"</a>
has the slightly different ending for this cartoon's text
("So please shut it down"),
but it has the same basic idea.
<p>
I spent a lot of time talking with individuals "in the hallway" so to speak.
A lot of people agreed with me that the NASA Open Source Agreement
(NASA's vanity license) is a real problem.
I don't just want to flap my lips; I want to see change for the better.

<h1>Day two</h1>

<p>
In the next morning there was a Github presentation.
The github code itself isn't open source, but they host a number
of open source software projects.
He noted Wikipedia &mdash; a mass of unwashed masses can create
useful results.
"I can edit an article, and see when it was modified and by who...
and Wikipedia is very active at fighting vandalism".
Wikipedia is primarily used to <i>read</i>.
Jimmy Wales says that a very small group of people (0.12%) actually write
most of the material, and it's then available for all
(that's still a lot of people editing).
Peer review on an insane scale is what helps them get their quality.
"Github is a lot like Wikipedia"; there's mass peer review.
For github, we don't care what is hosted;
they intended for it for software, but books (e.g. "Pro Git")
and recipes are there too.
"We're interested in collaboration".
He went over the basics of github;
people can create changes, comment on someone's
changes (kicking off a discussion),
and send a "pull request" so that someone else can pull in a change.
"We force you to fork" (I don't like that use of the word fork;
I think that's misleading.  Every proposed change is a fork in that sense,
whether you're using distributed system or not.).
Github has a nice graphical display;
the rows are individual developers, every dot is a change
(pulled or not), and arrows show forks and pulls.
Homebrew has 2,000 current forks; many are temporary.
Erlang existed in 80s, made open source in 88,
but when moved to github they got 500% more contributions
("lots more contributions due to this social model, and use a common
website").
Github now adds 3,000+ new projects daily.

<p>
Chris diBona of Google talked about OSS.
Google crawled across the whole Internet looking for OSS software and their
liceses; they crawled 31M files across whole Internet, and after
de-duping files, they found the following license use
(in order of commonality):
GPL 47.06%, LGPL 22.64%, BSD 13.45%, Apache 5.64%,
MIT 4.96%, Mozilla 1.80%, Perl 1.06%.
Again the GPL and LGPL are most common, though when measured
per file the GPL and LGPL are somewhat less common than when
doing per-project statistics I often use
(which makes sense; when you combine GPL and other licenses
into a larger project, the reported license is often the GPL).
He claimed that
"Everything is developed using OSS somewhere" such as
by using gcc.
"You don't have a choice to not use OSS, that'd be foolish."
Google when it first started used Linux, settled on Linux.
Google today has its own motherboards but commodity hardware, running Linux;
enabled capacity.
Google uses OSS as infrastructure (Linux kernel, many Apache project tools,
ssh, languages/compilers, etc.), and as building blocks
(hundreds of libraries).
Google uses OSS for:
control and ownership
("maintain our independence from external software companies"),
adaptability and flexibility ("can drill down to repair and
enhance our services, can do something out of the ordinary, no one is
incentivized to hurt us"), and roots ("appeals to the Google ethic").
Google patches into hundreds of projects each month.
Google doesn't have its own license; Apache 2.0 license is most common,
but releases under all of the major ones (BSD, MIT, GPL, etc.).
"If you are using software today, you're probably using software
from Google."
Why NASA and OSS?
Increase speed of procurement, tech transfer to and from Aerospace,
earth and CS improvements, faster speed of implementation
(via sharing among NASA missions and the outside world).
(Chris used to work at Dept. of State.)
NASA should measure "how widely is the software (that we released) used?"
"Government should work at owning the code, before they get started,
and codify in contracting exactly what they mean;
reinforce that we expect new work, not the same thing over and over again."
Licensing/maintainance fees pay over and over for the same thing;
that's enough.
ITAR and export rules could use a re-look;
avionics and telemetry often over-constrained.
Are we being too conservative?
Software held close and dear often just dies; if you release it, you
have the potential to improve it with the rest of the world.
Google doesn't use AGPL; procedurally difficult.
The top 10 licenses are enough.
THe NOSA license isn't terrible, but no one's using it; you NASA
aren't powerful enough; it creates a ghetto of compatibility.
Google uses Apache 2.0; its patent conditions are very fair
(you can use it, but you can't use the patent if you sue us).
They use BSD for WebM, etc.
Google has to deal with ITAR all the time, they've got a good relation
with the export bodies.
The crypto process is under 3 days, very efficient.
Telemetry is a longer process (worried about missile technology).

About half of existing GPLv2 users quickly switched to GPLv3.
"We knew that GPLv3 would be successful; we were surprised how fast
the GPLv3 was adopted (within the first year)".
About half of the GPL users are GPLv2, others are GPLv3.
(The main issue for people who didn't adopt GPLv2
was the replaceability clause.)
Google's preferred OSS license is Apache 2.

<p>
There was a breakout session that discussed governance.
<!--
Nick Skyland - at OCIO, and develops code for fun on the side!
IBM has an internal Java repository.
Continuous release is difficult (policy not clear).
Write a new policy for OSS?
-->
Later on, I had a great conversation with Bryan Geurts,
chief patent counsel, NASA GTSU.
He wrote the draft of the NOSA.
We didn't agree on all points (unsurprisingly!), but I think
there was a lot of useful sharing.
One interesting note was that the concerns that led him to believe
that the NOSA was needed was all about software developed exclusively
by U.S. government employees as part of their official duties.
I still don't think it's needed (projects like VistA released
public domain software without problems), but
limiting the NOSA to only that case would be an improvement
over its widespread use.
He completely agreed that the NOSA needed to be updated;
I hope that this will happen soon.
<!--
Why should NOSA exist?
- Attribution/credit for U.S. government employees
- Indemnification vs. Warranty due to Anti-Deficiency Act

In another breakout session we discussed licencing, e.g.,
can government employees legally contribute to OSS projects?
I pointed to the
<a href="http://cio-nii.defense.gov/sites/oss/">DoD OSS policy and FAQ</a>;
although they don't formally apply to NASA, the fact
that a sibling organization was willing to make such
statements will probably help.

<p>
Mozilla presented;
the Mozilla Foundation started in 2003.
Stats: 350 paid staff in countries, 40% of code contributed by volunteers,
testing community of 60,000+, more than 400 million users.
He reported a global browser market share of about 30%.
"Hone your MacGuyver-Skills" - make it work.
Their principles:
<ol>
<li>make it superior (openstack does this too).
they succeed because the product is superior.
People want to work for something they believe in.
<li>Distribute decision-making to the edges.
(The Linux kernel is sort of a counter-example, in that there is a single
central decision-maker, but even then, most
decision-making is distributed to the edges.)
Everyone needs to have high agreement on core values,
decision-making rests with module owners.
"Mozilla is a Chaord".
<li>Communication will happen in any way possible.
Different people prefer different approaches (Skype, Wiki, etc.).
Just make sure that it's archived.
Some people use Skype, some use different mechanisms.
Blogs are pulled into the "Planet Mozilla" stream.
<li>Surprise is overrated.
Surprise is the opposite of engagement; you should be that engaged.
Grow the circle of participation.
<li>Communities are not markets... members are citizens.
Treat them as part of you.
<li>Tools matter.  They use the mercurial VCS internally.
They moved to github ($50/month), the outcome was 10x as many contributions
(even kids in high school understood how to contribute); definitely
really, really good.
</ol>

<p>
There was a close-out, noting the massive amount of participation.
There were over 1200 tweets, and lots of people interacting.
<!--
"Thank you everyone for participating".
-->
Hopefully this will be the beginning of big improvements on
how NASA uses and releases software.
