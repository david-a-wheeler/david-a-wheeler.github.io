<h1 class="title">The Waterfall Model</h1>

<p>
The
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterfall_model">“Waterfall model”</a>
for software development
is a relatively linear sequential approach for developing software.
The idea is that progress flows in largely one direction
("downwards" like a waterfall) through individual phases from conception
through later steps (such as analysis, design, and construction).
There may be <i>some</i> feedback, but the waterfall model assumes
that feedback from any one step is limited
and mostly back to only the previous step.
<p>
The waterfall model traces back primarily
to Winston Royce’s 1970 paper, "Managing the Development of Large
Software Systems".
Royce didn’t call it the “waterfall” – he called
it the “simpler method”.
But what Royce described early in his paper is clearly the waterfall model -
work progresses in a single sequence of steps, possibly with some
iteration between adjacent steps.
<p>
However, many people did not <i>read</i> Royce's paper, even if they cited it.
Royce describes the simple (waterfall) approach, but then
explains that the waterfall model is “risky and invites failure”
and that “in my experience, the simpler method has never
worked on large software development efforts”.
Indeed, he emphasizes that various changes to the waterfall model must
be applied, such as using iteration, to have a reasonable chance of
success in a larger project.
The bottom line is that
Royce recommended <i>against</i> using the simple waterfall model,
even though later authors referred to his paper when arguing <i>for</i>
using it.
<p>
I should add that in my own experience, Royce is right saying that the
waterfall model is a risky approach to software development.
In the vast majority of cases I strongly recommend against a waterfall.
A waterfall model can work well in small projects
where everything is completely known
ahead-of-time and the requirements never change, but such projects are rare.
The waterfall model <i>looks</i> simpler and more rigorous on paper, and
those are two reasons why people keep trying to use it.
But many people have failed when they try to apply it, or at least
found it to be especially costly.
In practice,
some sort of incremental or iterative approach is usually much less risky.
<p>
Unfortunately,
many people just looked at the easiest-to-read pretty figures in the paper,
and didn't notice the text that explained why the waterfall model was risky.
The text and some of the key figures are right next to each other,
on the same page!
But people still ignored the warnings.
Since many people just looked at the earlier figures,
and skipped the more complicated later figures,
they totally misunderstood Royce's paper.
This is discussed further in
<a href="http://tarmo.fi/blog/2005/09/dont-draw-diagrams-of-wrong-practices-or-why-people-still-believe-in-the-waterfall-model/">“Don't draw diagrams of wrong practices – or: Why people still believe in the Waterfall model” by Tarmo Toikkanen (2005-09-09)</a>.
<p>
Once the pictures became widespread, they became fossilized in
various organizations and standards.
For example, the US Department of Defense (DoD) developed the standards
DOD-STD-2167 (4 June 1985), later revised to
DOD-STD-2167A (29 Feb 1988), aka
"Defense System[s] Software Development".
Technically you could iterate in 2167A, but a variety of factors made
that difficult in practice.
Those standards are officially no longer required, but the practices remain.
The
<a href="https://www.acq.osd.mil/dsb/reports/2010s/DSB_SWA_Report_FINALdelivered2-21-2018.pdf">Final Report of the Defense Science Board (DSB) Task Force on the"Design and Acquisition of Software for Defense Systems" (February 14, 2018)</a>
explains that the DoD
"still largely buys and develops software developed using the slower
traditional Waterfall approach that was mostly abandoned by commercial
companies years ago."
Once something becomes entrenched, it is hard to change.

<p>
There are several lessons to be learned here:
<ol>
<li><i>Do not mindlessly follow fads.</i>
The computing field is way too interested in what's the latest trend.
For any given approach, there are pros and cons - be sure you weigh them.
The waterfall is intended for situations where the requirements can be
completely known and never change; that is not a common situation in software.
<li><i>Look at the sources and the evidence.</i>
People repeatedly cited a document that <i>refuted</i> their claims.
With the web there's even less excuse to not check claims.
Even if there's a claim, what is the evidence behind it?
It's best to check that out.
In this case, the most-cited supports <i>refuted</i> the claims.
<li><i>Newer is not better. Older is not better. Better is better.</i>
Just because something is old does not mean it is bad (or good).
Just because something is new does not mean it is good (or bad).
Evaluate each proposal on its own merits, and for your specific circumstances.
<li><i>It's all about trade-offs.</i>
Developing software is engineering (applying knowledge to build a useful
product or service).  Engineering is all about evaluating trade-offs to
make good selections for the circumstance.
<li><i>Beware of drawing diagrams of wrong practices.</i>
A picture is worth a thousand words.
But are they the right thousand words?
People will often believe the picture and ignore the words.
<li><i>Beware of figures.</i>
Since some people <i>will</i> draw diagrams of wrong practices,
be vigilant when reading figures; they can mislead.
A story is probably helpful here.
The American cargo ship SS <i>El Faro</i>
sank on October 1, 2015 in the Atlantic Ocean, leading to the death of
everyone on it, because it
unintentionally headed into a category 3 hurricane.
The
<a href="https://www.ntsb.gov/investigations/AccidentReports/Reports/MAR1701.pdf">National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB)'s report on the El Faro</a>
determined that a key cause was that the captain used
"noncurrent weather information".
The El Faro was "receiving sufficient weather information for the
captain’s decision-making regarding the vessel’s route",
but it was not used.
One system (BVS)
plotted information in a way that was visually appealing,
while another system (Sat-C) delivered the information only as text
coordinates (which they then had to manually plot).
However, the BVS data was much older, so when the hurricane changed
course, instead of avoiding danger the ship went straight into it.
</ol>
<p>
In short, beware of using the waterfall model, and try to learn from
past fads to protect yourself from the current fads.
