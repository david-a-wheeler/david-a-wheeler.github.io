<h1 class="title">Ankle Compass (North Paw): Finer resolution idea</h1>

<p>
I think the North Paw is an interesting device.
Currently, however, only 1 motor (of 8) turns on to indicate north.

<p>
Once it's calibrated, I suspect that the North Paw could express
finer angles by turning on & off the motors in varying percentages
(presuming the motors can turn on & off quickly).
Here's my idea, if you're curious.

<p>
I think two motors, by alternating how long each is activated,
could simulate an "in-between" angle. Only 1 motor would still
be on at any one time, but the resultant apparent
angle would be the weighted average:

<p><i>
Resultant angle = p*M<sub>1</sub> + (1-p)*M<sub>2</sub>
</i></p>

<p>
In this equation M<sub>1</sub> and M<sub>2</sub> are the angles of the closest motors, and
p is the percentage of time M<sub>1</sub> is active.
Solving for p:

<p><i>
p = (M<sub>2</sub> - Result) / (M<sub>2</sub> - M<sub>1</sub>)
</i></p>

<p>
Example: to report 50 degrees, that's M<sub>1</sub>=45 degrees, M<sub>2</sub>=90 degrees,
p = (90-50) / (90-45) = 40/45 = 89% for M<sub>1</sub> (45 degrees).
So you could rapidly cycle between M<sub>1</sub> and M<sub>2</sub>,
with M<sub>1</sub> getting 89% of the power,
to simulate a 50 degree angle.

<p>
A minor complication is the motor at 0 degrees.
When considered M<sub>1</sub> it is 0 degrees, and
when considered M<sub>2</sub> it is 360 degrees, so that
it can handle averaging either direction correctly.

<p>
You could probably turn on this mode after 10 minutes, to
give people time to calibrate 1 motor at a time.
