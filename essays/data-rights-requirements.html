<h1 class="title">Data Rights are More Important than Requirements</h1>

<p>
If you are in the government, and acquiring custom developed software,
I hope to convince you of this truth:
<i>data rights are more important than requirements</i>.

<p>
<h1>The problem with requirements</h1>

<p>
Of course, meeting the actual needs of users over time is paramount, since
that is the whole point of developing software for others.
However, do not make the mistake of thinking that requirements
are the same thing as actual user needs.
By "requirements" I mean a recorded representation
that attempts to identify the current user needs.
A map is not the territory, and for the same reason,
requirements are not the actual user needs.
Requirements are just a current best guess of user needs, written
down so people can review and refine them.

<p>
Yes, it's important to identify the requirements for custom software.
But there are key limitations of any written requirements, for example:
<ol>
<li>Requirements never exactly and perfectly capture the current
user needs.
Requirements in practice always omit key needs and include requirements
that are not real needs.
After decades of observation I've never seen requirements
precisely capture the actual user needs.
<li>Even if they were perfect, requirements are never understood in
exactly the same way by everyone.
Pictures, prototypes, and mathematical specification languages can help,
but they are no guarantee.
<li>Things <i>always</i> change.
Even if your requirements were perfect yesterday, today the
environment will change, or the user perceived needs will change.
</ol>

<p>
An acquisition process that presumes
that requirements are perfect, universally understood,
and will never change is typically a disaster.
Identifying requirements is important, yes, but
it is far more important to be able to make changes into the future.

<h1>Data rights are power</h1>

<p>
Data rights, aka intellectual rights or technical data rights,
are the set of rights that different parties have, including the
rights to make changes and share them with others.
A common mistake is thinking that data rights are
just legal or technical details.
They are not.

<p>
<i>Data rights are another word for power</i>.
Data rights determine who has power, and who does not.

<p>
Data rights are more important than requirements, because
adequate data rights are the necessary legal condition for supporting
requirements changes.
And as we established earlier, requirements always need to change,
for variety of reasons including error, misunderstandings, and
changing situations.

<h1>What are adequate rights?</h1>

???
<p>
By default, the federal government Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR)
and DoD FAR Supplement (DFARS)
give the government unlimited rights.
There are excellent reasons for this.

<p>
If the government pays to develop custom software, and does not have
at least "government purpose" rights, then it cannot get another
contractor to take over 

<p>
There are some in government to understand software issues, & I am
honored to have worked with some of them. Unfortunately, a vast number
of people who are charged with managing software acquisition simply do
not understand software. As a result, they make disastrous decisions
that are difficult to recover from. For example they failed to retain
unlimited rides for the government that it normally would keep.

Cannot compete, cannot change later.

It is critically important to be able to compete.

Building software is not at all like building a device. It is like
building a city. Once you have completed initial construction, you will
live in it for decades into the future. You only learn what you need
next by living in it. Whoever has the data rights has the power to make
whatever changes are necessary to that city you are living in. If you do
not have the data right you are not living in the city, you are living
in a prison cell. You cannot change anything, and you cannot escape
it. The y2k problem showed why thinking that hardware and software are
the same as such a big mistake. People thought that software last of
the same length of time at the hardware it was developed for. That's
completely nonsense. Hardware goes away when there's better hardware or
the hardware works out. Software goes away when the problem disappears
or when you can no longer maintain it. If you have the necessary rights,
you can transition it to newer technology and continue to maintain it
for your use.

Open source software.

Esau and Jacob.

DFARS 7014 better; it only requires you to determine who paid.
FAR clause requires you to predict future (you're kidding!).

You always need to consider exit costs.

There issues when using off the shelf software, but it's not quite the
same thing. The exit cost is usually transitioning to another alternative
software. But with custom software, usually the only real alternative
is to rebuild it. This creates a much larger exit cost.
