<p>
A last-minute reminder &mdash; my public defense of
<b><a href="http://www.dwheeler.com/trusting-trust/">Fully Countering Trusting Trust through Diverse Double-Compiling</a></b>
is coming up on November 23, 1-3pm.
This is my 2009 PhD dissertation that expands on how to counter the
&#8220;trusting trust&#8221; attack by using the &#8220;Diverse Double-Compiling&#8221; (DDC)
technique.
</p>

<p>
It will be at
<a href="http://www.gmu.edu">George Mason University</a>,
Fairfax, Virginia,
<a href="http://itu.gmu.edu/innovationhall/aboutih.html">Innovation Hall</a>,
room 105.

Anyone is welcome!

I&#8217;ve made a few small tweaks over the last few weeks.
I modified proof #2 to reduce its requirements even further
(making it even easier to do); I had mentioned in text that this was possible,
but now the formal proof shows it.
I also used mace4 to show that the assumptions of each proof are
consistent.
Formal proofs aren&#8217;t easy to create, or trivial to read, but the reason
I went to that trouble is to show that it&#8217;s not just my opinion
that I&#8217;ve countered the trusting trust attack&#8230; I want to show,
conclusively, that the trusting trust attack has been countered.
I know of no stronger method to show that than a formal proof.
</p>

<p>
The &#8220;trusting trust&#8221; attack
has historically been considered the &#8220;uncounterable&#8221; attack.
Nuts to that.
Now the attack can be effectively detected &mdash; and thus countered.
