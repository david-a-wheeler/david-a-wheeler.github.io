A last-minute reminder &amp;mdash; my public defense of
&lt;b&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dwheeler.com/trusting-trust/&quot;&gt;Fully Countering Trusting Trust through Diverse Double-Compiling&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
is coming up on November 23, 1-3pm.
This is my 2009 PhD dissertation that expands on how to counter the
&amp;#8220;trusting trust&amp;#8221; attack by using the &amp;#8220;Diverse Double-Compiling&amp;#8221; (DDC)
technique.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
It will be at
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gmu.edu&quot;&gt;George Mason University&lt;/a&gt;,
Fairfax, Virginia,
&lt;a href=&quot;http://itu.gmu.edu/innovationhall/aboutih.html&quot;&gt;Innovation Hall&lt;/a&gt;,
room 105.
[&lt;a href=&quot;http://itu.gmu.edu/innovationhall/images/academiciv.gif&quot;&gt;campus
location&lt;/a&gt;] [&lt;a
href=&quot;http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;amp;source=s_q&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;geocode=&amp;amp;q=38.828240,+-77.307578&amp;amp;sll=38.828258,-77.307615&amp;amp;sspn=0.011417,0.01929&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;ll=38.827539,-77.307336&amp;amp;spn=0.011417,0.01929&amp;amp;z=16&quot;&gt;Google
map&lt;/a&gt;]
Anyone is welcome!
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I&amp;#8217;ve made a few small tweaks over the last few weeks.
I modified proof #2 to reduce its requirements even further
(making it even easier to do); I had mentioned in text that this was possible,
but now the formal proof shows it.
I also used mace4 to show that the assumptions of each proof are
consistent.
Formal proofs aren&amp;#8217;t easy to create, or trivial to read, but the reason
I went to that trouble is to show that it&amp;#8217;s not just my opinion
that I&amp;#8217;ve countered the trusting trust attack&amp;#8230; I want to show,
conclusively, that the trusting trust attack has been countered.
I know of no stronger method to show that than a formal proof.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The &amp;#8220;trusting trust&amp;#8221; attack
has historically been considered the &amp;#8220;uncounterable&amp;#8221; attack.
Nuts to that.
Now the attack can be effectively detected &amp;mdash; and thus countered.
&lt;/p&gt;
