<p><a name="trusting-trust-success"><font size="+2"><b>Success on Fully Countering Trusting Trust through Diverse Double-Compiling</b></font></a></p><p></p>
<p>
My November 23 public defense of
<b><a href="http://www.dwheeler.com/trusting-trust/">Fully Countering Trusting Trust through Diverse Double-Compiling</a></b>
went well.
This was my 2009 PhD dissertation that expands on how to counter the
&#8220;trusting trust&#8221; attack by
using the &#8220;Diverse Double-Compiling&#8221; (DDC) technique.
</p>

<p>
Most importantly (to me), my PhD committee agreed that I successfully
defended my dissertation.
Whew!
As a result, I&#8217;m essentially done with my PhD.
</p>

<p>
I learned a lot about creating formal proofs using computers by
doing this dissertation.
I wanted to give the strongest possible evidence that DDC counters
the trusting trust attack, and formal proofs are the strongest
form of proof that I know of&#8230; which is why I created them.
Frankly, creating proofs was kind of fun once I knew what I was doing, but
getting there was more painful than it needed to be.
Many books are on the underlying mathematics (e.g., giving you extreme
detail about various logic systems)&#8230; which is great if you&#8217;re a
mathematician, but not so helpful if you are simply trying to
<i>use</i> the mathematics.
Some books explain how to do things by hand, but that is an
unnecessary amount of pain; one of my proofs is 30 steps long, and I
sure wouldn&#8217;t have wanted to create that by hand.
Some books seemed to assume that you <i>already</i> knew everything
the book covered, which is an odd assumption to me :-).
</p>

<p>
Here&#8217;s a trivial example: Most logic systems can prove <i>anything</i>
if you give them inconsistent assumptions.
That&#8217;s bad!
You can get rid of that problem by sending the assumptions to a
model-builder like mace4&#8230; if
it can create a model, then the assumptions are consistent.
So, make sure you send your assumptions
through a model-builder to see if your assumptions are consistent.
</p>

<p>
I&#8217;ve posted
<a href="http://www.dwheeler.com/trusting-trust/dissertation/">
detailed data from my dissertation</a>
so that people can reproduce my results.
I think it&#8217;s really important
that results be reduceable, otherwise, it&#8217;s not science.
As part of that data, I&#8217;ve included a few files
that may help potential proof tool users get started.
In particular, I&#8217;ve posted
<a href="http://www.dwheeler.com/trusting-trust/dissertation/mortal.in">prover9 input to prove that Socrates is mortal</a>, a
<a href="http://www.dwheeler.com/trusting-trust/dissertation/sqrt2.in">prover9 input to prove that the
square root of 2 is irrational</a>,
and
<a href="http://www.dwheeler.com/trusting-trust/dissertation/distinct.in">prover9 input showing
how to easily declare that terms in a list are distinct</a>.
</p>


<p>
The &#8220;trusting trust&#8221; attack
has historically been considered the &#8220;uncounterable&#8221; attack.
Now the attack can be effectively detected &mdash; and thus countered.

Anyone is welcome!

<p>
I&#8217;ve made a few small tweaks over the last few weeks.
I modified proof #2 to reduce its requirements even further
(making it even easier to do); I had mentioned in text that this was possible,
but now the formal proof shows it.
I also used mace4 to show that the assumptions of each proof are
consistent.
Formal proofs aren&#8217;t easy to create, or trivial to read, but the reason
I went to that trouble is to show that it&#8217;s not just my opinion
that I&#8217;ve countered the trusting trust attack&#8230; I want to show,
conclusively, that the trusting trust attack has been countered.
I know of no stronger method to show that than a formal proof.
</p>

<p>
The &#8220;trusting trust&#8221; attack
has historically been considered the &#8220;uncounterable&#8221; attack.
Nuts to that.
Now the attack can be effectively detected &mdash; and thus countered.

<p><a name="trusting-trust-ddc-oss"><font size="+2"><b>Trusting Trust, DDC, and Free-Libre/Open Source Software (FLOSS)</b></font></a></p><p></p>
<p>
<a href="http://www.dwheeler.com/blog/2009/11/02/#trusting-trust-dissertation">
As I noted in my blog</a>,
I&#8217;ve just released my dissertation
<a href="http://www.dwheeler.com/trusting-trust">
&#8220;Fully Countering Trusting Trust through Diverse Double-Compiling</a> (DDC).
But what does that mean for Free-Libre/Open Source Software (FLOSS)?
In short, it&#8217;s <i>fantastic</i> news for FLOSS, but to explain why that&#8217;s so,
I need to backtrack first.
</p>
<p>
The &#8220;trusting trust&#8221; attack is a nasty computer attack that involves
creating a subverted compiler in such a way that it even subverts compilers.
It was originally reported in a 1974 security evaluation of Multics,
but most people heard about it from
Ken Thompson&#8217;s 1984 Turing Award presentation
(Ken Thompson is a creator of Unix).
This attack is incredibly nasty, and what&#8217;s worse,
until now there&#8217;s been no effective countermeasure to it.
Indeed, some have claimed that it could not ever be countered, making
the whole idea of &#8220;computer security&#8221; a non-starter.
</p>
<p>
The &#8220;trusting trust&#8221; attack <i>appears</i> to be especially
devastating to FLOSS.
The problem is that with the trusting trust attack, the source code that
people review does <i>not</i> correspond to the executable that&#8217;s
actually running, and that seems to
completely torpedo the &#8220;many eyes&#8221; review that FLOSS makes possible.
The whole world could carefully review a program&#8217;s source code,
but it wouldn&#8217;t matter if the compiler turns it undetectably
into something malicious.
</p>
<p>
Thankfully, there <i>is</i> an effective countermeasure,
which I&#8217;ve named
<a href="http://www.dwheeler.com/trusting-trust">Diverse
Double-Compiling (DDC)</a>.
You can see my dissertation which explains what it is, proves that
it works, and even demonstrates it with several compilers
including GCC.
(I will be giving a
<a href="http://www.dwheeler.com/trusting-trust">
public defense of it on November 23, 2009</a>, if
you&#8217;d like to come.)
This means that source code review, such as mass review of FLOSS code,
can now actually work.
</p>
<p>
But there&#8217;s more, because there&#8217;s an interesting catch with DDC.
DDC counters the trusting trust attack, but it&#8217;s only useful for
people who have access to the compiler source code.
Fundamentally, DDC is a technique for determining if a
compiler executable corresponds with its source code,
but only people who <i>have</i> the source code can apply DDC to
see if that&#8217;s true.
What&#8217;s more, only people who have access to the source code
will find the statement &#8220;the source and executable correspond&#8221;
particularly useful.
(You could use trusted intermediaries, but this requires total trust in
those intermediaries, making such claims
far weaker than claims that <i>anyone</i> can check.)
What&#8217;s more,
DDC is actually useful beyond what we <i>normally</i> think of
as compilers, because you can redefine
&#8220;compiler&#8221; as including other parts (such as the operating system).
In that case, you can even show that the system&#8217;s executables
all correspond to their source code.
But you can <i>only</i> use DDC to counter the trusting trust attack
if you have access to the source code.
</p>
<p>
So we now have a radical change.
Now that DDC has been shown to work,
we can see that
software with available source code (including FLOSS)
has a <i>fundamental security advantage</i> over other software.
That doesn&#8217;t mean that <i>all</i> FLOSS is more secure than
<i>all</i> proprietary software, of course.
But
<a href="http://www.dwheeler.com/essays/securing-oss.pdf">FLOSS
already had a general security advantage</a> because it better
meets Saltzer &amp; Schroeder&#8217;s &#8220;Open design principle&#8221;
(as explained in their 1974-1975 papers).
Now we have an attack &mdash; the trusting trust attack &mdash;
for which <i>FLOSS has a fundamental security advantage</i>.
The time of ignoring FLOSS options, because of misplaced notions
that FLOSS cannot be as secure as proprietary software,
needs to come to an end.

<h1>Mon, 02 Nov 2009</h1>
<p><a name="trusting-trust-dissertation"><font size="+2"><b>New PhD Dissertation: Fully Countering Trusting Trust through Diverse Double-Compiling</b></font></a></p><p></p>
<p>
An Air Force evaluation of Multics, and Ken Thompson&#8217;s Turing award
lecture (&#8220;Reflections on Trusting Trust&#8221;), showed that compilers can
be subverted to insert malicious Trojan horses into critical software,
<i>including themselves</i>.  If this &#8220;trusting trust&#8221; attack goes undetected,
even complete analysis of a system&#8217;s source code will not find the
malicious code that is running.  Previously-known countermeasures have
been grossly inadequate.  If this attack cannot be countered, attackers
can quietly subvert entire classes of computer systems, gaining complete
control over financial, infrastructure, military, and/or business
system infrastructures worldwide.
</p>
<p>
Thankfully, there <i>is</i> a countermeasure to the
&#8220;trusting trust&#8221; attack.
In 2005
<a href="http://www.dwheeler.com/trusting-trust">I wrote a paper on Diverse Double-Compiling (DDC), published by ACSAC</a>, where I explained DDC and
why it is an effective countermeasure.
But some people still raised concerns.
Would DDC <i>really</i> counter the attack?
Would DDC scale up to real-world compilers?
Also, the ACSAC paper required &#8220;self-parenting&#8221; compilers &mdash;
can DDC handle compilers that are <i>not</i> self-parenting?
</p>
<p>
I&#8217;m now releasing
<b><a href="http://www.dwheeler.com/trusting-trust/">Fully Countering Trusting Trust through Diverse Double-Compiling</a></b>,
my 2009 PhD dissertation that expands on how to counter the
&#8220;trusting trust&#8221; attack by using the &#8220;Diverse Double-Compiling&#8221; (DDC)
technique.
This dissertation was accepted by my PhD committee on October 26, 2009.
</p>
<p>
On <b>November 23, 2009, 1-3pm</b>, I will be giving a
<b>public defense</b> of this dissertation.
<b>If you&#8217;re interested, please come!</b>
It will be at
<a href="http://www.gmu.edu">George Mason University</a>,
Fairfax, Virginia,
<a href="http://itu.gmu.edu/innovationhall/aboutih.html">Innovation Hall</a>,

</p>
<p>
This dissertation&#8217;s thesis is that
the trusting trust attack can be detected and effectively countered
using the &#8220;Diverse Double-Compiling&#8221; (DDC) technique, as demonstrated by
(1) a formal proof that DDC can determine if source code and generated
executable code correspond, (2) a demonstration of DDC with four compilers
(a small C compiler, a small Lisp compiler, a small maliciously corrupted
Lisp compiler, and a large industrial-strength C compiler, GCC), and
(3) a description of approaches for applying DDC in various real-world
scenarios.  In the DDC technique, source code is compiled twice: once
with a second (trusted) compiler (using the source code of the compiler&#8217;s
parent), and then the compiler source code is compiled using the result
of the first compilation.  If the result is bit-for-bit identical with
the untrusted executable, then the source code accurately represents
the executable.
</p>
<p>
Many people commented on my previous 2005 ACSAC paper on the topic.
<a href="http://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2006/01/countering_trus.html">
Bruce Schneier wrote an article on &#8216;Countering &#8220;Trusting Trust&#8221;&#8217;</a>,
which I think is one of the best independent articles describing my work
on DDC.
</p>
<p>
This 2009 dissertation significantly extends my previous 2005 ACSAC paper.
For example, I now have a formal proof that DDC is effective
(the ACSAC paper only had an informal justification).
I also have additional demonstrations, including one with GCC
(to show that it scales up) and one with a maliciously corrupted compiler
(to show that it really does detect them in the real world).
The dissertation is also more general; the ACSAC paper only considered
the special case of a &#8220;self-parenting&#8221; compiler,
while the dissertation eliminates that assumption.
</p>
<p>
So if you&#8217;re interested in countering the &#8220;trusting trust&#8221; attack,
please take a look at my
<a href="http://www.dwheeler.com/trusting-trust/">work on countering trusting trust through diverse double-compiling (DDC)</a>.
