<a href="http://www.dwheeler.com/blog/2009/11/02/#trusting-trust-dissertation">
As I noted in my blog</a>,
I&#8217;ve just released my dissertation
<a href="http://www.dwheeler.com/trusting-trust">
&#8220;Fully Countering Trusting Trust through Diverse Double-Compiling</a> (DDC).
But what does that mean for Free-Libre/Open Source Software (FLOSS)?
In short, it&#8217;s <i>fantastic</i> news for FLOSS, but to explain why that&#8217;s so,
I need to backtrack first.
</p>
<p>
The &#8220;trusting trust&#8221; attack is a nasty computer attack that involves
creating a subverted compiler in such a way that it even subverts compilers.
It was originally reported in a 1974 security evaluation of Multics,
but most people heard about it from
Ken Thompson&#8217;s 1984 Turing Award presentation
(Ken Thompson is a creator of Unix).
This attack is incredibly nasty, and what&#8217;s worse,
until now there&#8217;s been no effective countermeasure to it.
Indeed, some have claimed that it could not ever be countered, making
the whole idea of &#8220;computer security&#8221; a non-starter.
</p>
<p>
The &#8220;trusting trust&#8221; attack <i>appears</i> to be especially
devastating to FLOSS.
The problem is that with the trusting trust attack, the source code that
people review does <i>not</i> correspond to the executable that&#8217;s
actually running, and that seems to
completely torpedo the &#8220;many eyes&#8221; review that FLOSS makes possible.
The whole world could carefully review a program&#8217;s source code,
but it wouldn&#8217;t matter if the compiler turns it undetectably
into something malicious.
</p>
<p>
Thankfully, there <i>is</i> an effective countermeasure,
which I&#8217;ve named
<a href="http://www.dwheeler.com/trusting-trust">Diverse
Double-Compiling (DDC)</a>.
You can see my dissertation which explains what it is, proves that
it works, and even demonstrates it with several compilers
including GCC.
(I will be giving a
<a href="http://www.dwheeler.com/trusting-trust">
public defense of it on November 23, 2009</a>, if
you&#8217;d like to come.)
This means that source code review, such as mass review of FLOSS code,
can now actually work.
</p>
<p>
But there&#8217;s more, because there&#8217;s an interesting catch with DDC.
DDC counters the trusting trust attack, but it&#8217;s only useful for
people who have access to the compiler source code.
Fundamentally, DDC is a technique for determining if a
compiler executable corresponds with its source code,
but only people who <i>have</i> the source code can apply DDC to
see if that&#8217;s true.
What&#8217;s more, only people who have access to the source code
will find the statement &#8220;the source and executable correspond&#8221;
particularly useful.
(You could use trusted intermediaries, but this requires total trust in
those intermediaries, making such claims
far weaker than claims that <i>anyone</i> can check.)
What&#8217;s more,
DDC is actually useful beyond what we <i>normally</i> think of
as compilers, because you can redefine
&#8220;compiler&#8221; as including other parts (such as the operating system).
In that case, you can even show that the system&#8217;s executables
all correspond to their source code.
But you can <i>only</i> use DDC to counter the trusting trust attack
if you have access to the source code.
</p>
<p>
So we now have a radical change.
Now that DDC has been shown to work,
we can see that
software with available source code (including FLOSS)
has a <i>fundamental security advantage</i> over other software.
That doesn&#8217;t mean that <i>all</i> FLOSS is more secure than
<i>all</i> proprietary software, of course.
But
<a href="http://www.dwheeler.com/essays/securing-oss.pdf">FLOSS
already had a general security advantage</a> because it better
meets Saltzer &amp; Schroeder&#8217;s &#8220;Open design principle&#8221;
(as explained in their 1974-1975 papers).
Now we have an attack &mdash; the trusting trust attack &mdash;
for which <i>FLOSS has a fundamental security advantage</i>.
The time of ignoring FLOSS options, because of misplaced notions
that FLOSS cannot be as secure as proprietary software,
needs to come to an end.
