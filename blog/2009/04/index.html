<p><a name="damage-limits-dont-harm-floss"><font size="+2"><b>Why copyright damage limits don&#8217;t hurt FLOSS</b></font></a></p><p></p>
<p>
There&#8217;s a move afoot to argue that copyright infringement penalties should
bear a rational relationship to the value of what was infringed.
You <i>might</i> think that this could harm Free/Libre/Open Source Software
(FLOSS), but I don&#8217;t think so.  
Here&#8217;s why.
</p>
<p>
First: This is all being brought to a head by the
current file-sharing lawsuit against Boston University graduate student
Joel Tenenbaum, which raises a number of interesting questions.
One issue that I find particularly interesting is the issue of
statutory damages:
Are fines from $750 to $150,000 per song (worth at most $1),
non-commercially shared without permission, even legal under the
US Constitution?
Or, are these fines so excessive that they are unconstitutional?
<a href="http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/news/2009/03/obama-admin-nothing-wrong-with-statutory-damages.ars">
Ars Technical gives a brief summary of the case</a>, if you haven&#8217;t
been following it.
The
<a href="http://beckermanlegal.com/pdf/?file=/Lawyer_Copyright_Internet_Law/sony_tenenbaum_090320FSFAmicusBrief.pdf">
Free Software Foundation (FSF)&#8217;s
Amicus Brief in Connection with defendant&#8217;s motion to dismiss on grounds of unconstitutionality
of copyright act statutory damages as applied
to infringement of single MP3 files</a>
argues that these penalties grossly exceed the crime;
the FSF argues that the
&#8220;State Farm/Gore due process test applicable to punitive damage awards
is likewise applicable to statutory damages, and in particular bars
the suggestion that each infringement of an MP3 file having a retail value
of 99 cents or less may be punishable by statutory damages of
from $750 to $150,000 &#8212; or from 2,100 to 425,000 times the actual damages&#8221;.
</p>
<p>
Frankly, I think the FSF and Tenenbaum have a reasonable argument on this point.
People who shoplift a CD from a store would definitely pay penalties when
caught, but those penalties would bear some relationship to the value of the
property stolen, and would be <i>far</i> smaller than a file-sharer.
This notion that the &#8220;punishment should fit the crime&#8221; is certainly not new;
Proverbs 6:30-31 talks about thieves paying sevenfold if they are caught.
That doesn&#8217;t make such actions <i>right</i> - but unjust 
penalties aren&#8217;t right either.
I think a lot of the problem is that copyright laws were originally
written when only rich people with printing presses could really
make and distribute many copies of material.
Today,
8-year-olds can distribute as much information as the New York Times, and
the law hasn&#8217;t caught up.
</p>
<p>
But does the FSF risk subverting Free/Libre/Open Source Software (FLOSS)
by making this argument?
After all, FLOSS developers also depend on copyright law to enforce
certain conditions, and often charge $0 for copies of their software.
If the penalties would be limited to &#8220;7 times the original cost&#8221;,
would that make FLOSS development impossible?
</p>
<p>
I don&#8217;t think there&#8217;s any problem, but for some people that may not be obvious.
The difference is that in a typical music copyright infringement case,
the filesharer <i>could</i> purchase the right to do what they&#8217;re doing for
a relatively low price, something typically <i>not</i> true for FLOSS.
For example, under normal circumstances
it&#8217;s perfectly legal to buy a song for $1, and then transfer that
song to someone else (as long as you destroy your own copies),
so sharing that song with 10 people is legal after paying $10.
</p>
<p>
In contrast, violations of FLOSS licenses often can&#8217;t be made
legal by simply buying the rights.
If you violate the revised BSD license by removing all credits to the
original author, there&#8217;s typically no &#8220;alternative&#8221; legal
version available for sale without the author credits.
(Indeed, under legal systems with strict &#8220;moral rights&#8221; it may not even be
possible.)
Similarly, if you violate the GPL by releasing binary software yet
refusing to release its source code,
there&#8217;s often no way to pay additional money
to the original authors for that privilege.
In <i>some</i> cases, GPL&#8217;ed software is released via a dual-use license
(e.g., &#8220;GPL or proprietary&#8221;), with the proprietary version costing additional
money; in <i>those</i> cases you <i>do</i> have a
value that you can compare against.
In cases where there <i>is</i> a value you can compare against, then
you should use that value to help determine the penalty.
Otherwise, a much stiffer penalty is justified, because there is no
method for the infringer to &#8220;buy&#8221; his or her way out, and their
actions risk making functional products (not just entertainment) unsupportable.
As noted in the
<a href="http://www.cafc.uscourts.gov/opinions/08-1001.pdf">
United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit case 2008-1001,
JACOBSEN v. KATZER</a>,
the court essentially
found that failing to obey the conditions of an open source software
license led to copyright infringement.
(For more on this particular case,
see <a href="http://lawandlifesiliconvalley.blogspot.com/2007/08/new-open-source-legal-decision-jacobsen.html">New Open Source Legal Decision: Jacobsen &amp; Katzer and How Model Train Software Will Have an Important Effect on Open Source Licensing</a>.)
</p>
<p>
So I think that it <i>does</i> make sense to limit copyright
penalties based on the value of the original infringed item&#8230; but
that doing so does not (necessarily) put FLOSS development processes
at risk.

<p><a name="microsoft-encarta-wikipedia"><font size="+2"><b>Microsoft loses to Open Source Approaches (Encarta vs. Wikipedia)</b></font></a></p><p></p>
<p>
The competition is over.
On one side, we have Microsoft, a company with a market value of about
$166 billion (<a href="http://quotes.nasdaq.com/asp/SummaryQuote.asp?symbol=MSFT&selected=MSFT">according to a 2009-04-20 NASDAQ quote</a>).
On the other side, we have some volunteers who work together
and share their results on the web using open source approaches.
</p>
<p>
And Microsoft lost.
</p>
<p>
As pointed out by
<a href="http://education.zdnet.com/?p=2328">
Chris Dawson (ZDNet)</a>,
<a href="http://www.pcpro.co.uk/blogs/2009/04/02/why-ill-miss-microsoft-encarta/">Mike Jennings (PC Pro)</a>,

Naomi Alderman (the Guardian)</a>,
<a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/03/30/microsoft-encarta-dies-after-long-battle-with-wikipedia/">Noam Cohen (NY Times)</a>,
<a href="http://mashable.com/2009/03/30/microsoft-encarta-to-close/">Adam
Ostrow (Mashable)</a>,
and many others,
Microsoft Encarta (Microsoft&#8217;s encyclopedia project) has folded,
having failed to compete with
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org">Wikipedia</a>.
It&#8217;s not even hard to see why:
<ol>
<li>Wikipedia is cheaper than Encarta (no-cost vs. cost)</li>
<li>Wikipedia is easier to start using. If you have a web browser,
you have Wikipedia.
In contrast, you have to specially install Encarta, and it does not
work on all platforms.</li>
<li>Wikipedia is more up-to-date than Encarta.
It often took years before Encarta entries got updated, even on trivially
obvious issues such as death dates.</li>
<li>Wikipedia has far more material.  Wikipedia has far more articles,
and generally it has far more material in each article.</li>
<li>Wikpedia&#8217;s material has fewer legal restrictions, so
users are allowed to do more with Wikipedia results.
Creating mash-ups and reposting portions is part of today&#8217;s world.</li>
</ol>
</p>
<p>
One lesson to be learned here
is that it sometimes doesn&#8217;t matter how large a company is;
changes in technology may mean that they may abandon something in the future.
Plan that the future will change, even if a company seems invincible.
It&#8217;s easy to pick on Microsoft here, but the same can be said of
IBM, or Oracle, or anyone else.
Tying yourself completely to any one company is, in the long term,
a mistake.
Thus, you need to have a reasonable escape plan
if a company folds or stops supporting a product that you depend on.
</p>
<p>
Another lesson to be learned here is that proprietary approaches
can be beaten by open source approaches.
That doesn&#8217;t mean it must happen every time, of course.
But clearly open source approaches can, at least sometimes,
dominate their proprietary competition.
</p>
<p>
In the long term,
it simply doesn&#8217;t matter if a company has more money
if an open-sourced
competitor can produce a better product, make it available at a lower cost,
and can sustain that process indefinitely.
Given those three factors, proprietary vendors
will lose to an open-sourced competitor
unless there&#8217;s a key differentiator
that is <i>sufficiently valuable to users</i>.
In such cases, <i>having</i> more money is just an opportunity to
<i>lose</i> more money; it gives no benefit of scale.
Microsoft&#8217;s Encarta team tried to compete by adding special materials
(like fancy graphics and sound).
I&#8217;m sure that Encarta managers convinced themselves that because they
were spending money to develop these materials, that users would pay for
Encarta instead.
They were wrong.
In the end, users were more interested in good, timely
information than in fancy graphics, and
Encarta simply didn&#8217;t have a chance.
Open source approaches were simply better at providing the encyclopedia
people wanted than proprietary approaches were.
</p>
<p>
The obvious question to me is, are there any lessons
that apply to software too?
Wikipedia uses free / libre / open source software (FLOSS) principles,
but Wikipedia is an encyclopedia not a FLOSS program.
Indeed, software is different than encyclopedias in many ways, for example,
people can easily switch encyclopedias
(while the lock-in and network effects of software are well-known), and
far more people can participate in encyclopedia development than in
software development.
But I still think there are lessons to be learned here.
This Encarta vs. Wikipedia battle
should make it clear that no proprietary company &mdash; no
matter how well-resourced it is &mdash; is invulnerable to
open source competition.
Developers of products with FLOSS-like licenses give up some privileges
that the law permits them to have, and in return, they can often drastically
reduce their development costs and increase the breadth of
the result (because the development efforts can be
shared among many developers).
At a certain point, FLOSS-like projects can end up like a snowball rolling
down the hill; they gain so much momentum that even large
sums of money &mdash; or being the first &mdash; aren&#8217;t
enough to counter them.
As a result,
even proprietary companies with massive cash resources do not always win.
In summary, it doesn&#8217;t matter if you have lots of money; if your
product costs more and does less (from the user&#8217;s point of view),
you must change that circumstance, eliminate all competition, or suffer
failure of the product.

<p><a name="releasing-floss-software"><font size="+2"><b>Releasing FLOSS Software</b></font></a></p><p></p>
<p>
If you&#8217;ve written (or started to write) some
Free/Libre/Open Source Software (FLOSS), <i>please</i> follow
the time-tested community standards for releasing FLOSS software
when you want people to be able to install it from source code.
Unfortunately,
a lot of people don&#8217;t seem to be aware of what these conventions are.
This really hit me in my recent
<a href="http://www.openproofs.org">OpenProofs</a> work;
we&#8217;re trying to make it
easy to install programs by pre-packaging them, and we&#8217;ve found that some
programs are a <i>nightmare</i> to package or install
because their developers did not follow the standard conventions.
</p>

<p>
So I&#8217;ve released a brief article:
<a href="http://www.dwheeler.com/essays/releasing-floss-software.html">
<b><i>Releasing Free/Libre/Open Source Software (FLOSS) for Source Installation</i></b></a>, to help people learn about them.
For the details, I point to the
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/prep/standards/"><i>GNU Coding Standards</i></a>
(especially the
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/prep/standards/html_node/Managing-Releases.html">
release process</a> chapter) and the
<a href="http://en.tldp.org/HOWTO/Software-Release-Practice-HOWTO/"><i>Software Release Practice HOWTO</i></a>.
I also point out some of the most important conventions that will
make building and installing your software <i>much</i> easier for
your users:
<ol>
<li>Pick a good, simple, Google-able name.</li>
<li>Identify the version (using simple version numbers or ISO dates),
and include that in the release filename as NAME-VERSION.FORMAT.</li>
<li>Use a standard, widely-used, GPL-compatible FLOSS license &mdash; and say so.</li>
<li>Follow good distribution-making practice, in particular,
make sure tarballs always unpack into a single new directory named NAME-VERSION.</li>
<li>Use the standard invocation to configure, build, and install it:
<tt>./configure; make; make install</tt>.</li>
<li>Support the standard <tt>./configure</tt> options like &#8212;prefix,
&#8212;exec-prefix, &#8212;bindir, &#8212;libdir, and so on.</li>
<li>Create a makefile that can rebuild everything and
uses makefile variables (including applicable
standard makefile variable names and targets).</li>
<li>Have &#8220;make install&#8221; support DESTDIR.</li>
<li>Document the external tools/libraries needed for building and running,
and make it easy to separate/reuse them.</li>
<li>If you patch an external library/tool, get the patch upstream.</li>
<li>Use standard user interfaces.
For command line tools, use &#8220;-&#8221; single-letter options, &#8220;&#8212;&#8221; long-name
options, and &#8220;&#8212;&#8221; by itself to signal &#8220;no more options&#8221;.
For GUI tools, provide a .desktop file.</li>
</ol>
