&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.apple.com/feedback&quot;&gt;
Please ask Apple to support Ogg on their iPods, iPhones, and iTunes!&lt;/a&gt;
It wouldn&amp;#8217;t hurt to also
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.petitiononline.com/appl1435/petition.html&quot;&gt;sign this
petition&lt;/a&gt;
(and maybe &lt;a href=&quot;http://jyte.com/cl/ipods-should-play-ogg-vorbis&quot;&gt;this
one&lt;/a&gt;), though I don&amp;#8217;t know how strongly they&amp;#8217;d influence Apple.
Here&amp;#8217;s why, as good news and bad news.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Bad news: Some of the most common formats for audio (like MP3 and AAC) are
patent-encumbered, and thus not
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.digistan.org/&quot;&gt;open standards&lt;/a&gt;.
Because they&amp;#8217;re patent-encumbered they are
harder and more expensive to support.
Many organizations like &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org&quot;&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;
forbid the use of patent-encumbered standards, and they can&amp;#8217;t be directly
implemented in FLOSS products used in the U.S. and some other countries.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Good news:
&lt;a href=&quot;http://xiph.org/&quot;&gt;Ogg&lt;/a&gt; (as maintained by the Xiph.org foundation)
is available!
Ogg is a &amp;#8220;container format&amp;#8221; that can contain audio, video, and
related material using one of several encodings.
Usually audio is encoded with &amp;#8220;Vorbis&amp;#8221; (the combination is &amp;#8220;Ogg Vorbis&amp;#8221;);
perfect sound reproductions can be created with FLAC.
This format is already the required audio format for Wikipedia, and
the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.0xdeadbeef.com/weblog/?p=492&quot;&gt;next
version of Mozilla&amp;#8217;s Firefox will include Ogg built in&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;a href=&quot;http://discussions.apple.com/thread.jspa?messageID=8543066&quot;&gt;
Many people already have huge music collections in Ogg format&lt;/a&gt;,
and both
&lt;a
href=&quot;http://www.marcozehe.de/2008/10/01/why-i-would-not-buy-an-ipod-just-yet/&quot;&gt;
many people report that Ogg is an important requirement for a player&lt;/a&gt;.
See my older
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dwheeler.com/blog/2008/10/02/#play-ogg-vorbis-theora&quot;&gt;
blog entry on playing Ogg Vorbis and Theora&lt;/a&gt; for more information.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Bad news: Apple&amp;#8217;s iPods do not directly support Ogg.
That&amp;#8217;s really unfortunate for iPod users, and it also makes it
harder to release files in Ogg.
So please, ask Apple to add support for Ogg.
&lt;a href=&quot;http://george.hotelling.net/90percent/digital_music/howto_how_and_why_you_would_want_to_get_ogg_vorbis_on_itunes.php&quot;&gt;People have been asking
for this for some time&lt;/a&gt;, so it&amp;#8217;s not true that
&amp;#8220;no one&amp;#8217;s asking for it&amp;#8221;.
Some people have even taken radical efforts and
&lt;a href=&quot;http://wiki.xiph.org/index.php/PortablePlayers#Apple.27s_iPod.2A&quot;&gt;
rewritten the iPod software&lt;/a&gt; - but although that shows there&amp;#8217;s a real
interest, that&amp;#8217;s an extreme measure that normal people shouldn&amp;#8217;t have to do.
There&amp;#8217;s already software available to Apple to implement Ogg
at no charge, and even the
&lt;a
href=&quot;http://gizmodo.com/archives/ogg-vorbis-on-ipod-a-rebuttal-015738.php&quot;&gt;
original iPods have enough horsepower to implement Ogg&lt;/a&gt;.
Thus, it will cost Apple very little to add support for Ogg -
and there &lt;i&gt;are&lt;/i&gt; people who want it.
&lt;/p&gt;
