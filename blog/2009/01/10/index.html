<a href="http://www.apple.com/feedback">
Please ask Apple to support Ogg on their iPods, iPhones, and iTunes!</a>
It wouldn&#8217;t hurt to also
<a href="http://www.petitiononline.com/appl1435/petition.html">sign this
petition</a>
(and maybe <a href="http://jyte.com/cl/ipods-should-play-ogg-vorbis">this
one</a>), though I don&#8217;t know how strongly they&#8217;d influence Apple.
Here&#8217;s why, as good news and bad news.
</p>

<p>
Bad news: Some of the most common formats for audio (like MP3 and AAC) are
patent-encumbered, and thus not
<a href="http://www.digistan.org/">open standards</a>.
Because they&#8217;re patent-encumbered they are
harder and more expensive to support.
Many organizations like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org">Wikipedia</a>
forbid the use of patent-encumbered standards, and they can&#8217;t be directly
implemented in FLOSS products used in the U.S. and some other countries.
</p>
<p>
Good news:
<a href="http://xiph.org/">Ogg</a> (as maintained by the Xiph.org foundation)
is available!
Ogg is a &#8220;container format&#8221; that can contain audio, video, and
related material using one of several encodings.
Usually audio is encoded with &#8220;Vorbis&#8221; (the combination is &#8220;Ogg Vorbis&#8221;);
perfect sound reproductions can be created with FLAC.
This format is already the required audio format for Wikipedia, and
the <a href="http://www.0xdeadbeef.com/weblog/?p=492">next
version of Mozilla&#8217;s Firefox will include Ogg built in</a>.
<a href="http://discussions.apple.com/thread.jspa?messageID=8543066">
Many people already have huge music collections in Ogg format</a>,
and both
<a
href="http://www.marcozehe.de/2008/10/01/why-i-would-not-buy-an-ipod-just-yet/">
many people report that Ogg is an important requirement for a player</a>.
See my older
<a href="http://www.dwheeler.com/blog/2008/10/02/#play-ogg-vorbis-theora">
blog entry on playing Ogg Vorbis and Theora</a> for more information.
</p>

<p>
Bad news: Apple&#8217;s iPods do not directly support Ogg.
That&#8217;s really unfortunate for iPod users, and it also makes it
harder to release files in Ogg.
So please, ask Apple to add support for Ogg.
<a href="http://george.hotelling.net/90percent/digital_music/howto_how_and_why_you_would_want_to_get_ogg_vorbis_on_itunes.php">People have been asking
for this for some time</a>, so it&#8217;s not true that
&#8220;no one&#8217;s asking for it&#8221;.
Some people have even taken radical efforts and
<a href="http://wiki.xiph.org/index.php/PortablePlayers#Apple.27s_iPod.2A">
rewritten the iPod software</a> - but although that shows there&#8217;s a real
interest, that&#8217;s an extreme measure that normal people shouldn&#8217;t have to do.
There&#8217;s already software available to Apple to implement Ogg
at no charge, and even the
<a
href="http://gizmodo.com/archives/ogg-vorbis-on-ipod-a-rebuttal-015738.php">
original iPods have enough horsepower to implement Ogg</a>.
Thus, it will cost Apple very little to add support for Ogg -
and there <i>are</i> people who want it.
