I&amp;#8217;m still giving a presentation at NovaLUG, but the
date has been changed from July 1 to July 8 (2006).
This is because July 4 is a U.S. holiday (independence day),
and there was concern that some people might not be able to come.
So it will now be July 8, 10am,
&amp;#8220;Free-Libre/Open Source Software (FLOSS) and Security&amp;#8221;.
Washington Technology Park/CSC (formerly Dyncorp),
15000 Conference Center Drive, Chantilly, VA.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This has convinced me that I need a page to help people
find when and where I&amp;#8217;m speaking, so that they don&amp;#8217;t have to
march through my blogs to get the information.
So here it is&amp;#8230;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dwheeler.com/presentations.html&quot;&gt;
Presentations by David A. Wheeler.&lt;/a&gt;
Just click on it, and you&amp;#8217;ll get the latest times, places, etc., of
where to go if you just can&amp;#8217;t find something better
to do with your life :-).
&lt;/p&gt;
