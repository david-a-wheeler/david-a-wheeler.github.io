<p>
Software patents continue to threaten the software industry in the
U.S. and some other countries.
They&#8217;re especially a threat to smaller software development
organizations and individuals (who do most of the innovating),
but even large software organizations are vulnerable.
</p>
<p>
If you&#8217;re not familiar with the problems of software patents, here&#8217;s
some information and resources to get you started.
The <a href="http://webshop.ffii.org/">FFII patented webshop</a> is a short
demonstration of why the problem is so serious &#8212; practically all
commercial websites infringe on patents already <i>granted</i> (though
not currently enforceable) in Europe.
<a href="http://www.researchoninnovation.org/softpat.pdf">
Bessen and Hunt</a> found good evidence that software patents
<i>replace</i> innovation instead of encouraging it.
In particular, they found that those who create software patents
are those who do <i>less</i> research, and the primary use of
software patents appears to be in creating a &#8220;patent thicket&#8221; to inhibit
competition.
There&#8217;s also the evidence of history; software is the only product that
can be protected by <i>both</i> copyright and patent, yet there&#8217;s
general agreement that the software industry
was far more innovative when patents were <i>not</i> permitted.
Copyright is sufficient; there&#8217;s no need for software patents, which
simply impede innovation.
Software patents were not even voted in; software patents are an example
of U.S. courts creating laws (which they&#8217;re not supposed to do).
India and Europe have (so far) wisely rejected software patents.
Some large companies (such as Oracle Corporation and Red Hat)
have clearly said that they oppose software patents, but that they
must accumulate such patents to defend against attack by others.
Some organizations are working against software patents, such as the
<a href="http://ffii.org/">FFII</a>,
<a href="http://www.nosoftwarepatents.com/">No Software Patents</a>,
and
<a href="http://lpf.ai.mit.edu/Patents/patents.html">League for
Programming Freedom</a>.
<a href="http://www.groklaw.net/staticpages/index.php?page=20050402193202442">
Groklaw has a massive amount of information on software patents</a>.
Yet currently the U.S. continues this dangerous practice, and so people are
trying to figure out how to deal with it until the practices can be
overturned.
In particular, free-libre / open source software (FLOSS) developers have
been trying to figure out how to deal with software patents, and there
has been some progress on that front.
</p>
<p>
Recently a new organization has been added to the mix: the
<a href="http://www.openinventionnetwork.com">&#8220;Open Invention Network&#8221; (OIN)
</a>.
Its website is short on details, but Mark H. Webbink&#8217;s article
&#8220;The Open Invention Network&#8221; in Linux Magazine (April 2006, page 18)
gives more information.
Webbink reports that
OIN was founded by IBM, Novell, Philips, Red Hat, and Sony, for two
distinct purposes:
<ol>
<li>&#8220;To provide a network, or commons, around Linux and Linux-related applications; and</li>
<li>To assure that the resulting, large, patent-free &#8220;safe area&#8221; remains large, safe, and patent-free.&#8221;</li>
</ol>
Joining OIN costs nothing; OIN&#8217;s
<a href="http://www.openinventionnetwork.com/press.html">November 2005
press release</a> says that joining OIN requires that the
participant agree to
&#8220;not assert its patents against the Linux operating system or
certain Linux-related applications.&#8221;
In return, the participants get
to use patents owned by OIN &#8212; some of which may not be related to
Linux or the key applications at all, but may be valuable to them.
In particular, OIN has the Commerce One patents (donated by Novell) that
cover web services, which potentially threaten anyone who uses web services.
By having a number of participants, OIN reduces the risks
of software patent lawsuits to all users and developers
of FLOSS products &#8212; whether they&#8217;re an OIN member or not.
</p>
<p>
The list of key applications considered by OIN, according to Webbink, includes
Apache, Eclipse, Evolution, Fedora Directory Server, Firefox, GIMP,
GNOME, KDE, Mono, Mozilla, MySQL, Nautilus, OpenLDAP, OpenOffice.org,
Perl, PostgreSQL, Python, Samba, SELinux, Sendmail, and Thunderbird.
Of course, it&#8217;d be nice if OIN protected everything with a FLOSS license,
not just a listed set.
Webbink says they chose to not do that because the &#8220;size of the safe area is
critical to OIN&#8217;s future.  If the commons is too narrow, it offers
little protection.  If it&#8217;s too broad, it makes it difficult for a
company to join the commons&#8230;&#8221;
Then, if someone tries to bring a patent infringment lawsuit against
any of these projects, the OIN can take various kinds of actions.
You can get more information via the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Invention_Network">
Wikipedia article on the Open Invention Network (OIN)</a>.
I suspect that even a FLOSS product that&#8217;s not on the list might
still get some protection, because a software patent claim brought
against that product might
also apply to one of the covered applications&#8230; and OIN might try
to pre-empt that.
But still, even given its many limitations, this is a step forward in
reducing risks of developers and users.
</p>
<p>
Another patent commons project for FLOSS programs is
the <a href="http://www.patent-commons.org/">Patent Commons Project</a>,
whose contributors and supporters include
Computer Associates, IBM, Novell, OSDL, Red Hat, and Sun Microsystems.
This is a much looser activity; it is simply a repository where
&#8220;patent pledges and other commitments can be readily accessed
and easily understood.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (PTO)
has had some talks about
<a href="http://developer.osdl.org/dev/priorart/">
using FLOSS as examples of prior art,</a>
as well as other ways to try to reduce the number of unqualified
yet granted patents.
I guess it&#8217;s good that the PTO is trying to prevent <i>some</i> invalid
patents from slipping through; it&#8217;s better than the current practice of
rubber-stamping massive numbers of patents that are actually illegal
(because they actually don&#8217;t meet the current criteria for patents).
It&#8217;s particularly galling that someone
can read another&#8217;s publicly-available code, get a patent,
and then sue the original creator of the code into oblivion &#8212;
it&#8217;s not legal, but those who do it aren&#8217;t punished and are
usually handsomely rewarded.
(Yes, this happens.)
How does that help advance anything?
But the notion that the PTO cannot currently look at prior art, due to its own
boneheaded rules and absurd timelines, merely shows how broken the
whole process is.
I suspect patents are worth their problems in some other industries, but
in software we&#8217;ve now thoroughly demonstrated them as a failure.
</p>
<p>
The U.S. Constitution only permits patents when they
&#8220;advance the arts and sciences&#8221;; since this is not true for
software patents, software patents need to be abolished immediately.
Still, until that happens, half-steps like OIN and getting the U.S. PTO to
reject illegal patents (for a change!) will at least reduce some
of the risks software developers face.

<p><a name="open-standards-open-source"><font size="+2"><b>Open standards, open source, and security too &#8212; LinuxWorld 2006 and a mystery</b></font></a></p><p></p>
<p>
<a href="http://www.dwheeler.com/blog/2006/03/30/#open-standards-security">As
I had previously threatened</a>,
I gave my talk on &#8220;Open Standards and Security&#8221; on April 4, 2006,
at LinuxWorld&#8217;s &#8220;Government Day&#8221; focusing on open standards.
My talk&#8217;s main message was that open standards are necessary
(in the long run)
for security, and I gave various reasons why I believe that.
I also tried to show how important open standards are in general.
In the process, a mystery was revealed, but first let me talk about
the NewsForge article about my talk.
</p>
<p>
Unbeknownst to me, there was a reporter from NewsForge
in the audience, who wrote the article
<a href="http://business.newsforge.com/business/06/04/05/2046210.shtml">
Why open standards matter</a> &#8212; and it specifically discussed my talk!
Which was pretty neat, especially since the article was very
accurate and complimentary.
I used several stories in my talk, which the reporter called
&#8220;parables&#8221;. I didn&#8217;t use that word, but I wish I had, because that&#8217;s
exactly what they were.
For example, I talked about a (hypothetical) magic food, that cost only $1
the first year and you wouldn&#8217;t need to eat anything else
for a year&#8230; but it would make all other foods poisonous to you, and there
was only one manufacturer of magic food.
I created this parable to show that complete dependency on someone else
is a serious security problem&#8230; if you&#8217;re so dependent that you cannot
switch suppliers (practically), you already have a serious security problem.
I was especially delighted that she included my key comment that my
&#8220;magic food&#8221; parable wasn&#8217;t about any particular supplier
(Microsoft or Red Hat or anyone else)&#8230;
we need suppliers, the problem comes when we allow ourselves to become
<i>dependent</i> on a supplier.
I also discussed the 1904 Baltimore fire (where incompatible firehose
couplings were a real problem), and the railroad gauge incompatibilities
in the mid-1860s in the southern U.S.
(this was a contributing factor to the Confederacy&#8217;s loss in the U.S.
Civil War).
</p>
<p>
I did find one
nitnoid about the article, which doesn&#8217;t change anything really
but is great for showing how messy and complicated real history is.
The article says that in the 1904 Baltimore fire,
none of the firetrucks from other cities could connect.
I said something <i>almost</i> like that, but not quite.
What I actually said was that firetrucks from other cities had
firehose couplings that were incompatible with Baltimore&#8217;s hydrants.
I read a lot more about this event than I could mention in my presentation,
which is why I said what I said in that funny way.
It turns out that a few firefighters did manage to jerry-rig &#8220;connections&#8221;
between some of the incompatible couplings,
by wrapping lots of hoses around the hydrants and couplings.
This is a perfect example of a &#8220;correction&#8221; nitnoid that just
doesn&#8217;t matter, because you can probably guess the result &#8212; the
jerry-rigged connections
had lots of water on the ground (around the hydrant),
and disturbingly little on the fire.
So while technically there were some &#8220;connections&#8221; to hydrants
by the firetrucks from other cities, they weren&#8217;t effective enough,
and the bottom line is just as the article indicated: Baltimore burned.
In short, the firehose incompatibilities between cities resulted
in over 2,500 buildings being lost, almost all of them unnecessarily.
I&#8217;m not sure what it says about me that I note this weird little issue,
which isn&#8217;t important at all,
but I&#8217;m sure that correcting it will require a lot of therapy.
</p>
<p>
So if you haven&#8217;t taken a look at it, take a peek at the
<a href="http://www.dwheeler.com/essays/open-standards-security.pdf">
&#8220;Open Standards and Security&#8221;</a> presentation.
I hope to eventually get an audio file posted; look for it.
When I gave the presentation I had several props to make it
more interesting, which you&#8217;ll just have to imagine:
<ul>
<li>a muffin which I claimed was &#8220;magic food&#8221;, squashed because it&#8217;s hard
to bring a muffin from DC to Boston undamaged</li>
<li>a real firehose coupling; they&#8217;re heavy,
and airport security gets real nervous when you bring them through</li>
<li>a toy railroad; I lacked the strength and space to bring a
real one :-)</li>
</ul>
</p>

<hr />
<p>
Now, on to the mystery.
</p>
<p>
One of the people at my talk made the claim that,
&#8220;today, every successful open standard is implemented by FLOSS.&#8221;
That should be easy to disprove &#8212; all I need is a counter-example.
Except that counter-examples seem to be hard to find;
I can&#8217;t find even one, and even if I eventually find one, this
difficulty suggests that there&#8217;s something deeper going on.
</p>

<p>
So as a result of thinking about this mystery, I wrote a new essay, titled
<a href="http://www.dwheeler.com/essays/open-standards-open-source.html">Open Standards, Open Source</a>.
It discusses how open standards aid
free-libre / open source software (FLOSS)
projects, how FLOSS aids open standards, and then examines this mystery.
It appears that it is true &#8212;
today, essentially every successful open standard
really is implemented by FLOSS.
I consider why that is, and what it means if this is predictive.
In particular, this observation suggests that
an open standard without a FLOSS implementation
is probably too risky for users to require,
and that developers of open standards should encourage
the development of at least one FLOSS implementation.
