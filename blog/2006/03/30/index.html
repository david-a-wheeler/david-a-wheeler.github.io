<p><a name="open-standards-security"><font size="+2"><b>Two new presentations: &#8220;Open Source Software and Software Assurance&#8221; and &#8220;Open Standards and Security&#8221;</b></font></a></p><p></p>
<p>
I&#8217;ve put two presentations on my website you might find of interest.
</p>
<p>
The first one is
<a href="http://www.dwheeler.com/essays/oss_software_assurance.pdf">
Open Source Software and Software Assurance</a>.
Here I talk about Free-Libre / Open Source Software (FLOSS) and its
relationship to software assurance and security.
It has lots of actual statistics, and a discussion on review.
I also deal with the chestnut &#8220;can&#8217;t just anyone insert malicious code
into OSS?&#8221; &#8212; many questioners don&#8217;t realize that attackers can change
proprietary software too (attackers generally don&#8217;t worry
about legal niceties); the issue is the user&#8217;s supply chain.
I gave this presentation at FOSE 2006 in Washington, DC, and I&#8217;ve
given variations of this presentation many times before.
</p>
<p>
The second presentation is
<a href="http://www.dwheeler.com/essays/open-standards-security.pdf">
&#8220;Open Standards and Security&#8221;</a>.
Here I focus on the role of open standards in security, which turns out
to be fundamental.
</p>
<p>
I&#8217;ll be giving the &#8220;Open Standards and Security&#8221; presentation at the
<a href="http://www.linuxworldexpo.com/live/12/events/12BOS06A/conference/tracksessions//QMONYA04PWRU">
&#8220;LinuxWorld Government Day: Implementing Open Standards&#8221; track</a>,
April 4, 2006, in Boston, Massachusetts.
I&#8217;ll speak at 12:45, so come hear the presentation&#8230; you&#8217;ll miss much
if you only read the slides.
