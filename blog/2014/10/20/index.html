The report
<a href="https://host-project.org/content/oss-software-government-challenges-and-opportunities">&#8220;Open Source Software in Government: Challenges and Opportunities&#8221;</a> is available to the public (you can <a href="https://host-project.org/sites/default/files/Open%20Source%20Software%20in%20Government%20-%20Challenges%20and%20Opportunities.pdf">jump to the &#8220;Download full report&#8221; link at the bottom</a>).
This paper, which I co-authored,
discusses key challenges and opportunities in the
U.S. government application of open source software (OSS).
It became publicly available only recently,
even though it was finished a while back;
I hope it&#8217;s been worth the wait.
If you&#8217;re interested in the issues of OSS and government,
I think you&#8217;ll find this report very illuminating.
