The report
&lt;a href=&quot;https://host-project.org/content/oss-software-government-challenges-and-opportunities&quot;&gt;&amp;#8220;Open Source Software in Government: Challenges and Opportunities&amp;#8221;&lt;/a&gt; is available to the public (you can &lt;a href=&quot;https://host-project.org/sites/default/files/Open%20Source%20Software%20in%20Government%20-%20Challenges%20and%20Opportunities.pdf&quot;&gt;jump to the &amp;#8220;Download full report&amp;#8221; link at the bottom&lt;/a&gt;).
This paper, which I co-authored,
discusses key challenges and opportunities in the
U.S. government application of open source software (OSS).
It became publicly available only recently,
even though it was finished a while back;
I hope it&amp;#8217;s been worth the wait.
If you&amp;#8217;re interested in the issues of OSS and government,
I think you&amp;#8217;ll find this report very illuminating.
&lt;/p&gt;
