<blockquote>
<i>A tester walks into a bar and orders a beer.
Then he orders 999,999 beers.
Orders 0 beers.  Orders -1 beers.
Orders a coyote.  Orders a qpoijzcpx.
Then he insults the bartender.</i>

<!-- That last bit is an addition from a co-worker. I reordered
them to put the numbers first, I think that's easier to follow. -->

This joke (with variations)
is making the rounds, but it also has a serious point.
It&#8217;s a nice example of how testing should work,
including software testing.
</p>
<p>
Too many of today&#8217;s so-called software &#8220;tests&#8221;
only check for correct data.
This has led to numerous vulnerabilities including
<a href="http://www.dwheeler.com/essays/heartbleed.html">Heartbleed</a>
and
<a href="http://www.zdnet.com/apples-goto-fail-tells-us-nothing-good-about-cupertinos-software-delivery-process-7000027449/">Apple&#8217;s &#8220;goto fail; goto fail;&#8221; vulnerability</a>.
The paper
<a href="https://crypto.stanford.edu/~dabo/pubs/abstracts/ssl-client-bugs.html">&#8220;The Most Dangerous Code in the World:
Validating SSL Certificates in Non-Browser Software&#8221;</a>
found that a disturbingly large number of programss&#8217;
security depends on SSL certificate validation, and they
are insecure because no one actually
tested them with invalid certificates.
They note that
&#8220;most of the vulnerabilities we found should
have been discovered during development with proper unit testing&#8221;.
</p>
<p>
Good software testing must include
<a href="http://www.dwheeler.com/essays/heartbleed.html#negative-testing">negative testing</a>
(tests with data that should be rejected)
to ensure that the software protects itself against bad data.
This must be part of an automated regression test suite
(re-run constantly) to prevent problems from creeping in later.
For example,
if your programs accept numbers, don&#8217;t just test for
&#8220;correct&#8221; input; test for wrong cases like
too big, zero, negative or too small, and non-numbers.
Testing &#8220;just around&#8221; too big and too small numbers
is often helpful, too, as is testing that tries to bypass the interface.
Your users won&#8217;t know how you did it, but they&#8217;ll know your
program &#8220;just works&#8221; reliably.
