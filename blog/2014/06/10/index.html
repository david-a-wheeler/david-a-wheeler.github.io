<p>
A new interview of me is available:
<a href="http://trustedsoftwarealliance.com/2014/06/10/david-a-wheeler-on-the-current-state-of-application-security-audio/">David A. Wheeler on the Current State of Application Security (by the Trusted Software Alliance)</a>
(<a href="https://soundcloud.com/trustedsoftwarealliance/david-wheeler-on-the-current-state-of-application-security">alternate link</a>).
In this interview I discuss a variety of topics with Mark Miller,
including the need for education in developing secure software,
the need to consider security thoughout the lifecycle,
and the impact of componentization.
I warn that many people do not include security
(including software assurance) when they ask for quality;
while I agree in principle that security is generally part of quality, in
practice you have to specifically <i>ask</i> for security
or you won&#8217;t get it.
