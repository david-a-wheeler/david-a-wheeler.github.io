A new interview of me is available:
&lt;a href=&quot;http://trustedsoftwarealliance.com/2014/06/10/david-a-wheeler-on-the-current-state-of-application-security-audio/&quot;&gt;David A. Wheeler on the Current State of Application Security (by the Trusted Software Alliance)&lt;/a&gt;
(&lt;a href=&quot;https://soundcloud.com/trustedsoftwarealliance/david-wheeler-on-the-current-state-of-application-security&quot;&gt;alternate link&lt;/a&gt;).
In this interview I discuss a variety of topics with Mark Miller,
including the need for education in developing secure software,
the need to consider security thoughout the lifecycle,
and the impact of componentization.
I warn that many people do not include security
(including software assurance) when they ask for quality;
while I agree in principle that security is generally part of quality, in
practice you have to specifically &lt;i&gt;ask&lt;/i&gt; for security
or you won&amp;#8217;t get it.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This interview is part of their
&lt;a href=&quot;http://trustedsoftwarealliance.com/category/50-in-50-interviews/&quot;&gt;50 in 50 interviews&lt;/a&gt; series, along with
Joe Jarzombek (Department of Homeland Security),
Steve Lipner (Microsoft),
Bruce Schneier,
Jeff Williams (Aspect Security and OWASP),
and many others.
It was an honor and pleasure to participate, and I hope you enjoy the results.
&lt;/p&gt;
