The year 2014 has not been a good year for the SSL/TLS protocol.
SSL/TLS is the fundamental algorithm for securing web applications.
Yet every major implementation has had at least one
disastrous vulnerability, including
Apple (<a href="http://www.dwheeler.com/essays/apple-goto-fail.html">goto fail</a>),
GnuTLS,
OpenSSL (<a href="http://www.dwheeler.com/essays/heartbleed.html">Heartbleed</a>),
and Microsoft.
Separately a nasty attack has been found in the underlying
SSLv3 protocol
(<a href="http://www.dwheeler.com/essays/poodle-sslv3.html">POODLE</a>).
But instead of just noting those depressing statistics, we
need to figure out <i>why</i> those vulnerabilities happened,
and <i>change</i> how we develop software to prevent them
from happening again.
</p>
<p>
To help, I just released
<a href="http://www.dwheeler.com/essays/apple-goto-fail.html">The Apple goto fail vulnerability: lessons learned</a>, a paper that is similar to my
previous papers that focuses on
<i>how to counter these kinds of vulnerabilities
in the future</i>.
In many ways Apple goto fail vulnerability was much more embarassing
compared to Heartbleed; the goto fail vulnerability was
<i>easy</i> to detect, in a portion that was a <i>key</i> part of its
functionality.
This vulnerability was reported back in February 2014, but there
does not seem to be a single place where you can find a more complete
list of approaches to counter it.
I also note some information that doesn&#8217;t seem to
be available elsewhere.

<p>
So if you develop software - or manage people who do - take
a look at
