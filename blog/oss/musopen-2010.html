<a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/Musopen/record-and-release-free-music-without-copyrights">Musopen is raising money to record and
release music</a>.
The result will be a (bigger) library of copyright free music.
They &#8220;want your help to hire an internationally renowned orchestra
to record and release the rights to: the Beethoven, Brahms, Sibelius,
and Tchaikovsky symphonies.
We have price quotes from several orchestras and are
ready to hire one, pending the funds&#8230; [please]
Donate, and vote on what we should buy with the money.
Then we will release that music in lossless quality
with a creative commons license&#8221;.
</p>
<p>
The entire <a href="http://www.musopen.com/">Musopen project</a>
is a very cool idea.
As they say,
&#8220;We aim to record or obtain recordings that have no copyrights so that
our visitors may listen, re-use, or in any way enjoy music. Put simply,
our mission is to set music free&#8221;.
</p>
<p>
This particular fund-raiser is also an interesting use of the
<a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/">Kickstarter web site</a>.
I can see this kind of fund-raising being done to release other
creative works, too.
For example, I can easily see projects
ransoming software so it can be released as open source software
(this happened with Blender).
I think it&#8217;s easily possible that we will see more of this in the future,
where people&#8217;s money is combined together to release artistic and
creative works in ways that eliminate constant tolls and
enable further creativity.
