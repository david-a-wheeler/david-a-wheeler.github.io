<p>
Earlier this month I gave a presentation about
open source software (aka OSS, Free Software, or FLOSS)
at a conference near Washington, DC.
You can now download the
<a href="http://www.dwheeler.com/essays/oss_200703.pdf">March 2007
presentation &#8220;Open Source Software&#8221; in PDF format</a>; you can also get it in
<a href="http://www.dwheeler.com/essays/oss_200703.odp">OpenDocument
format</a>.
For the OpenDocument version, make sure you
<a href="http://www.dwheeler.com/#corefonts">have the fonts you need</a>.
Those are just the slides; I&#8217;ve separately made the
audio available in several formats:
<a href="http://www.dwheeler.com/multimedia/oss_200703.ogg">[OGG (Vorbis)]</a>,
<a href="http://www.dwheeler.com/multimedia/oss_200703.mp3">[MP3]</a>, and
<a href="http://www.dwheeler.com/multimedia/oss_200703.flac">[FLAC]</a>.
You should be able to understand the presentation just from the audio,
but looking at the slides while listening to the audio is even better.
For the audio,
I recommend using the Ogg Vorbis format - it&#8217;s the smallest file, and it
has very good quality.
The FLAC format is lossless, and is useful for recoding later
(it&#8217;s much smaller than WAV or AIFF while still not losing anything).
The MP3 format is useful if your player can&#8217;t handle Ogg Vorbis yet
(complain to your manufacturer!) - while MP3 is an ISO standard, MP3 isn&#8217;t
an open standard because it&#8217;s patent-encumbered.

The conference was titled
&#8220;Open Source - Open Standards - Open Architecture&#8221;, and was put on
by the non-profit
<a href="http://afei.org">Association for Enterprise Integration (AFEI)</a>
(a member of the <a href="http://ndia.org">NDIA</a> family of associations).
A lot of people were particularly surprised to learn that
essentially all open source software (FLOSS) are commercial
off-the-shelf (COTS) software, a point I make in more detail in
my essay
<a href="http://www.dwheeler.com/essays/commercial-floss.html">&#8216;Commercial&#8217; is not the opposite of Free-Libre / Open Source Software (FLOSS)</a>.
Basically, the U.S. government&#8217;s own laws (particularly Title 10 section 101) and regulations (particularly the Federal Acquisition Regulation)
make it clear that nearly all open source software is
commercial off-the-shelf (COTS).
There are two kinds of COTS software products: proprietary software and
open source software.
