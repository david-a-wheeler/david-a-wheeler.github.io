<p>The U.S. Department of Defense
(DoD) has changed one of its key software development documents,
making it <i>even clearer</i> that it&rsquo;s okay to use open source
software (OSS) in the DoD.
This is good news beyond the DoD; if the US DoD can widely accept OSS, then
maybe other organizations (that <i>you</i> deal with) can too.</p>

<p>That key document has the long title
&ldquo;Application Security &amp; Development (AppDev) Security
Technical Implementation Guide (STIG),&rdquo; aka the AppDev
STIG.&nbsp;
The AppDev STIG includes some guidelines for how to write secure software,
and a checklist for use before you can deploy custom software in certain cases.
In the past, many people thought that using OSS in the
DoD required special permission, because they misunderstood some of
DoD&rsquo;s policies, and this misunderstanding had crept into the
AppDev STIG.&nbsp; The good news is that this has been fixed.
</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s the basic background.</p>

<p>Open source software (OSS) is software where
anyone can read, modify, and redistribute the source code (its
&ldquo;blueprints&rdquo;) in original or modified form.&nbsp; OSS
is widely used and developed in industry; some popular OSS includes
the Linux kernel (the basis of Google&rsquo;s Android), the Firefox
web browser, and Apache (the world&rsquo;s most popular web
server).&nbsp; You can get quantitative numbers about OSS at
<a href=
"http://www.dwheeler.com/oss_fs_why.html">http://www.dwheeler.com/oss_fs_why.html</a>.&nbsp;
There is a lot of high-quality OSS, and OSS is often very
inexpensive even when you include installation, training, and so on.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, previous versions of the AppDev
STIG were often interpreted as saying that using OSS required
special permission.&nbsp; This document matters; DoD Directive
(DoDD) 8500.01E requires that &ldquo;all IA and IA-enabled IT
products incorporated into DoD information systems shall be
configured in accordance with DoD-approved security configuration
guidelines&rdquo; and tasks DISA to develop the STIGs.&nbsp;
It&rsquo;s often difficult to get systems fielded unless they meet
the STIGs.</p>

<p>AppDev STIG version 3 revision 1 (an older
version) said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
(APP2090.1: CAT II) &ldquo;The Program Manager will obtain DAA
acceptance of risk for all <b>open source</b>, public domain,
shareware, freeware, and other software products/libraries with no
warranty and no source code review capability, but are required for
mission accomplishment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
(APP2090.2: CAT II): &ldquo;The Designer will document for DAA
approval all <b>open source,</b> public domain, shareware,
freeware, and other software products/libraries with limited or no
warranty<b><u>,</u></b> but are required for mission
accomplishment.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Many people interpreted this as saying that
any use of OSS required special permission.&nbsp; But where would
the Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA), the author of the
AppDev STIG, get that idea?&nbsp; Well, it turns out that this is a
common misunderstanding of DoD policy.&nbsp; DoD Instruction
8500.2, February 6, 2003 has a control called &ldquo;DCPD-1 Public
Domain Software Controls&rdquo; (<a href=
"http://www.dtic.mil/whs/directives/corres/pdf/850002p.pdf">http://www.dtic.mil/whs/directives/corres/pdf/850002p.pdf</a>),
which starts with this text:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="Quotation">Binary or machine executable public domain
software products and other software products with limited or no
warranty such as those commonly known as freeware or shareware are
not used in DoD information systems unless they are necessary for
mission accomplishment and there are no alternative IT solutions
available.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A lot of people stopped reading there; they
saw that &ldquo;freeware&rdquo; required special permission, and
since OSS can often be downloaded for free, they presumed that all
OSS was &ldquo;freeware.&rdquo;&nbsp; They should have kept
reading, because it then goes on to make it clear that OSS is not
freeware:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="Quotation">Such products are assessed for information
assurance impacts, and approved for use by the DAA. The assessment
addresses the fact that such software products are difficult or
impossible to review, repair, or extend, given that the Government
does not have access to the original source code and there is no
owner who could make such repairs on behalf of the Government&#8230;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This latter part makes it clear that software
only requires special treatment if the government cannot review,
repair, or extend the software.&nbsp; If the government can do
these things, there&rsquo;s no problem, and by definition OSS
provides these rights.&nbsp; But a lot of people didn&rsquo;t
understand this.</p>

<p>This was such a common misunderstanding that
in October 2009, the DoD CIO&rsquo;s memo &ldquo;Clarifying
Guidance Regarding Open Source Software (OSS)&rdquo; specifically
stated (in Attachment 2, 2c) that this was a misunderstanding
(<a href=
"http://dodcio.defense.gov/sites/oss/2009OSS.pdf">http://dodcio.defense.gov/sites/oss/2009OSS.pdf</a>).&nbsp;
The DoD CIO later instructed DISA to update the AppDev STIG so this
misunderstanding would be removed.</p>

<p>The latest AppDev STIG (Version 3, Release 4)
has just fixed this (<a href=
"http://iase.disa.mil/stigs/app_security/app_sec/app_sec.html">http://iase.disa.mil/stigs/app_security/app_sec/app_sec.html</a>).&nbsp;
The new STIG:</p>
<ol>
<li>Refers to the DoD OSS policy of 2009, instead
of the old one.</li>
<li>Has better definitions for software types,
including &#8220;OSS&#8221; and &#8220;commercial software&#8221;.&nbsp; Its old
definitions caused problems for OSS use; the &#8220;commercial software&#8221;
definition was even inconsistent with US law, the
Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), and the
DoD FAR Supplement (DFARS).&nbsp; In particular,
it makes it clear that most OSS is
commercial software as defined by law and regulation.</li>
<li>Makes it clear that special DAA approval is
ONLY required if BOTH of the following are true:&nbsp; &#8220;(1) no
source code to review, repair, and extend, and (2) limited or no
warranty, but are required for mission accomplishment.&#8221;&nbsp; See
checklist items (APP2090.1: CAT II) and (APP2090.2: CAT II).&nbsp;
<b>This is the big change.</b></li>
</ol>

<p>Two related points:
<ol>
<li>
Sadly, the AppDev STIG latest revision has a
formatting glitch; all second-level headings aren&rsquo;t numbered
in the body, with the result that the table-of-contents numbers
don&rsquo;t match the body.&nbsp; Still, it has the updated
technical content, and future versions will presumably fix the
formatting.</li>
<li>The wording of DoDI 8500.2&rsquo;s DCPD-1 has
been confusing people for years (I hear that at least parts of NASA
have also used this text,
inheriting the same confusion).&nbsp; In the short term, the DoD
CIO&rsquo;s formal clarification should help.&nbsp; In the longer
term, there is an effort to switch the DoD to a single set of
federal information assurance controls defined in NIST Special
Publication 800-53.&nbsp; Its equivalent control, SA-6(1), has much
clearer text.</li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>But the editorial gaff in the AppDev STIG, and
the work on improving the wording of controls long term, shouldn&#8217;t detract
from the main point.</p>
<p>The main point is:</p>
<p><b><i>Open Source
Software (OSS) is now much easier to use in the DoD</i></b>.</p>
