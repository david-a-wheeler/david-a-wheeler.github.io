There are a large number of Free-Libre / Open Source Software (FLOSS)
licenses, but only a few are widely used.
Unsurprisingly, the widely-used licenses tend to be compatible &#8212;
that is, it’s possible to combine software under the different licenses
to produce a larger work. But many people have trouble figuring out
when they can be combined, or how.
</p>
<p>
So I&#8217;ve created a little figure which I call the “FLOSS license slide” to
make it easier to see if FLOSS licenses can be combined in many common
cases, and if so, what the basic ramifications are.
I&#8217;ve crafted it so that the figure and explanatory text all fit in a page,
which can be handy.
</p>
<p>
You can look at the FLOSS license slide in one of two formats:
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.dwheeler.com/essays/floss-license-slide.pdf">PDF of &#8220;FLOSS License Slide&#8221;</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.dwheeler.com/essays/floss-license-slide.odt">OpenDocument version of &#8220;FLOSS License Slide&#8221;</a></li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
This is currently a draft, because I&#8217;d like to hear comments before
&#8220;finishing&#8221; this.  Also, it&#8217;s based on the &#8220;final draft&#8221; of GPLv3; things
could change before that revision is complete (though I doubt it).
There&#8217;s no end in trying to add other licenses, but
if there&#8217;s a big mistake in this document, I&#8217;d like to know.
I&#8217;m not a lawyer, and if you need formal legal advice you need to consult your
own attorney. But for many people, this is the information you needed,
so here it is.
