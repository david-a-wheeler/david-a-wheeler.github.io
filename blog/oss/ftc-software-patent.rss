The
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ftc.gov/opa/2008/11/ipmarketplace.shtm&quot;&gt;U.S.
Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has announced the first of a possible series
of public hearings to &amp;#8220;explore the evolving market for intellectual
property (IP)&amp;#8221;&lt;/a&gt;. They&amp;#8217;ll begin December 5, 2008, in Washington, DC.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Please let the FTC know that the U.S. should
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dwheeler.com/essays/software-patents.html&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;eliminate software patents!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
The U.S. courts made the mistake of rewriting the laws to permit
software patents and business method patents, resulting in a
stifling of both competition and innovation.
Certainly, software patents have been harming
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dwheeler.com/oss_fs_why.html&quot;&gt;free/libre/open-source software (FLOSS)&lt;/a&gt;, but they&amp;#8217;ve
been harmful to proprietary software development too.
The
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ftc.gov/bc/workshops/ipmarketplace/&quot;&gt;
U.S. government is asking for comments&lt;/a&gt; - so please let them know about
the problems software patents cause, so that we can get rid of them!
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
To help, I&amp;#8217;ve posted a web page titled
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dwheeler.com/essays/software-patents.html&quot;&gt;Eliminate Software Patents!&lt;/a&gt;.
This page points to many existing
papers and organizations that explain &lt;i&gt;why&lt;/i&gt; software patents should
be eliminated.
And it also lists some ways that, if they can&amp;#8217;t
eliminate the mistake, to at least reduce the damage of the mistake.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I think such comments would be very much in line with their series.
They state that
&amp;#8220;The patent system has experienced significant change since the
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ftc.gov/os/2003/10/innovationrpt.pdf&quot;&gt;FTC
released its first IP Report in October 2003&lt;/a&gt;,
and more changes are under consideration&amp;#8230;
[changes include] decisions
on injunctive relief, patentability, and licensing issues&amp;#8230; [and]
there is new learning regarding the operation of the patent
system and its contribution to innovation and competition.&amp;#8221;
Even the FTC&amp;#8217;s original 2003 report noted how many people were opposed
to software patents.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Please contact the FTC, and let them know that software patents should
be eliminated&amp;#8230;
and feel free to use any of these resources if you do contact them.
&lt;/p&gt;
