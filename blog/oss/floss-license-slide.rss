There are a large number of Free-Libre / Open Source Software (FLOSS)
licenses, but only a few are widely used.
Unsurprisingly, the widely-used licenses tend to be compatible &amp;#8212;
that is, it’s possible to combine software under the different licenses
to produce a larger work. But many people have trouble figuring out
when they can be combined, or how.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So I&amp;#8217;ve created a little figure which I call the “FLOSS license slide” to
make it easier to see if FLOSS licenses can be combined in many common
cases, and if so, what the basic ramifications are.
I&amp;#8217;ve crafted it so that the figure and explanatory text all fit in a page,
which can be handy.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
You can look at the FLOSS license slide in one of two formats:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dwheeler.com/essays/floss-license-slide.pdf&quot;&gt;PDF of &amp;#8220;FLOSS License Slide&amp;#8221;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dwheeler.com/essays/floss-license-slide.odt&quot;&gt;OpenDocument version of &amp;#8220;FLOSS License Slide&amp;#8221;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This is currently a draft, because I&amp;#8217;d like to hear comments before
&amp;#8220;finishing&amp;#8221; this.  Also, it&amp;#8217;s based on the &amp;#8220;final draft&amp;#8221; of GPLv3; things
could change before that revision is complete (though I doubt it).
There&amp;#8217;s no end in trying to add other licenses, but
if there&amp;#8217;s a big mistake in this document, I&amp;#8217;d like to know.
I&amp;#8217;m not a lawyer, and if you need formal legal advice you need to consult your
own attorney. But for many people, this is the information you needed,
so here it is.
&lt;/p&gt;
