Earlier this month I gave a presentation about
open source software (aka OSS, Free Software, or FLOSS)
at a conference near Washington, DC.
You can now download the
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dwheeler.com/essays/oss_200703.pdf&quot;&gt;March 2007
presentation &amp;#8220;Open Source Software&amp;#8221; in PDF format&lt;/a&gt;; you can also get it in
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dwheeler.com/essays/oss_200703.odp&quot;&gt;OpenDocument
format&lt;/a&gt;.
For the OpenDocument version, make sure you
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dwheeler.com/#corefonts&quot;&gt;have the fonts you need&lt;/a&gt;.
Those are just the slides; I&amp;#8217;ve separately made the
audio available in several formats:
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dwheeler.com/multimedia/oss_200703.ogg&quot;&gt;[OGG (Vorbis)]&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dwheeler.com/multimedia/oss_200703.mp3&quot;&gt;[MP3]&lt;/a&gt;, and
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dwheeler.com/multimedia/oss_200703.flac&quot;&gt;[FLAC]&lt;/a&gt;.
You should be able to understand the presentation just from the audio,
but looking at the slides while listening to the audio is even better.
For the audio,
I recommend using the Ogg Vorbis format - it&amp;#8217;s the smallest file, and it
has very good quality.
The FLAC format is lossless, and is useful for recoding later
(it&amp;#8217;s much smaller than WAV or AIFF while still not losing anything).
The MP3 format is useful if your player can&amp;#8217;t handle Ogg Vorbis yet
(complain to your manufacturer!) - while MP3 is an ISO standard, MP3 isn&amp;#8217;t
an open standard because it&amp;#8217;s patent-encumbered.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The conference was titled
&amp;#8220;Open Source - Open Standards - Open Architecture&amp;#8221;, and was put on
by the non-profit
&lt;a href=&quot;http://afei.org&quot;&gt;Association for Enterprise Integration (AFEI)&lt;/a&gt;
(a member of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://ndia.org&quot;&gt;NDIA&lt;/a&gt; family of associations).
A lot of people were particularly surprised to learn that
essentially all open source software (FLOSS) are commercial
off-the-shelf (COTS) software, a point I make in more detail in
my essay
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dwheeler.com/essays/commercial-floss.html&quot;&gt;&amp;#8216;Commercial&amp;#8217; is not the opposite of Free-Libre / Open Source Software (FLOSS)&lt;/a&gt;.
Basically, the U.S. government&amp;#8217;s own laws (particularly Title 10 section 101) and regulations (particularly the Federal Acquisition Regulation)
make it clear that nearly all open source software is
commercial off-the-shelf (COTS).
There are two kinds of COTS software products: proprietary software and
open source software.
&lt;/p&gt;
