<p>
If you&#8217;re interested in understanding the
legal, contract, or government
acquisition issues in applying free / libre / open source software (FLOSS),
come to the
<a href="http://opensourcecommunitysummit.org">
&#8220;Open Source License Clinic&#8221; on May 9, 2013, 9am-noon (EDT), in
Washington, DC</a>.
This clinic will be hosted by the non-profit
Open Source Initiative (OSI), and is

their proficiency to better serve their organizations objectives as well

licenses and issues in straight-forward terms make the clinic of value
to anyone involved in the lifecycle of a technology decision/acquisition
or strategy for internal software development.&#8221;
