I&amp;#8217;ve just revised my paper
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dwheeler.com/essays/gpl-compatible.html&quot;&gt;
Make Your Open Source Software GPL-Compatible. Or Else&lt;/a&gt;.
Among other things, the new version notes the interesting
events surrounding Apache and XFree86.
&lt;p&gt;
Apache has changed their license, claiming they&amp;#8217;re now
GPL-compatible; the FSF doesn&amp;#8217;t agree that it&amp;#8217;s compatible.
Regardless of which version the courts will agree on, it&amp;#8217;s
clear that some people who deal with Apache&amp;#8217;s license agree
that GPL compatibility is important.
&lt;p&gt;
The XFree86 situation is even more muddled.
David Dawes of XFree86 plans to change the XFree86 code license
to be GPL-incompatible, and that&amp;#8217;s started a firestorm.
&lt;p&gt;
I continue to use the original title, which only uses the term
&amp;#8220;Open Source Software&amp;#8221; (OSS) instead of &amp;#8220;OSS/FS&amp;#8221;.
The real reason for the original title is that when I submitted
this to OsOpinion, they had strict size limits that I needed to
adhere to.
Although OsOpinion is no more (and only my copy survives), it&amp;#8217;s still
helpful for searchers to keep the same title.
Besides, those who prefer the term &amp;#8220;Free Software&amp;#8221; don&amp;#8217;t really need
this explanation; people who use the term &amp;#8220;Free Software&amp;#8221; and intentionally
use GPL-incompatible licenses are rare indeed, and almost always
consider the ramifications of their decisions.
This essay is aimed at those who have &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; fully considered the
ramifications of choosing a GPL-incompatible license.
