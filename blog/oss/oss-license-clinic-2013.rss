If you&amp;#8217;re interested in understanding the
legal, contract, or government
acquisition issues in applying free / libre / open source software (FLOSS),
come to the
&lt;a href=&quot;http://opensourcecommunitysummit.org&quot;&gt;
&amp;#8220;Open Source License Clinic&amp;#8221; on May 9, 2013, 9am-noon (EDT), in
Washington, DC&lt;/a&gt;.
This clinic will be hosted by the non-profit
Open Source Initiative (OSI), and is
&amp;#8220;designed as a cross-industry, cross-community workshop
for legal, contract, acquisition and program professionals who wish to
deepen their understanding of open source software licenses, and raise
their proficiency to better serve their organizations objectives as well
as identify problems which may be unique to government. Discussion of
licenses and issues in straight-forward terms make the clinic of value
to anyone involved in the lifecycle of a technology decision/acquisition
or strategy for internal software development.&amp;#8221;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I&amp;#8217;m one of the speakers, along with:

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ms. Vicki Allums, General Counsel, Defense Information Systems Agency, Department of Defense&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Mr. Mike Milinkovich, OSI board director and Executive Director, Eclipse Foundation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mr. Luis Villa, OSI board director and Deputy General Counsel, WIkimedia Foundation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
