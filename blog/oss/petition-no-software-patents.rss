I encourage all US citizens to sign
&lt;a href=&quot;https://wwws.whitehouse.gov/petition-tool/petition/direct-patent-office-cease-issuing-software-patents/vvNslSTq&quot;&gt;this petition to the US White House
to &amp;#8220;direct the patent office to cease issuing software patents&amp;#8221;&lt;/a&gt;.
I believe
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dwheeler.com/essays/software-patents.html&quot;&gt;software
patents impede innovation (instead of helping it), and they
have become a threat to the US economy&lt;/a&gt;.
Many organizations involved in software
are now spending lots of time fending off patent trolls,
fighting patent lawsuits, or cannot safely solve problems
due to patent thickets.
The recently-passed
&amp;#8220;America Invents Act&amp;#8221; (AIA) completely failed to deal with this
fundamental problem.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Signing a petition won&amp;#8217;t immediately solve anything.
That&amp;#8217;s not how it works.
But repeatedly making the government aware that there&amp;#8217;s a real
problem is a good first step to solving a problem.
In the US,
&lt;a href=&quot;https://wwws.whitehouse.gov/petitions/#!/how-why/introduction&quot;&gt;the
right of the people to petition their government is guaranteed by
the first amendment of the US Constitution&lt;/a&gt;
(&amp;#8220;Congress shall make no law &amp;#8230;. abridging&amp;#8230; the right of the people
peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government
for a redress of grievances&amp;#8221;).&lt;/a&gt;
Everyone is affected today by software, and so far the government
has not effectively dealt with the problem.
Please use this opportunity to make the government aware of a real problem.
&lt;/p&gt;
