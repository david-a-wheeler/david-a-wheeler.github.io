<p>
In response to a posting by Jeff V. Merkey,
Ingo Molnar used my tool
<a href="http://www.dwheeler.com/sloccount">SLOCCount</a> to
estimate the effort it would take to redevelop Linux kernel version 2.6.
Molnar&#8217;s rough estimate found it would cost $176M (US) to
redevelop the Linux kernel using traditional proprietary approaches.
I thought it was an interesting way to respond, but I knew that the
defaults in SLOCCount are probably not the best for the Linux kernel itself.
After all, an operating system kernel is much more complicated and difficult
to implement than most programs, and although there are ways to account for
that, SLOCCount by default doesn&#8217;t do so.
By using a more detailed cost model and much more information about the
Linux kernel, I created another effort estimate that refines Molnar&#8217;s work.
Bottom line: I believe the current Linux kernel 2.6 would take
closer to $612M (US) to redevelop.
