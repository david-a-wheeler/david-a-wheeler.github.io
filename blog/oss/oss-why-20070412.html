<p><a name="oss-why-20070412"><font size="+2"><b>April 2007 release of &#8220;Why OSS/FS? Look at the Numbers!&#8221;</b></font></a></p><p></p>
<p>
Finally, I&#8217;ve released a new version of
<a href="http://www.dwheeler.com/oss_fs_why.html">&#8220;Why Open Source Software /
Free Software (OSS/FS, FLOSS, FOSS)? Look at the Numbers!&#8221;</a>
This paper continues to provide
&#8220;quantitative data that, in many cases, using open source
software / free software (abbreviated as OSS/FS, FLOSS, or FOSS) is a
reasonable or even superior approach to using their proprietary competition
according to various measures. This paperâ€™s goal is to show that you should
consider using OSS/FS when acquiring software.&#8221;

whose source text is made public (open-source software), as this is the only
way of guaranteeing that no backdoors are built into programmes [and calls] on
the Commission to lay down a standard for the level of security of e-mail
software packages, placing those packages whose source code has not been made
public in the &#8216;least reliable&#8217; category&#8221; (5 September, 2001; 367 votes

Referenced &#8220;Trusting Trust&#8221; attack</a>.
Here&#8217;s the text:
	&#8220;An Air Force evaluation by Karger and Schell first publicly described
	this very nasty computer attack, which Ken Thompson ably demonstrated
	and described in his classic 1984 paper &#8220;Reflections on Trusting
	Trust&#8221;. Thompson showed that because we use software to create other
	software, if an attacker subverts the software-creating programs, no
	amount of auditing any program can help you - the subverted programs
	can hide whatever they want to! This has been called the
	&#8220;uncounterable attack&#8221;, and some have said that it&#8217;s impossible to
	secure computers simply because this attack is possible. Some have
	even said that all those security audits of OSS/FS are worthless,
	because subverted tools could insert attacks the auditors couldn&#8217;t
	see. But it turns out that the trusting trust attack can be countered.
	My 2005 paper Countering Trusting Trust through Diverse
	Double-Compiling (DDC), published by ACSAC, shows how the
	&#8220;uncounterable&#8221; trusting trust attack can be countered. But there&#8217;s a
	catch: the DDC defense only works if you can get the source code for
	your software creation tools, including the operating system,
	compiler, and so on. That kind of information is typically only
	available for OSS/FS programs! Thus, even in the case of the dangerous
	&#8220;trusting trust&#8221; attack, OSS/FS has a security advantage.&#8221;

<p>
As I mentioned earlier,
I wish I&#8217;d used the term &#8220;FLOSS&#8221;
(Free-Libre / Open Source Software) as my all-encompassing term in this paper.
FLOSS is much easier to say than some of the alternatives, and
the term &#8220;Free Software&#8221; is widely misunderstood as being &#8220;no cost&#8221;.
However, I&#8217;ve used the term OSS/FS all over in the paper,
and it&#8217;s awkward to change now
(and people might not find the document they were looking for), so
I haven&#8217;t changed it here.
</p>
<p>
Enjoy!
