&lt;a href=&quot;http://software.newsforge.com/software/04/04/02/179211.shtml?tid=132&amp;amp;tid=150&amp;amp;tid=82&quot;&gt;
NewsForge has just posted an interview of me, where I discuss
the Microsoft-funded studies claiming that Microsoft&amp;#8217;s proprietary products
have a lower total cost of ownership (TCO) than
Open Source Software/Free Software (OSS/FS)&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;p&gt;
My answers shouldn&amp;#8217;t be surprising to those who&amp;#8217;ve read
my other writings.  For example, I say that:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&amp;#8220;TCO is extremely sensitive to a specific circumstance, so
a TCO for one situation doesn&amp;#8217;t usually apply to other cases.
I&amp;#8217;m sure that there are cases where Microsoft&amp;#8217;s approach has
a lower TCO than alternatives, so in those specific cases it&amp;#8217;s true.
However, there are also cases where open source software or
Linux-based solutions have a lower TCO.
You really have to consider all the costs for your specific situation,
and your results may differ.&amp;#8221;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I don&amp;#8217;t have a lot of faith in Microsoft&amp;#8217;s studies,
because Microsoft funded almost all of them&amp;#8230; a concern I
discuss in the interview.
As I say,
&amp;#8220;There may be useful information in the self-funded studies,
but I don&amp;#8217;t have any way to be confident with them.&amp;#8221;
There are just too many ways for a vendor to tweak studies they fund.
Oh, and I&amp;#8217;d say the same thing about a study funded by Red Hat or IBM or
Apple or anyone else.
You should give much more weight to &lt;i&gt;independent&lt;/i&gt; studies.
&lt;p&gt;
