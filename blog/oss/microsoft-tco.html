<a href="http://software.newsforge.com/software/04/04/02/179211.shtml?tid=132&amp;tid=150&amp;tid=82">
NewsForge has just posted an interview of me, where I discuss
the Microsoft-funded studies claiming that Microsoft&#8217;s proprietary products
have a lower total cost of ownership (TCO) than
Open Source Software/Free Software (OSS/FS)</a>.
<p>
My answers shouldn&#8217;t be surprising to those who&#8217;ve read
my other writings.  For example, I say that:
<blockquote>
&#8220;TCO is extremely sensitive to a specific circumstance, so
a TCO for one situation doesn&#8217;t usually apply to other cases.
I&#8217;m sure that there are cases where Microsoft&#8217;s approach has
a lower TCO than alternatives, so in those specific cases it&#8217;s true.
However, there are also cases where open source software or
Linux-based solutions have a lower TCO.
You really have to consider all the costs for your specific situation,
and your results may differ.&#8221;
</blockquote>
<p>
I don&#8217;t have a lot of faith in Microsoft&#8217;s studies,
because Microsoft funded almost all of them&#8230; a concern I
discuss in the interview.
As I say,
&#8220;There may be useful information in the self-funded studies,
but I don&#8217;t have any way to be confident with them.&#8221;
There are just too many ways for a vendor to tweak studies they fund.
Oh, and I&#8217;d say the same thing about a study funded by Red Hat or IBM or
Apple or anyone else.
You should give much more weight to <i>independent</i> studies.
