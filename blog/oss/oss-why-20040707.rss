I&amp;#8217;ve made a new release of my paper &amp;#8220;Why Open Source Software /
Free Software (OSS/FS)? Look at the Numbers!&amp;#8221;
It&amp;#8217;s a tome, and getting even longer, as more stuff becomes
available.
This is basically a minor release, with various small additions
and improvements here and there.
Here are some highlights:
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
I&amp;#8217;ve added references to the interesting paper
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sims.berkeley.edu/~hal/Papers/2004/linux-adoption-in-the-public-sector.pdf&quot;&gt;
Linux Adoption in the Public Sector: An Economic Analysis&lt;/a&gt;
by Hal R. Varian and Carl Shapiro (University of California, Berkeley;
1 December 2003).
&lt;li&gt;
I&amp;#8217;ve also added lots of information on the
major Microsoft Internet Explorer vulnerability that&amp;#8217;s been
undergoing a lot of press.
IE has been undergoing some really nasty exploitation as of
mid June 2004, and Microsoft only released a &amp;#8220;fix&amp;#8221; on July 2, 2004;
but Microsoft had NINE MONTHS to fix it, and didn&amp;#8217;t.
OSS customers can patch their systems, but a proprietary
customer doesn&amp;#8217;t have that option. A proprietary vendor that
ignores such a nasty vulnerability for that long is performing a
nearly criminal act; they&amp;#8217;re at least aiding criminals.
That&amp;#8217;s especially crazy because Microsoft has said they&amp;#8217;ve been
working hard on security since 2002; I think that&amp;#8217;s probably true,
but this sure is a SCARY lapse.
CERT and SANS recommend switching away from IE
as one of the options for IE users.
&lt;li&gt;
I added a reference to the
&lt;a href=&quot;http://news.com.com/Indian+president+calls+for+open+source+in+defense/2100-7344_3-5259836.html&quot;&gt;
Indian presidential announcement&lt;/a&gt; about OSS/FS.
&lt;li&gt;
Added a link to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cospa-project.org/&quot;&gt;COSPA project&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
Fixed typos, per very helpful comments from Ian McIntosh.
&lt;/ol&gt;
