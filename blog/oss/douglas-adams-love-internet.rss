Douglas Adams wrote
&amp;#8220;How to Stop Worrying and Learn to Love the Internet&amp;#8221;&lt;/a&gt;.
It&amp;#8217;s a wonderful essay that is still a good read today.
In particular, I think it&amp;#8217;s an important article to read
if you&amp;#8217;re still struggling with understanding where the Internet is going,
or if you&amp;#8217;re trying to figure out how to address the trustworthiness 
of group-developed information like
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dwheeler.com/blog/2010/03/21/#wikipedia-research&quot;&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dwheeler.com/oss_fs_why.html&quot;&gt;open source software&lt;/a&gt;,
or the blogosphere.
Adams said:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&amp;#8220;Because the Internet is so new we still don&amp;#8217;t really
understand what it is. We mistake it for a type of publishing or
broadcasting, because that&amp;#8217;s what we&amp;#8217;re used to. So people
complain that there&amp;#8217;s a lot of rubbish online, or that it&amp;#8217;s
dominated by Americans, or that you can&amp;#8217;t necessarily trust what you
read on the web. Imagine trying to apply any of those criticisms to what
you hear on the telephone. Of course you can&amp;#8217;t &amp;#8216;trust&amp;#8217;
what people tell you on the web anymore than you can &amp;#8216;trust&amp;#8217;
what people tell you on megaphones, postcards or in restaurants. Working
out the social politics of who you can trust and why is, quite literally,
what a very large part of our brain has evolved to do. For some batty
reason we turn off this natural scepticism when we see things in any
medium which require a lot of work or resources to work in, or in which
we can&amp;#8217;t easily answer back &amp;mdash; like newspapers, television
or granite. Hence &amp;#8216;carved in stone.&amp;#8217; What should concern us
is not that we can&amp;#8217;t take what we read on the internet on trust &amp;mdash;
of course you can&amp;#8217;t, it&amp;#8217;s just people talking &amp;mdash;
but that we ever got into the &lt;i&gt;dangerous habit of believing
what we read in the newspapers or saw on the TV [emphasis mine]&lt;/i&gt;  &amp;mdash; a mistake
that no one who has met an actual journalist would ever make&amp;#8230;
Interactivity. Many-to-many communications. Pervasive networking. These
are cumbersome new terms for elements in our lives so fundamental that,
before we lost them, we didn&amp;#8217;t even know to have names for them.&amp;#8221;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
