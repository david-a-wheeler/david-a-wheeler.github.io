<p>
You need a community, not just some dump of posted code,
if you want good open source software.
I can demonstrate this through my
trivial hunt for &#8220;random quote&#8221; code&#8230; so let me tell you my story.
</p>

<p>
I recently decided that I&#8217;d like the front page of my website to
show a randomly-selected quote.
For security reasons, I avoid using dynamically-run code on my own site,
so I needed to use Javascript (ECMAscript) to do this.
Easy enough, I thought&#8230; I&#8217;ll just use Google to find a program that did this,
and I searched on &#8220;random quotation Javascript&#8221;.
</p>

<p>
But what I found was that a lot of people don&#8217;t seem to care about
long-term maintenance, <i>or</i> correctness.
<a href="http://www.codelifter.com/main/javascript/randomquote.shtml">
Codelifter&#8217;s sample code by etLux</a> does the job, but also shows the
problem.  The code has a lot of statements like this:
<pre>
 Quotation[0] = "Time is of the essence! Comb your hair.";
 Quotation[1] = "Sanity is a golden apple with no shoelaces.";
 ...
</pre>
Does this work? Sure, but it&#8217;s <i>terrible</i> for maintenance.
Now you have to write extra code, unnecessarily maintain index numbers,
and if you want to delete a quote in the middle, you have to renumber things.
Even for tiny tasks like this, maintenance matters over time.
I&#8217;m going to use this for my personal website, which I plan to have
for decades; life is too short to fight hard-to-maintain code over a long time.
</p>
<p>
Even worse, this and many other examples did a lousy job of
picking a random quote.
Many sample programs picked the random quote using this kind of code
(where Q is the number of quotes):
<pre>
 var whichQuotation=Math.round(Math.random()*(Q-1));
</pre>
This actually doesn&#8217;t choose the values with equal probability.
To see why, walk through the logic if there are only 3 quotes.
Math.random returns a value between 0 and 1 (not including 1); if there
are 3 quotes, Math.random()*(Q-1) produces a floating point
value between 0 and 2 (not including 2).
Rounding a value between 0 and 0.5 (not including 0.5) produces 0, between 0.5
and 1.5 (not including 1.5) produces 1, and between 1.5 and 2 produces 2&#8230;.
which means that the middle quote is <i>far</i> more likely to be selected
(it will be selected 50% of the time, instead of the correct 33%).
The &#8220;round&#8221; operation is the wrong operator in this case!
</p>
<p>
I&#8217;m not really interested in picking on the author of this
code sample; LOTS of different sample codes do exactly the wrong thing.
</p>
<p>
The problem seems to be that once some code snippet gets posted,
in many places there&#8217;s no mechanism to discuss the code or to propose
an improvement.
In other words, there&#8217;s no community.
I noticed these problems immediately in several samples I saw, yet
there was no obvious way for me to do anything about it.
</p>
<p>
In the end, I ended up writing my own code. For your amusement,
here it is.
Perhaps there needs to be a &#8220;trivial SourceForge&#8221; for taking tiny
fragments like this and allowing community improvement.
</p>

<p>
First, I put this in the head section of my HTML:
</p>

<pre>
&lt;script language="JavaScript">
 // Code by David A. Wheeler; this trivial ECMAscript is public domain:
  var quotations = new Array(
    "Quote1",
    "Quote2",
    "Quote3"
  );
 var my_pick = Math.floor(quotations.length*Math.random());
 var random_quote = "Your random quote: &lt;i>" + quotations[my_pick] + "&lt;/i>";
&lt;/script>
</pre>

<p>
I then put this in the body section of my HTML:
</p>

<pre>
&lt;script language="JavaScript">
 document.write(random_quote)
&lt;/script>
</pre>

<p>
I intentionally didn&#8217;t include some defensive measures against bad
software libraries.
Unfortunately, many software libraries are terrible, and that certainly
includes many random number generators.
For example, Math.random() isn&#8217;t supposed to return 1, only values less
than that&#8230; but returning an (incorrect) 1 isn&#8217;t an unknown defect,
and that would cause an out-of-bounds error.
Also, many implementations of random() are notoriously bad; they
often have trivially tiny cycles, or fail even trivial randomness tests.
I would put defensive measures in software designed to be highly
reliable or secure (for example, I might re-implement the random function
to be sure I got a reasonable one).
But in this case, I thought it&#8217;d be better to just rely on the libraries&#8230;
if the results are terrible, then users might complain to the library
implementors.  And if the library implementors fix their implementations,
it helps <i>everyone</i>.
</p>

<p>
I donate the above snippet to the public domain. It&#8217;s not clear
at all that it can be copyrighted, actually; it&#8217;s far too trivial.
But it&#8217;s still useful to have such snippets, and I hope that someone will
organize a community for sharing and maintaining trivial snippets like this.
