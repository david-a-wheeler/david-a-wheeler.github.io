If you&amp;#8217;re involved in a free / libre / open source software (FLOSS) project,
go to
&lt;a href=&quot;https://bestpractices.coreinfrastructure.org/&quot;&gt;bestpractices.coreinfrastructure.org&lt;/a&gt;
and get your best practices badge!
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The Linux Foundation&amp;#8217;s Core Infrastructure Initiative (CII)
has just announced its CII best practices badging program
for FLOSS projects.
It&amp;#8217;s a free program that lets developers explain how they
follow best practices, and if they do, they can get a badge
that they can show on their GitHub page or anywhere else.
Early badge earners include the Linux kernel, Curl, GitLab,
OpenBlox, OpenSSL, Node.js and Zephyr.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The idea is straightforward.
The Heartbleed vulnerability in OpenSSL made it obvious that
there are widely-accepted best practices that not everyone is doing -
and that even includes important projects.
This isn&amp;#8217;t just speculation;
if you compare
&lt;a href=&quot;https://bestpractices.coreinfrastructure.org/projects/87&quot;&gt;OpenSSL
before Heartbleed&lt;/a&gt; with
&lt;a href=&quot;https://bestpractices.coreinfrastructure.org/projects/54&quot;&gt;current
OpenSSL&lt;/a&gt; the difference is striking.
I think it&amp;#8217;s clear that if
more projects would apply generally-accepted best practices,
we&amp;#8217;d have more secure software.
This badging process helps projects identify those best practices,
determine if they meet them, and show everyone else that they&amp;#8217;re
meeting them.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/linuxfoundation/cii-best-practices-badge&quot;&gt;The
web application and criteria are being maintained
as an open source software project&lt;/a&gt;, so we&amp;#8217;d love to have you!
I say &amp;#8220;we&amp;#8221; because I&amp;#8217;m leading this project&amp;#8230; but it&amp;#8217;s not just me,
and we would love to have you involved.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
More detail is in the
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.linuxfoundation.org/news-media/announcements/2016/05/free-badge-program-signals-what-open-source-projects-meet-criteria&quot;&gt;Linux Foundation
