<p>
In my post
<a href="http://www.dwheeler.com/blog/2008/10/22/#development-cost-linux-2008">
Estimating the Total Development Cost of a Linux Distribution</a>,
I noted that one of Fedora 9&#8217;s largest components was
Enterprise Security Client (ESC), and wondered why
ESC would be so big.
After all, a security client should be small - not large.
</p>
<p>
I just got the answer from Rahul Sundaram of the Fedora project,
who asked internally.
It turns out that ESC currently includes its own copy of
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/XULRunner">XULRunner</a>.
XULRunner essentially provides a library and infrastructure for running
&#8220;XUL+XPCOM&#8221; applications such as Firefox, Thunderbird, and ESC.
You can
<a href="http://www.redhat.com/docs/manuals/cert-system/7.3/html/Enterprise_Security_Client_Guide/Enterprise_Security_Client_Configuration-Enterprise_Security_Client_File_Locations.html">confirm this using the on-line ESC documentation</a>.
This is clearly not optimal; as I noted in a previous blog entry,
<a href="http://www.dwheeler.com/blog/2008/09/19/#use-system-libraries">
developers should use system libraries, and not create their own local
copies</a>.
Rahul says that the
&#8220;the developers are currently working on making it use the system
copy[,] which should drop down the size considerably&#8221;.
</p>
<p>
So ESC isn&#8217;t really that big - it&#8217;s just that ESC creates its own
local copy of a massive infrastructure.
This is obviously not great for security,
since there&#8217;s a higher risk that bugs fixed in the real XULRunner
would not be fixed in ESC&#8217;s local copy.
But this appears to be a temporary issue; once Fedora&#8217;s version of
ESC switches to the system XULRunner, the problem will disappear.
</p>
<p>
By the way, if you&#8217;re interested in the whole &#8220;measuring Linux&#8217;s size&#8221; thing,
you should definitely take a look at the past measurements of Debian.

It&#8217;s neat stuff!
