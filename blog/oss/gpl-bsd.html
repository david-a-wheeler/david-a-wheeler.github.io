<p>
Charles M. Hannum (one of the 4 originators of NetBSD)
has posted a sad article about
serious problems in the NetBSD project, saying
&#8220;the NetBSD Project has stagnated to the point of irrelevance.&#8221;
You can see the
<a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.os.netbsd.general/17246">article</a>
or an
<a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/197748/">LWN article about it</a>.
</p>

<p>
There are still active FreeBSD and OpenBSD communities, and there&#8217;s
much positive to say about FreeBSD and OpenBSD.
I use them occasionally, and
I always welcome a chance to talk to their developers - they&#8217;re sharp folks.
Perhaps NetBSD will partly revive.
But systems based on the Linux kernel (&#8220;Linux&#8221;)
absolutely stomp the *BSDs (FreeBSD, OpenBSD, and NetBSD) in market share.
And Linux-based systems will continue to stomp on the *BSDs
into the foreseeable future.
</p>

<p>
I think there is one primary reason Linux-based systems
completely dominate the *BSDs&#8217; market share - Linux uses the protective
GPL license, and the *BSDs use the permissive (&#8220;BSD-style&#8221;) licenses.
The BSD license has been a lot of trouble for all the *BSDs, even though
they keep protesting that it&#8217;s good for them.
But look what happens.
Every few years, for many years, someone has said,
&#8220;Let&#8217;s start a company based on this BSD code!&#8221;
BSD/OS in particular comes to mind, but Sun (SunOS)
and others have done the same.
They pull the *BSD code in, and some of the best BSD developers,
and write a proprietary derivative. But as a proprietary vendor, their
fork becomes expensive to self-maintain, and eventually the company founders
or loses interest in that codebase
(BSD/OS is gone; Sun switched to Solaris).
All that company work is then lost forever, and good developers
were sucked away during that period. Repeat, repeat, repeat.
That&#8217;s enough by itself to explain why the BSDs
don&#8217;t maintain the pace of Linux kernel development.
But wait - it gets worse.
</p>

<p>
In contrast, the GPL has enforced a consortia-like arrangement
on any major commercial companies that want to use it.
Red Hat, Novell, IBM, and many others are all contributing as a result, and
they feel safe in doing so because the others are legally required
to do the same.
Just look at the domain names on the Linux kernel mailing list - big companies,
actively paying for people to contribute.
<a href="http://gcn.com/vol1_no1/daily-updates/26641-1.html">
In July 2004, Andrew Morton addressed a forum held by U.S. Senators,</a>
and reported that most Linux kernel code was generated by
corporate programmers (37,000 of the last 38,000 changes were
contributed by those paid by companies to do so;
see <a href="http://www.dwheeler.com/oss_fs_why.html#starving_programmers">
my report on OSS/FS numbers</a> for more information).
BSD license advocates claim that the BSD is more &#8220;business friendly&#8221;, but
if you look at actual practice, that argument doesn&#8217;t wash.
The GPL has created a &#8220;safe&#8221; zone of cooperation among companies,
without anyone
having to sign complicated legal documents. A company can&#8217;t feel safe
contributing code to the BSDs, because its competitors might simply copy
the code without reciprocating. There&#8217;s much more corporate cooperation in the
GPL&#8217;ed kernel code than with the BSD&#8217;d kernel code. Which means that in
practice, it&#8217;s actually been the GPL that&#8217;s most &#8220;business-friendly&#8221;.
</p>

<p>
So while the BSDs have lost energy every time a company gets involved,
the GPL&#8217;ed programs gain every time a company gets involved.
And that explains it all.
</p>

<p>
That&#8217;s not the only issue, of course. Linus Torvalds makes mistakes,
but in general he&#8217;s a good leader; leadership
issues are clearly an issue for some of the BSDs.
And Linux&#8217;s ability early on
to support dual-boot computers turned out to be critical years ago. Some people
worried about the legal threats that the BSDs were under early on,
though I don&#8217;t think it had that strong an effect.
But the early Linux kernel had a number of problems
(nonstandard threads, its early network stack was terrible, etc.), which
makes it harder to argue that it was &#8220;better&#8221; at first. And the
Linux kernel came AFTER the *BSDs - the BSDs had a head start,
and a lot of really smart people.
Yet the Linux kernel, and operating systems based on it,
jumped quickly past all of them. I believe that&#8217;s in large
part because Linux didn&#8217;t suffer the endless draining of people and effort
caused by the BSD license.
</p>

<p>
Clearly, some really excellent projects can work well on BSD-style
licenses; witness Apache, for example. It would be a mistake to think
that BSD licenses are &#8220;bad&#8221; licenses, or that the GPL is always the
&#8220;best&#8221; license. But others, like Linux, gcc, etc., have done better
with copylefting / &#8220;protective&#8221; licenses. And some projects, like Wine,
have switched to a protective (copylefting)
license to stem the tide of loss from the project.
Again, it&#8217;s not as simple as &#8220;BSD license bad&#8221; - I don&#8217;t think
we fully understand exactly when each license&#8217;s effects truly have the
most effect. But clearly the license matters; this as close to an experiment
in competing licenses as you&#8217;re likely to get.
</p>

<p>
Obviously, a license choice should depend on your goals. But let&#8217;s look
more carefully at that statement, maybe we can see what type of
license tends to be better for different purposes.
</p>

<p>
If your goal is to get an idea or approach widely used to the largest
possible extent, a permissive license like the BSD (or MIT) license has
much to offer. Anyone can quickly snap up the code and use it. Much of
the TCP/IP code (at least for tools) in Windows was originally from BSD,
I believe; there are even some copyright statements still in it. BSD
code <i>is</i> widely used, and even when it isn&#8217;t used (the Linux
kernel developers wrote their own TCP/IP code) it is certainly studied.
But don&#8217;t expect the public BSD-licensed code to be maintained by
those with a commercial interest in it.
I haven&#8217;t noticed a large number of Microsoft developers
being paid to improve any of the *BSDs, even though they share the same
code ancestries in some cases.
</p>

<p>
If your goal is to have a useful program that stays useful long-term,
then a protective (&#8220;copylefting&#8221;)
license like the LGPL or GPL licenses has much to offer.
Protective licenses force the cooperation that is good for everyone in the long
term, if a long-term useful project is the goal. For example, I&#8217;ve noticed
that GPL projects are far less likely to fork than BSD-licensed projects;
the GPL completely eliminates any financial advantage to forking.
The power of the GPL license
is so strong that even if you choose to not use a copylefting license,
<a href="http://www.dwheeler.com/essays/gpl-compatible.html">
it is critically important that an open source software project use
a GPL-compatible license</a>.
</p>

<p>
Yes, companies could voluntarily cooperate without a license forcing them to.
The *BSDs try to depend on this. But it today&#8217;s cutthroat market,
that&#8217;s more like the &#8220;Prisoner&#8217;s Dilemma&#8221;. In the dilemma, it&#8217;s better
to cooperate; but since the other guy might choose to not cooperate, and
exploit your naivete, you may choose to not cooperate.
A way out of this dilemma is to create a situation where you <i>must</i>
cooperate, and the GPL does that.
</p>

<p>
Again, I don&#8217;t think license selection is all that simple when developing
a free-libre/open source software (FLOSS) program. Obviously the Apache
web server does well with its BSD-ish license. But packages like Linux,
gcc, Samba, and so on all show that the GPL does work.
And more interestingly, they show that a lot of
competing companies can cooperate, when the license requires them to.
