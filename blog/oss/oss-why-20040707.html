I&#8217;ve made a new release of my paper &#8220;Why Open Source Software /
Free Software (OSS/FS)? Look at the Numbers!&#8221;
It&#8217;s a tome, and getting even longer, as more stuff becomes
available.
This is basically a minor release, with various small additions
and improvements here and there.
Here are some highlights:
<ol>
<li>
I&#8217;ve added references to the interesting paper
<a href="http://www.sims.berkeley.edu/~hal/Papers/2004/linux-adoption-in-the-public-sector.pdf">
Linux Adoption in the Public Sector: An Economic Analysis</a>
by Hal R. Varian and Carl Shapiro (University of California, Berkeley;
1 December 2003).
<li>
I&#8217;ve also added lots of information on the
major Microsoft Internet Explorer vulnerability that&#8217;s been
undergoing a lot of press.
IE has been undergoing some really nasty exploitation as of
mid June 2004, and Microsoft only released a &#8220;fix&#8221; on July 2, 2004;
but Microsoft had NINE MONTHS to fix it, and didn&#8217;t.
OSS customers can patch their systems, but a proprietary
customer doesn&#8217;t have that option. A proprietary vendor that
ignores such a nasty vulnerability for that long is performing a
nearly criminal act; they&#8217;re at least aiding criminals.
That&#8217;s especially crazy because Microsoft has said they&#8217;ve been
working hard on security since 2002; I think that&#8217;s probably true,
but this sure is a SCARY lapse.
CERT and SANS recommend switching away from IE
as one of the options for IE users.

I added a reference to the
<a href="http://news.com.com/Indian+president+calls+for+open+source+in+defense/2100-7344_3-5259836.html">
Indian presidential announcement</a> about OSS/FS.
<li>
Added a link to the <a href="http://www.cospa-project.org/">COSPA project</a>
<li>
Fixed typos, per very helpful comments from Ian McIntosh.
