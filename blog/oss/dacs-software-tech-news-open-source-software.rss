The
&lt;a href=&quot;https://softwaretechnews.thedacs.com/stn_view.php?stn_id=56&quot;&gt;January 2011 issue of the &amp;#8220;DACS Software Tech News&amp;#8221; (Volume 14 Number 1)&lt;/a&gt; is finally available!
The entire issue is dedicated to covering the relationship of the
U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) and open source software (OSS).
If you&amp;#8217;re interested in the DoD and software,
the U.S. government and software,
or open source software, you really need to look at this.
Even if you&amp;#8217;re not a U.S. citizen, you&amp;#8217;re probably influenced by
the decisions of the U.S. government
(it spends a lot of money on software!), and the experiences and lessons it
learns are probably useful in many other places.
You have to register (sorry!), but it&amp;#8217;s well worth it.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I wrote or co-wrote several of the articles, so please let me point out
a couple of interesting points in them.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&amp;#8220;Software is a Renewable Military Resource&amp;#8221; 
notes that it&amp;#8217;s possible for projects inside the government to
use collaborative development approaches, even if the software
isn&amp;#8217;t released to the public;
we call these &amp;#8220;Open Government Off-the-shelf&amp;#8221; (OGOTS)
projects.
Another term used for these projects is
Government Off-the-Shelf (GOSS);
people I respect use the term &amp;#8220;GOSS&amp;#8221;, but
I worry that the GOSS term is confusing (GOSS isn&amp;#8217;t OSS,
because GOSS projects don&amp;#8217;t allow arbitrary use and redistribution).
In the DoD, a related term is &amp;#8220;Open Technology Development&amp;#8221; (OTD),
which describes a community-based development process, be it
OGOTS or OSS with community-based maintenance.
The article has a nice little graphic that I think makes this
pretty clear.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
My article
&amp;#8220;Open Source Software Is Commercial&amp;#8221;
won&amp;#8217;t surprise anyone who&amp;#8217;s seen my already-posted article
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dwheeler.com/essays/commercial-floss.html&quot;&gt;Free-Libre / Open Source Software (FLOSS) is Commercial Software&lt;/a&gt;.
Basically, OSS is commercial software.
Anyone who says nonsense phrases like &amp;#8220;commercial or open source software&amp;#8221;
probably doesn&amp;#8217;t understand open source software,
and is unlikely to make good decisions about software.
This new article focuses more on the formal legal definitions.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
My article
&amp;#8220;Publicly Releasing Open Source Software Developed for the U.S. Government&amp;#8221;
summarizes
&amp;#8220;when the U.S. federal
government or its contractors may publicly release, as
open source software (OSS), software developed with
government funds&amp;#8221;.
If you ever interact with the U.S. federal government or its
contractors in software issues, make sure they get a copy of this article.
It&amp;#8217;s easy to say &amp;#8220;follow the rules&amp;#8221; and &amp;#8220;obey the contract&amp;#8221;
but it&amp;#8217;s often impossible to find out what the rules
and contracts &lt;i&gt;actually say&lt;/i&gt;.
Even many lawyers didn&amp;#8217;t know the information in this article,
and this is the kind of information that many &lt;i&gt;non-lawyers&lt;/i&gt; need to know.
All too often the government and its contractors should be releasing
software as OSS, but don&amp;#8217;t know that they have the right to do so.
It&amp;#8217;s taken me years to pull together this information.
The article gives 5 basic questions that you need to answer.
One of those questions &amp;mdash;
&amp;#8220;Do you have the necessary copyright-related rights?&amp;#8221; &amp;mdash;
has a supporting table that I&amp;#8217;m really happy with.
That table manages to take a lot of complicated legal
mumbo jumbo and turn it into something that can be actually understood.
One point this article brings home is that using the term
&amp;#8220;intellectual property&amp;#8221; is grossly misleading;
in government contracting (and in many other circumstances)
it usually doesn&amp;#8217;t matter who holds the copyright;
what matters is who has what rights.
Anyway, if you need this information, you need this article.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Anyway, here&amp;#8217;s the full list of articles in this issue:

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So please, take a look at
&lt;a href=&quot;https://softwaretechnews.thedacs.com/stn_view.php?stn_id=56&quot;&gt;January 2011 issue of the &amp;#8220;DACS Software Tech News&amp;#8221; (Volume 14 Number 1)&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;p&gt;
Full disclosure: I&amp;#8217;m on the DACS Software Tech News board
(as a volunteer; nobody pays me).
But the issue is good anyway :-).
