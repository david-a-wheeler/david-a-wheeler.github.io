<p>
I just learned of fun web application called
<a href="http://code.google.com/p/parchment/">Parchment</a>.
Parchment lets you play interactive fiction (I.F., aka &#8220;text adventure games&#8221;)
using just your web browser.
It only works with I.F. in &#8220;Z-machine&#8221; format, but that&#8217;s
a very common format.
</p>
<p>
So
<a href="http://parchment.toolness.com/">
go to the parchment site and try out something from their
long list of interactive fiction</a>&#8230; now you don&#8217;t need to install
anything!
That includes
<a href="http://parchment.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/parchment.html?story=http://parchment.toolness.com/if-archive/games/zcode/Accuse.zblorb.js">
my small replayable puzzle &#8220;Accuse&#8221;</a>
(my <a href="http://www.dwheeler.com/accuse/">Accuse source code
is already available</a>).
</p>
<p>
If you want more information about it,
<a href="http://www.toolness.com/wp/?p=49">
here&#8217;s a brief post about Parchment by its author, Atul Varma</a>.
Atul built this based on an existing program,
Thomas Thurman&#8217;s Gnusto.
Both are open source software (using the GPLv2 license).
Once again, this demonstrates the neat thing about community-developed
software; one person developed a program for one circumstance,
and another extended it for a different circumstance.
</p>
<p>
There are several tools available for <i>creating</i> interactive fiction.
I&#8217;ve been watching
<a href="http://inform7.com/">Inform 7</a> for a while, with interest,
because it takes a radically different approach to writing code.
Inform 7 is a natural-language programming language that tries to
actively exploit features of natural language to make developing these
kinds of things easier.
<a href="http://www.brasslantern.org/writers/howto/i7tutorial.html">
You can see a brief Inform 7 tutorial if you&#8217;re curious</a>, as well as
the full <a href="http://www.inform7.com/learn/man/index.html">
Writing with Inform</a> documentation.
Inform 7 isn&#8217;t itself OSS, though significant portions are;
<a href="http://inform7.com/sources/i6n/">inform 6 (a key substrate)</a>
and
<a href="http://inform7.com/sources/webs/">
many other portions including the Inform 7 standard rules</a>
are released under the Artistic License 2.0.
The
<a href="http://inform7.com/write/extensions/">extensions</a>
are released under the &#8220;Attribution Creative Commons licence&#8221;;
that&#8217;s not normally a license used for software, but I think it&#8217;d meet
the criteria for OSS, and
<a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Licensing">Fedora approves of
this license for content</a>.
I hope that someday the rest will be released as OSS as well.
The logic behind Inform 7 is described in
<a href="http://www.inform7.com/learn/documents/WhitePaper.pdf">
&#8220;Natural Language, Semantic Analysis and Interactive Fiction&#8221;
by Graham Nelson</a>.
If you&#8217;re interested in some of the technical stuff behind it,
the text of the
<a href="http://www.inform7.com/sources/src/stdrules/Woven/index.html">
Standard Rules</a>,
the text of the
<a href="http://inform7.com/write/extensions/">extensions</a>,
