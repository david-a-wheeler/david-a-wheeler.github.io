On October 27 I&#8217;ll be speaking at the
<a href="http://www.mdhitech.org/Calendar/html/412.html">
Open Source Enterprise Solutions Conference</a>
in Rockville, Maryland.
This event is put on by the
<a href="http://www.mdhitech.org/">Tech Council of Maryland</a>.
My topic is security and open source software; those who&#8217;ve
<a href="http://www.dwheeler.com/secure-programs">read my books and
articles</a> won&#8217;t be terribly surprised by the content.
I debunk extreme views like &#8220;open source is always more secure&#8221; and
&#8220;open source is never more secure,&#8221; for example.
<p>
One surprising thing is how many open source software / Free Software
(OSS/FS) security-related companies and projects
are based in Maryland.
There are quite a number!
They include:
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.sourcefire.com/">Sourcefire</a>,
lead developer of the
<a href="http://www.sourcefire.com/snort/snortorg.html">
most popular network intrusion detection system (IDS)</a>,
<a href="http://www.snort.org/">Snort</a>.
Snort&#8217;s so popular that many other IDS systems accept its data format.
<li>
<a href="http://www.bastille-linux.org/">Bastille Linux</a>,
an excellent Linux operating system hardening project.
<li>
<a href="http://www.owasp.org/">Open Web Application
Security Project (OWASP)</a>,
<a href="http://www.owasp.org/about/contact.html">headquartered in
Columbia, Maryland</a> and sponsored by folks such as
<a href="http://www.aspectsecurity.com/">Aspect Security</a>.
OWASP publishes a very popular top ten, but they also have tools and
other projects.
<li>
The
<a href="http://ferret.crhc.uiuc.edu/">Ferret Security Auditing Toolset</a>
is a project from the University of Maryland.
<li>
<a href="http://www.nsa.gov/selinux/">
Security-Enhanced Linux (SELinux)</a>, a research project that
added significant new access control capabilities to GNU/Linux
operating systems.
SELinux is now included in several Linux distributions.
<li>
There are many other consulting companies.
I did a quick search of the
<a href="http://openbsdpl.sourceforge.net/www/support.html">
companies providing OpenBSD support</a>, and they included
<a href="http://www.CodefusionIS.com">
Codefusion Internet Services</a> of
Cumberland, Maryland,
who provide Unix-based consulting services to
small businesses and organizations, particularly
with *BSD Unix (OpenBSD, FreeBSD) and Linux systems.
</ul>
My point is that there&#8217;s a <i>lot</i> going on in Maryland
that combines security with open source software, which is very interesting.
