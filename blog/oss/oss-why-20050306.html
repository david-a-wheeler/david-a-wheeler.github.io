<p><a name="oss-why-20050306"><font size="+2"><b>March 2005 release of &#8220;Why OSS/FS? Look at the Numbers!&#8221;</b></font></a></p><p></p>
<p>
For March - another release of
<a href="http://www.dwheeler.com/oss_fs_why.html">&#8220;Why Open Source Software /
Free Software (OSS/FS, FLOSS, FOSS)? Look at the Numbers!&#8221;</a>
I made many changes, here are some of the highlights:
<ol>
<li>
I modified the introduction section to create subsections in it
(it was getting too long to read without some breaking up).
Since I was modifying the intro anyway, I added
to it some evidence that this paper is worth
reading (e.g., the reference to it by the state of California).
I highlighted &#8220;commons-based peer production&#8221;
<a href="http://www.benkler.org/CoasesPenguin.html">Coase&#8217;s Penguin</a>,
a new reference, as part of a new section on the &#8220;bigger picture&#8221;.
I also mentioned there the &#8220;freedom to tinker&#8221; and Wikipedia.
<li>
Added reference to Bruce Perens&#8217;
<a href="http://perens.com/Articles/Economic.html">
The Emerging Economic Paradigm of Open Source</a></a></a>
<li>
<a href="http://www.osdllinuxsummit.org/presentations/tut3(Final)_Copenhaver_Reviewing%20Use%20of%20OSS%20in%20the%20Enterprise.pdf">
Added reference to Black Duck presentation on OSS/FS</a>
<li>
Added a quote from Craig Mundie, who in a moment of honesty
admitted that for many years Microsoft had been much more
interested in functionality than security.
Hopefully this is changing, but I believe it&#8217;ll take years to
really address that.
In any case, I think this explains much of where they&#8217;ve been, though
hopefully not where they&#8217;re going.
<li>
Noted Novell/SUSE met CAPP/EAL4+, according to Government Computer News.
<li>
Added references to some common starting places,
such as the OpenCD (with OpenOffice.org and Firefox), Gnoppix, Knoppix.
<li>
Tweaked the text about self-sponsored &#8220;studies&#8221;, which I don&#8217;t
have a lot of respect for.
I noted a wonderful Steve Taylor phrase from
the song &#8220;Meat the Press&#8221; &#8212; it&#8217;s a phrase I always
think of when I think about that text.  It is:
&#8220;They can state the facts while telling a lie.&#8221;
<li>
Changed any &#8220;Open Office&#8221; to &#8220;OpenOffice.org&#8221;.
The latter is the official name, due to trademark issues.
