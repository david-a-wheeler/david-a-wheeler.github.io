<p><a name="oss-why-20040930"><font size="+2"><b>End of September 2004 release of &#8220;Why OSS/FS? Look at the Numbers!&#8221;</b></font></a></p><p></p>
I&#8217;ve made another release of my paper
<a href="http://www.dwheeler.com/oss_fs_why.html">&#8220;Why Open Source Software /
Free Software (OSS/FS)? Look at the Numbers!&#8221;</a>
Here are some highlights:
<ol>
<li>
Possibly most important long-term, I added a lot of
<a href="http://www.dwheeler.com/oss_fs_why.html#definitions">material
to appendix A to help people identify what is really OSS/FS</a>.
In particular, I added information about Debian&#8217;s tests, which are
thought experiments they use to examine licenses.
These are the &#8220;desert island&#8221;, &#8220;dissident&#8221;, and &#8220;tentacles of evil&#8221; tests.
I added this information after reading
<a href="http://www.imc.org/ietf-mxcomp/mail-archive/msg03514.html">
Mark Shewmaker&#8217;s August 2004 examination of the
Microsoft Royalty Free Sender ID Patent License</a>.
That analysis proved to me that a non-lawyer can carefully
analyze and rationally argue about licensing and legal issues,
especially when they&#8217;re given tools like these thought experiments
to help them.
<li>
I added a reference to the article
&#8220;Open Source Software Development Should Strive for Even Greater
Code Maintainability&#8221; by
Ioannis Samoladas, Ioannis Stamelos, Lefteris Angelis,
and Apostolos Oikonomou.
It&#8217;s published by the
highly-respected &#8220;Communications of the ACM&#8221; (CACM) in
October 2004 (pp. 83-87).
They studied almost 6 million lines of code, tracking several programs
over time, using the maintainability index
(chosen by the Software Engineering Institute as the most suitable tool
for measuring the maintainability of systems).
Using their measurements,
they concluded that
OSS/FS &#8220;code quality appears to be at least equal and sometimes better
than the quality of [closed source software] code implementing
the same functionality.&#8221;
They conjectured that this
&#8220;may be due to the motivation of skilled OSS programmers&#8230;&#8221;

<li>
Added more information about security evaluations performed
or being performed for OSS/FS, esp. Common Criteria and FIPS 140,
in the security section.  Novell SuSE, Red Hat, MandrakeSoft,
Trusted Computer Solutions&#8217; Secure Linux, and OpenSSL
(2 different projects!).
These are really important to some organizations.
Although there&#8217;s a lot of information about this,
there doesn&#8217;t seem to be any one place with it pulled together.
Well, now there is.
<a href="http://www.dwheeler.com/oss_fs_why.html#security-evaluations">See
my paper for more about formal security evaluations of OSS/FS products.</a>

<li>
Added a reference to CSC&#8217;s new report
<a href="http://www.csc.com/features/2004/uploads/LEF_OPENSOURCE.pdf">
&#8220;Open Source: Open for Business&#8221;</a>.
In particular, they discuss some TCO issues which I added to
the TCO section.
