<p>
There&#8217;s a move afoot to argue that copyright infringement penalties should
bear a rational relationship to the value of what was infringed.
You <i>might</i> think that this could harm Free/Libre/Open Source Software
(FLOSS), but I don&#8217;t think so.  
Here&#8217;s why.
</p>
<p>
First: This is all being brought to a head by the
current file-sharing lawsuit against Boston University graduate student
Joel Tenenbaum, which raises a number of interesting questions.
One issue that I find particularly interesting is the issue of
statutory damages:
Are fines from $750 to $150,000 per song (worth at most $1),
non-commercially shared without permission, even legal under the
US Constitution?
Or, are these fines so excessive that they are unconstitutional?
<a href="http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/news/2009/03/obama-admin-nothing-wrong-with-statutory-damages.ars">
Ars Technical gives a brief summary of the case</a>, if you haven&#8217;t
been following it.
The
<a href="http://beckermanlegal.com/pdf/?file=/Lawyer_Copyright_Internet_Law/sony_tenenbaum_090320FSFAmicusBrief.pdf">
Free Software Foundation (FSF)&#8217;s
Amicus Brief in Connection with defendant&#8217;s motion to dismiss on grounds of unconstitutionality
of copyright act statutory damages as applied
to infringement of single MP3 files</a>
argues that these penalties grossly exceed the crime;
the FSF argues that the
&#8220;State Farm/Gore due process test applicable to punitive damage awards
is likewise applicable to statutory damages, and in particular bars
the suggestion that each infringement of an MP3 file having a retail value
of 99 cents or less may be punishable by statutory damages of
from $750 to $150,000 &#8212; or from 2,100 to 425,000 times the actual damages&#8221;.
</p>
<p>
Frankly, I think the FSF and Tenenbaum have a reasonable argument on this point.
People who shoplift a CD from a store would definitely pay penalties when
caught, but those penalties would bear some relationship to the value of the
property stolen, and would be <i>far</i> smaller than a file-sharer.
This notion that the &#8220;punishment should fit the crime&#8221; is certainly not new;
Proverbs 6:30-31 talks about thieves paying sevenfold if they are caught.
That doesn&#8217;t make such actions <i>right</i> - but unjust 
penalties aren&#8217;t right either.
I think a lot of the problem is that copyright laws were originally
written when only rich people with printing presses could really
make and distribute many copies of material.
Today,
8-year-olds can distribute as much information as the New York Times, and
the law hasn&#8217;t caught up.
</p>
<p>
But does the FSF risk subverting Free/Libre/Open Source Software (FLOSS)
by making this argument?
After all, FLOSS developers also depend on copyright law to enforce
certain conditions, and often charge $0 for copies of their software.
If the penalties would be limited to &#8220;7 times the original cost&#8221;,
would that make FLOSS development impossible?
</p>
<p>
I don&#8217;t think there&#8217;s any problem, but for some people that may not be obvious.
The difference is that in a typical music copyright infringement case,
the filesharer <i>could</i> purchase the right to do what they&#8217;re doing for
a relatively low price, something typically <i>not</i> true for FLOSS.
For example, under normal circumstances
it&#8217;s perfectly legal to buy a song for $1, and then transfer that
song to someone else (as long as you destroy your own copies),
so sharing that song with 10 people is legal after paying $10.
</p>
<p>
In contrast, violations of FLOSS licenses often can&#8217;t be made
legal by simply buying the rights.
If you violate the revised BSD license by removing all credits to the
original author, there&#8217;s typically no &#8220;alternative&#8221; legal
version available for sale without the author credits.
(Indeed, under legal systems with strict &#8220;moral rights&#8221; it may not even be
possible.)
Similarly, if you violate the GPL by releasing binary software yet
refusing to release its source code,
there&#8217;s often no way to pay additional money
to the original authors for that privilege.
In <i>some</i> cases, GPL&#8217;ed software is released via a dual-use license
(e.g., &#8220;GPL or proprietary&#8221;), with the proprietary version costing additional
money; in <i>those</i> cases you <i>do</i> have a
value that you can compare against.
In cases where there <i>is</i> a value you can compare against, then
you should use that value to help determine the penalty.
Otherwise, a much stiffer penalty is justified, because there is no
method for the infringer to &#8220;buy&#8221; his or her way out, and their
actions risk making functional products (not just entertainment) unsupportable.
As noted in the
<a href="http://www.cafc.uscourts.gov/opinions/08-1001.pdf">
United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit case 2008-1001,
JACOBSEN v. KATZER</a>,
the court essentially
found that failing to obey the conditions of an open source software
license led to copyright infringement.
(For more on this particular case,
see <a href="http://lawandlifesiliconvalley.blogspot.com/2007/08/new-open-source-legal-decision-jacobsen.html">New Open Source Legal Decision: Jacobsen &amp; Katzer and How Model Train Software Will Have an Important Effect on Open Source Licensing</a>.)
</p>
<p>
So I think that it <i>does</i> make sense to limit copyright
penalties based on the value of the original infringed item&#8230; but
that doing so does not (necessarily) put FLOSS development processes
at risk.
