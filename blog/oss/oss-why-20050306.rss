&lt;p&gt;
For March - another release of
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dwheeler.com/oss_fs_why.html&quot;&gt;&amp;#8220;Why Open Source Software /
Free Software (OSS/FS, FLOSS, FOSS)? Look at the Numbers!&amp;#8221;&lt;/a&gt;
I made many changes, here are some of the highlights:
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
I modified the introduction section to create subsections in it
(it was getting too long to read without some breaking up).
Since I was modifying the intro anyway, I added
to it some evidence that this paper is worth
reading (e.g., the reference to it by the state of California).
I highlighted &amp;#8220;commons-based peer production&amp;#8221;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.benkler.org/CoasesPenguin.html&quot;&gt;Coase&amp;#8217;s Penguin&lt;/a&gt;,
a new reference, as part of a new section on the &amp;#8220;bigger picture&amp;#8221;.
I also mentioned there the &amp;#8220;freedom to tinker&amp;#8221; and Wikipedia.
&lt;li&gt;
Added reference to Bruce Perens&amp;#8217;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://perens.com/Articles/Economic.html&quot;&gt;
The Emerging Economic Paradigm of Open Source&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.osdllinuxsummit.org/presentations/tut3(Final)_Copenhaver_Reviewing%20Use%20of%20OSS%20in%20the%20Enterprise.pdf&quot;&gt;
Added reference to Black Duck presentation on OSS/FS&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
Added a quote from Craig Mundie, who in a moment of honesty
admitted that for many years Microsoft had been much more
interested in functionality than security.
Hopefully this is changing, but I believe it&amp;#8217;ll take years to
really address that.
In any case, I think this explains much of where they&amp;#8217;ve been, though
hopefully not where they&amp;#8217;re going.
&lt;li&gt;
Noted Novell/SUSE met CAPP/EAL4+, according to Government Computer News.
&lt;li&gt;
Added references to some common starting places,
such as the OpenCD (with OpenOffice.org and Firefox), Gnoppix, Knoppix.
&lt;li&gt;
Tweaked the text about self-sponsored &amp;#8220;studies&amp;#8221;, which I don&amp;#8217;t
have a lot of respect for.
I noted a wonderful Steve Taylor phrase from
the song &amp;#8220;Meat the Press&amp;#8221; &amp;#8212; it&amp;#8217;s a phrase I always
think of when I think about that text.  It is:
&amp;#8220;They can state the facts while telling a lie.&amp;#8221;
&lt;li&gt;
Changed any &amp;#8220;Open Office&amp;#8221; to &amp;#8220;OpenOffice.org&amp;#8221;.
The latter is the official name, due to trademark issues.
&lt;/ol&gt;
