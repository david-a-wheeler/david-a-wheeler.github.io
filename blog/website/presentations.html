<p>
I&#8217;m still giving a presentation at NovaLUG, but the
date has been changed from July 1 to July 8 (2006).
This is because July 4 is a U.S. holiday (independence day),
and there was concern that some people might not be able to come.
So it will now be July 8, 10am,
&#8220;Free-Libre/Open Source Software (FLOSS) and Security&#8221;.
Washington Technology Park/CSC (formerly Dyncorp),
15000 Conference Center Drive, Chantilly, VA.

<p>
This has convinced me that I need a page to help people
find when and where I&#8217;m speaking, so that they don&#8217;t have to
march through my blogs to get the information.
So here it is&#8230;
