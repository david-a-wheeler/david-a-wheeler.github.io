<p><a name="wikipedia-research"><font size="+2"><b>Using Wikipedia for research</b></font></a></p><p></p>
<p>
Some teachers seem to lose their minds when asked about
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org">Wikipedia</a>,
and make absurd rules like
<a href="http://modeltrains.about.com/od/railroads/tp/Wikipedia.htm">
&#8220;I forbid students from using Wikipedia&#8221;</a>.
<a href="http://en.kioskea.net/news/10362-once-shunned-by-academics-wikipedia-now-a-teaching-tool">A 2008 article</a>
states that Wikipedia is the encyclopedia
&#8220;that most universities forbid students to use&#8221;.
</p>
<p>
But the professors don&#8217;t need to be such Luddites; it turns out
that college students tend to use Wikipedia quite appropriately.
A research paper titled
<a href="http://www.uic.edu/htbin/cgiwrap/bin/ojs/index.php/fm/article/view/2830/2476">
<i>How today&#8217;s college students use Wikipedia for
course-related research</i></a>
examines Wikipedia use among college students; it found that
Wikipedia use was widespread, and that
the primary reason they used Wikipedia was to
obtain background information or a summary about a topic.
Most respondents reported using Wikipedia at the beginning
of the research process; very few used Wikipedia near or at the end.
In focus group sessions, students described Wikipedia as
&#8220;the very beginning of the very beginning for me&#8221; or
&#8220;a .5 step in my research process&#8221;, and that it helps primarily in the
beginning because it provided a
&#8220;simple narrative that gives you a grasp&#8221;.
Another focus group participant called Wikipedia &#8220;my presearch tool&#8221;.
Presearch, as the participant defined it, was &#8220;the stage of research
where students initially figure out a topic, find out about it, and
delineate it&#8221;.
</p>
<p>
Now, it&#8217;s perfectly reasonable to say that Wikipedia should not
be cited as an original source;
I have no trouble with professors making <i>that</i> rule.
Wikipedia itself has a rule that
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:No_original_research">
Wikipedia does not publish original research or original thought</a>.
Indeed, the same is true for <i>Encyclopedia Britannica</i>
or any other encyclopedia;
encyclopedias are supposed to be <i>summaries</i> of knowledge gained
elsewhere.
You would expect that college work would normally <i>not</i> have
many citations of any encyclopedia, be it Wikipedia or
Encyclopedia Britannica, simply because encyclopedias
are <i>not</i> original sources.
</p>
<p>
Rather than running in fear from new materials and techologies,
teachers should be helping students understand how to use them appropriately,
helping them consider the strengths and weaknesses of their
information sources.
Wikipedia should not be the end of any serious research,
but it&#8217;s a reasonable place to start.
You should supplement it with other material, for the simple reason that
you should <i>always</i> examine multiple sources no matter where you start,
but that doesn&#8217;t make Wikipedia less valuable.
For younger students, there are reasonable concerns about inappropriate
material (e.g., due to Wikipedia vandalism and because Wikipedia covers topics
not appropriate for much younger readers), but the derivative
<a href="http://schools-wikipedia.org/">
&#8220;Wikipedia Selection for Schools&#8221;</a> 
is a good solution for that problem.
I&#8217;m delighted that so much information is available to people everywhere;
we need to help people <i>use</i>
these resources instead of <i>ignoring</i> them.
</p>
<p>
And speaking of which, if you like Wikipedia, please help!
With a little effort, you can make it better for everyone.
In particular, Wikipedia needs more video;
please help the
<a href="http://videoonwikipedia.org/index.html">Video on Wikipedia</a>
folks get more videos on Wikipedia.
This also helps the cause of open video, ensuring that the
Internet continues to be open to innovation.

<p><a name="robocopy"><font size="+2"><b>Robocopy</b></font></a></p><p></p>
<p>
If you use Microsoft Windows (XP or some later version),
and don&#8217;t have an allergic
reaction to the command line, you should know about
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robocopy">Robocopy</a>.
Robocopy (&#8220;robust file copy&#8221;) is a command-line program from
Microsoft that copies collections of files from one place to
another in an efficient way. Robocopy is included in Windows
Vista, Windows 7, and Windows Server 2008. Windows XP and Windows
Server 2003 users can download Robocopy for free from Microsoft
as part of the
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/en/confirmation.aspx?familyId=9d467a69-57ff-4ae7-96ee-b18c4790cffd&displayLang=en">
Windows Server 2003 &#8220;Resource Kit Tools&#8221;</a>.
</p>
<p>
Robocopy copies files, like the COPY command,
but Robocopy will only copy a file if the source and destination
have different time stamps or different file sizes.
Robocopy is nowhere near as capable as the Unix/Linux &#8220;rsync&#8221; command,
but for some tasks it suffices.  Robocopy will not copy files that
are currently open (by default it will repeatedly retry copying them),
it can only do one-way mirroring (not bi-directional synchronization),
it can only copy mounted filesystems, and it&#8217;s foolish about how it copies
across a network (it copies the whole file, not just the changed parts).
Anyway, you invoke it at the command line like this:
<pre>
ROBOCOPY Source Destination OPTIONS
</pre>
</p>
<p>
So, here&#8217;s an example of copying everything from &#8220;c:\data&#8221; to &#8220;q:\data&#8221;:
<pre>
 robocopy c:\data u:\data /MIR /NDL /R:20
</pre>
</p>
<p>
To do this on an automated schedule in Windows XP,
put your commands into a text file with a name ending in &#8220;.bat&#8221; and
select Control Panel-&gt; Scheduled Tasks-&gt; Add Scheduled Task.
Select your text file to run, have it run &#8220;daily&#8221;.
You would think that you can&#8217;t run it more than once a day this way,
but that&#8217;s actually not true.
Click on &#8220;Open advanced properties for this task when I click Finish&#8221;
and then press Finish. Now select the &#8220;Schedule&#8221; tab.
Set it to start at some time when you&#8217;re probably using the computer,
click on &#8220;Advanced&#8221;, and set &#8220;repeat task&#8221; so it will run (say, every hour
with a duration of 2 hours).
Then click on &#8220;Show multiple schedules&#8221;, click &#8220;new&#8221;,
and then select &#8220;At system startup&#8221;.
Now it will make copies on startup AND every hour.
You may want to go to the &#8220;Settings&#8221; tab and tweak it further.
You can use Control Panel-&gt; Scheduled tasks
to change the schedule or other settings.
</p>
<p>
<a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/2006.11.utilityspotlight.aspx"> A GUI for Robocopy is available</a>.
An alternative to Robocopy is
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SyncToy">SyncToy</a>; SyncToy
has a GUI, but Microsoft won&#8217;t support it,
I&#8217;ve had reliability and speed problems with it, and
SyncToy has a nasty bug in its &#8220;Echo&#8221; mode&#8230; so I don&#8217;t use it.
I suspect the Windows Vista and Windows 7 synchronization tools might
make Robocopy a less useful, but I find that
the Windows XP synchronization tools are terrible&#8230; making
using Robocopy a better approach.
There are a boatload of applications out there that do one-way or two-way
mirroring, including ports of rsync, but getting them installed in some
security-conscious organizations can be difficult.
</p>
<p>
Of course, if you&#8217;re using Unix/Linux, then use rsync and be happy.
Rsync usually comes with Unix/Linux, and
rsync is leaps-and-bounds better than robocopy.
But not everyone has that option.
