<p>
Nearly all operating systems have a simple
command to open up a file, directory, or URL from the command line.
This is useful when you&#8217;re using the command line, e.g.,
<tt>xdg-open .</tt> will pop up a window in the current directory
on most Unix/Linux systems.
This capability is also handy when you&#8217;re writing
a program, because these are
easy to invoke from almost any language.
You can then pass it a filename (to open that file using the
default application for that file type), a directory name to start
navigating in that directory (use &#8220;.&#8221; for the current directory),
or a URL like &#8220;http://www.dwheeler.com&#8221; to open
a browser at that URL.

<p>
Unfortunately, the command to do this is different on different platforms.

<p>
My new essay
<a href="http://www.dwheeler.com/essays/open-files-urls.html">
<b>How to easily open files and URLs from the command line</b></a>
shows how to do this.
</p>
<p>
For example, on Unix/Linux systems, you should use xdg-open
(not gnome-open or kde-open), because that opens the right application
given the user&#8217;s current environment.
On MacOS, the command is &#8220;open&#8221;.
On Windows you should use start
(not explorer, because invoking explorer directly will ignore the user&#8217;s
default browser setting), while on
Cygwin, the command is &#8220;cygstart&#8221;.
More details are in the essay, including some gotchas and warnings.
