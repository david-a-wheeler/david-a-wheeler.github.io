&#8220;How to Stop Worrying and Learn to Love the Internet&#8221;</a>.
It&#8217;s a wonderful essay that is still a good read today.
In particular, I think it&#8217;s an important article to read
if you&#8217;re still struggling with understanding where the Internet is going,
or if you&#8217;re trying to figure out how to address the trustworthiness 
of group-developed information like
<a href="http://www.dwheeler.com/blog/2010/03/21/#wikipedia-research">Wikipedia</a>,
<a href="http://www.dwheeler.com/oss_fs_why.html">open source software</a>,
or the blogosphere.

&#8220;Because the Internet is so new we still don&#8217;t really
understand what it is. We mistake it for a type of publishing or
broadcasting, because that&#8217;s what we&#8217;re used to. So people
complain that there&#8217;s a lot of rubbish online, or that it&#8217;s
dominated by Americans, or that you can&#8217;t necessarily trust what you
read on the web. Imagine trying to apply any of those criticisms to what
you hear on the telephone. Of course you can&#8217;t &#8216;trust&#8217;
what people tell you on the web anymore than you can &#8216;trust&#8217;
what people tell you on megaphones, postcards or in restaurants. Working
out the social politics of who you can trust and why is, quite literally,
what a very large part of our brain has evolved to do. For some batty
reason we turn off this natural scepticism when we see things in any
medium which require a lot of work or resources to work in, or in which
we can&#8217;t easily answer back &mdash; like newspapers, television
or granite. Hence &#8216;carved in stone.&#8217; What should concern us
is not that we can&#8217;t take what we read on the internet on trust &mdash;
of course you can&#8217;t, it&#8217;s just people talking &mdash;
but that we ever got into the <i>dangerous habit of believing
what we read in the newspapers or saw on the TV [emphasis mine]</i>  &mdash; a mistake
that no one who has met an actual journalist would ever make&#8230;
Interactivity. Many-to-many communications. Pervasive networking. These
are cumbersome new terms for elements in our lives so fundamental that,
before we lost them, we didn&#8217;t even know to have names for them.&#8221;
