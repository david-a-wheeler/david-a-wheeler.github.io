&lt;p&gt;
Some people are claiming that the U.S. federal government law
called the &amp;#8220;antideficiency act&amp;#8221; means that the U.S. government cannot
use any software released under the Apache 2.0 license.
This is nonsense, but it&amp;#8217;s a good example of the nonsense that
impedes government use and co-development of some great software.
Here&amp;#8217;s why this is nonsense.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
First, I should note that in my earlier post,
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dwheeler.com/blog/2012/06/24/#volunteer-open-source-antideficiency&quot;&gt;Open Source Software volunteers forbidden in government? (Antideficiency Act)&lt;/a&gt;,
I explained that the US government rule called the
&amp;#8220;antideficiency act&amp;#8221; (ADA)
doesn&amp;#8217;t interfere with the government&amp;#8217;s use of open source software (OSS),
even if it is created by people who are &amp;#8220;volunteers&amp;#8221;.
As long as the volunteers intend or agree that their work is
gratuitous (no-charge), there&amp;#8217;s no problem.
The antideficiency act says that you can&amp;#8217;t create a moral obligation
to pay without Congress&amp;#8217; consent; the government &lt;i&gt;can&lt;/i&gt;
accept materials even if they are provided at no cost.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gao.gov/legal/lawresources/antideficiencybackground.html&quot;&gt;GAO has a summary describing the Antideficiency Act (ADA), Pub.L. 97-258, 96 Stat. 923&lt;/a&gt;.
It explains that the ADA prohibits &amp;#8220;federal employees from:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;making or authorizing an expenditure from, or creating or authorizing an obligation under, any appropriation or fund in excess of the amount available in the appropriation or fund unless authorized by law. 31 U.S.C. ยง 1341(a)(1)(A).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;involving the government in any obligation to pay money before funds have been appropriated for that purpose, unless otherwise allowed by law. 31 U.S.C. ยง 1341(a)(1)(B).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;accepting voluntary services for the United States, or employing personal services not authorized by law, except in cases of emergency involving the safety of human life or the protection of property. 31 U.S.C. ยง 1342.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;making obligations or expenditures in excess of an apportionment or reapportionment, or in excess of the amount permitted by agency regulations. 31 U.S.C. ยง 1517(a).&amp;#8221;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Software licenses sometimes include indemnification clauses, and those clauses can run afoul of this act if the clauses require the government to grant a possibly unlimited future liability (or any liability not already appropriated).
But some lawyers act
as if the word &amp;#8220;indemnification&amp;#8221; is some kind of magic curse word.
The word &amp;#8220;indemnification&amp;#8221; is not a magic word that makes a licenses
automatically unacceptable for government use.
As always, whether a license is okay or not depends on what
the license actually says.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The license that seems to trigger problems in some lawyers is the
Apache 2.0 license, a popular OSS license.
Yet the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html&quot;&gt;Apache
license version 2.0&lt;/a&gt; does not require such broad indemnification.
The Apache 2.0 license clause 9 (&amp;#8220;Accepting Warranty or Additional
Liability&amp;#8221;) instead requires that a redistributor provide indemnification
&lt;i&gt;only&lt;/i&gt; when additional conditions are met - in this case, when
the redistributor provides warranty or indemnification.  Clause 9 says
in full, &amp;#8220;While redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof,
You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support,
warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights
consistent with this License. However, in accepting such obligations,
You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not
on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by,
or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your accepting
any such warranty or additional liability.&amp;#8221;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
In short (and to oversimplify), &amp;#8220;if you indemnify your downstream
(recipients), you have to indemnify your upstream
(those you received it from)&amp;#8221;.
There is a reason for clauses like this; it
helps counter some clever sheanigans by
competitors who might want to harm a project.
If a competitor set up a situation to legally protect that software&amp;#8217;s users
while legally exposing its developers to heightened risk,
after a while there would be no developers.
This clause prevents this.
(This is yet another example of
why you should reuse a widely-used OSS license instead of
writing your own; most people would never have thought of this issue.)
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
It is extremely unlikely that any government agency would trigger
this clause by warrantying the software or indemnifying a recipient,
so it is quite unlikely that this clause would ever be triggered by
government action.  But in any case, it would be this later action,
not mere acceptance of the Apache 2.0 license, that would potentially
run afoul of the ADA.  This is simply the same as usual; the government
typically does not warranty or indemnify software it releases, and if it
did, it would have to determine that value and lawfully receive funding
to do it.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
There&amp;#8217;s an additional wrinkle on this stuff.
The legal field, like the software field, is so large that many people
specialize, and sometimes the right specialists don&amp;#8217;t get involved.
Reviewing software licenses is normally the domain of so-called
&amp;#8220;intellectual property&amp;#8221; lawyers, who really should be called
&amp;#8220;data rights&amp;#8221; lawyers.
(I&amp;#8217;ve commented elsewhere that
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dwheeler.com/essays/intellectual-rights-not-intellectual-property.html&quot;&gt;the term &amp;#8220;intellectual property&amp;#8221; is dangerously misleading&lt;/a&gt;,
but that is a different topic.)
But I&amp;#8217;ve been told that at least in some organizations, the
people who really understand the antideficiency act are a different
group of lawyers (e.g., those who specialize in finance).
So if a data rights lawyer comes back with antideficiency act questions,
find out if that lawyer is the right person to talk to; it may be that the
question really should be forwarded to a lawyer who specializes
in that instead.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Now I am no lawyer, and this blog post is not legal advice.
Even if I were a lawyer, I am not &lt;i&gt;your&lt;/i&gt; lawyer &amp;mdash; specific
facts can create weird situations.
There is no formal ruling on this matter, either, more&amp;#8217;s the pity.
However, this conclusion that I&amp;#8217;m describing
has been previously reached by others, in particular, see
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fiercegovernmentit.com/story/army-lawyers-dismiss-apache-license-indemnification-snafu/2012-03-08?utm_medium=nl&amp;utm_source=internal&quot;&gt;
&amp;#8220;Army lawyers dismiss Apache license indemnification snafu&amp;#8221;, Fierce
Government IT, March 8, 2012&lt;/a&gt;.
What&amp;#8217;s more, other lawyers I&amp;#8217;ve talked
to have agreed that this makes sense.
Basically, the word &amp;#8220;indemification&amp;#8221; is not
a magic curse word when it is in a licence &amp;mdash;
you have to actually read the license, and then determine if it is
a problem or not.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
More broadly, this is (yet another) example of a misunderstanding in the
U.S. federal government that impedes the use and collaborative
development of open source software (aka OSS or FLOSS).
I believe
the U.S. federal government does not use or co-develop OSS to the extent
that it should, and in some cases it is
because of misunderstandings like this.
So if this matters to you, spread the word &amp;mdash; often rules that
appear to be problems are not problems at all.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I&amp;#8217;ve put this information in the
&lt;a href=&quot;http://mil-oss.org/learn-more/frequently-asked-questions-on-open-source-software-oss&quot;&gt;MIL-OSS FAQ&lt;/a&gt; so others can find out about this.

    <title>Open Source Software volunteers forbidden in government? (Antideficiency Act)</title>
    <link>http://www.dwheeler.com/blog/2012/06/24#volunteer-open-source-antideficiency</link>

    <description>
&lt;p&gt;
Sometimes people ask me if open source software (OSS) is forbidden in the U.S. federal government due to a prohibition on &amp;#8220;voluntary services&amp;#8221;.  Often they don&amp;#8217;t even know exactly where this prohibition is in law, they just heard third-hand that there was some problem.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
It turns out that there is no problem, as I will explain. Please spread the word to those who care!  Even if this isn&amp;#8217;t your specific problem, I think this question can provide some general lessons about how to deal with government laws and regulations that, on first reading, do not make sense.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The issue here is something called the &amp;#8220;antideficiency act&amp;#8221; (ADA), specifically the part of the ADA in
&lt;a href=&quot;http://uscode.house.gov/uscode-cgi/fastweb.exe?getdoc+uscview+t29t32+1830+0++%28%29%20%20AND%20%28%2831%29%20ADJ%20USC%29%3ACITE%20AND%20%28USC%20w%2F10%20%281342%29%29%3ACITE%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20&quot;&gt;31 U.S.C. &amp;sect; 1342, Limitation on voluntary services&lt;/a&gt;.  This statute says that, &amp;#8220;An officer or employee of the United States Government or of the District of Columbia government may not accept voluntary services for either government or employ personal services exceeding that authorized by law except for emergencies involving the safety of human life or the protection of property&amp;#8230;&amp;#8221;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Now at first glance, this text could appear to forbid OSS. Historically, OSS was developed by volunteers, and a lot of OSS is still created by people who aren&amp;#8217;t paid to write it.  A lot of OSS developers are paid to write software today, often at a premium, but that doesn&amp;#8217;t help either.  After all, often the government is not the one paying for the development, so at first glance this still sounds like &amp;#8220;volunteer&amp;#8221; work. After all, the company who is paying is still &amp;#8220;volunteering&amp;#8221; the software to the government!
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
In fact, it&amp;#8217;s even worse.  It appears to forbid the government
from working with volunteer organizations like the Red Cross.
In fact, it becomes hard to imagine how the government can work with
various non-government organizations (NGOs) &amp;mdash; most depend greatly
on volunteers!
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
But as is often the case, if there&amp;#8217;s a government law or regulation that doesn&amp;#8217;t make sense, you should dig deeper to find out what it actually means.  Often there are court cases or official guidance documents that explain things, and often you&amp;#8217;ll find out that the law or regulation means something very different than you might expect.  I&amp;#8217;ve found that in the US government (or in law), the problems are often caused because a key term doesn&amp;#8217;t mean what you might expect it to mean.  In this case, the word &amp;#8220;voluntary&amp;#8221; does not mean what you might think it means.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gao.gov/legal/redbook/redbook.html&quot;&gt;US Government Accountability Office (GAO) Office of the General Counsel&amp;#8217;s &amp;#8220;Principles of Federal Appropriations Law&amp;#8221; (aka the &amp;#8220;Red Book&amp;#8221;)&lt;/a&gt; explains federal appropriation law.  Volume II of its third edition, section 6.C.3, describes in detail this prohibition on voluntary services.  Section 6.C.3.a notes that the voluntary services provision is not new; it first appeared, in almost identical form, back in 1884.  The red book explains its purpose; since &amp;#8220;an agency cannot directly obligate in excess or advance of its appropriations, it should not be able to accomplish the same thing indirectly by accepting ostensibly &amp;#8216;voluntary&amp;#8217; services and then presenting Congress with the bill, in the hope that Congress will recognize a &amp;#8216;moral obligation&amp;#8217; to pay for the benefits conferred&amp;#8230;&amp;#8221;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The red book section 6.C.3.b states that in 1913, the Attorney General developed an opinion (30 Op. Att&amp;#8217;y Gen. 51 (1913)) that &amp;#8220;has become the leading case construing 31 U.S.C. ยง 1342&amp;#8230; the Attorney General drew a distinction that the Comptroller of the Treasury thereafter adopted, and that GAO and the Justice Department continue to follow to this day: &amp;#8221;the distinction between &amp;#8216;voluntary services&amp;#8217; and &amp;#8216;gratuitous services.&amp;#8217;&amp;#8221;  Some key text from this opinion, as identified by the red book, are: &amp;#8220;[I]t seems plain that the words &amp;#8216;voluntary service&amp;#8217; were not intended to be synonymous with &amp;#8216;gratuitous service&amp;#8217; &amp;#8230; it is evident that the evil at which Congress was aiming was not appointment or employment for authorized services without compensation, but the acceptance of unauthorized services not intended or agreed to be gratuitous and therefore likely to afford a basis for a future claim upon Congress&amp;#8230; .&amp;#8221;  More recent decisions, such as the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gao.gov/assets/450/441639.pdf&quot;&gt;1982 decision B-204326 by the U.S. Comptroller General&lt;/a&gt;, continue to confirm this distinction between &amp;#8220;gratuitous&amp;#8221; and &amp;#8220;voluntary&amp;#8221; service.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
So here we have a word (&amp;#8220;voluntary&amp;#8221;) that has a very special meaning in these regulations that is different from its usual meaning.  I expect that a lot of the problem is that this word dates from 1884; words their meaning change over time.  And changing laws is hard; lawmakers rarely change a text just because it&amp;#8217;s hard for ordinary people to understand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
In short, the ADA&amp;#8217;s limitation on voluntary services does not broadly forbid the government from working with organizations and people who identify themselves as volunteers, including those who develop OSS.
Instead, the ADA prohibits government employees from accepting services that are not intended or agreed to be given freely (gratuitous), but were instead rendered in the hope that Congress will subsequently recognize a moral obligation to pay for the benefits conferred.
Services that are intended and agreed to be gratuitous do not conflict with this statute.  In most cases, contributors to OSS projects intend for their contributions to be gratuitous, and provide them for all (not just for the Federal government), clearly distinguishing such OSS contributions from the &amp;#8220;voluntary services&amp;#8221; that the ADA was designed to prevent.
&lt;/p&gt;
