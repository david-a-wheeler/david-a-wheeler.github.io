<i>
In some
<a href="http://www.dwheeler.com/essays/dod-oss.pdf">presentations</a> I
include the &#8220;magic cookie parable&#8221;.
Here is the parable, for those who have not heard it
(I usually hold a cookie in my hand when I present it).
Anyway&#8230;
</i>
</p>

<div style="color:#6600CC ; font-size: 120%">
<p>
I have in my hand&#8230; a magic cookie!
Just one cookie will supply all your food needs for a whole year.
What is more, the first one is only $1.
Imagine how much money you will save!
Imagine how much time you will save!
</p>

<p>
Ah, but there&#8217;s a catch.
Once you eat the magic cookie, you can <i>only</i> eat
magic cookies, as all other food will become poisonous to you.
What&#8217;s more, there is only one manufacturer of magic cookies.
</p>

<p>
Do you think the cookie will be $1 next year?
How about for the rest of your life?
Are you as eager to eat the cookie?
</p>
</div>

<p>
Is that a silly parable?
It should be.
Yet many people accept information technology (IT),
for themselves or on behalf of
their organizations, that are fundamentally magic cookies.
Too many are blinded into accepting technology that makes them, or their
organization, completely at the mercy of a single supplier.
You can call dependence on single supplier a security problem,
or a supply chain problem, or a support problem, or many other things.
But no matter what you call it, it is a serious problem.
</p>

<p>
Now please do not hear what I am not saying.
I am not here to attack any particular supplier.
In fact, we all need suppliers, and
I am grateful for suppliers!
The problem is not the existence of suppliers; the problem is
excessive dependency on any one supplier.
</p>

<p>
There are only a few information technology (IT)
strategies that counter sole-supplier dependency that I know of:
<ol>
<li>Build and control it yourself.
In a few cases this is reasonable, but in most cases, that is too expensive
and it risks obsolescence.</li>
<li>Open systems/open standards.  Here, you ensure that your system is
made of modular parts with key interfaces covered by standards;
that way, you can later switch to a different product.
This can work, but suppliers may create
proprietary extensions that (if you are not careful) lock you in anyway.
</li>Open source software.
Since open source software allows anyone to modify and
redistribute the software, if a supplier goes in a direction you did not like,
you can band together with other customers to ensure a supply of software
that meets your needs.
</li>
<li>A Combination.  That is, a combination of the above.</li>
</ol>
</p>
<p>
Before getting locked into a single supplier, count the true cost
over the entire time it will occur.
Sure, in some cases, it may be worth it anyway.
But you may find that this true cost is far higher than you are willing to pay.

<p><a name="dod-oss-moved-2012"><font size="+2"><b>DoD Open Source Software (OSS) Pages Moved</b></font></a></p><p></p>
<p>
The US Department of Defense (DoD) has changed the URLs for some of
its information on Open Source Software (OSS).
Unfortunately, there are currently no redirects, and that
makes them hard to find (sigh).
Here are new links, if you want them.
</p>
<p>
A good place to start is the
<a href="http://dodcio.defense.gov/Home/Topics/UseofFreeOpenSourceSoftwareFOSS.aspx">Department of Defense (DoD)
Free Open Source Software (FOSS)
Community of Interest page,
hosted by the DoD Chief Information Officer (CIO)</a>.
</p>
<p>
From that page, you can reach:
<ul>
<li><a href="http://dodcio.defense.gov/Portals/0/Documents/FOSS/2009OSS.pdf">Clarifying Guidance Regarding Open Source Software (OSS)
    Memorandum by David M. Wennergren, 16 October 2009</a> - this is the overall DoD policy on OSS
</li>
<li><a href="http://dodcio.defense.gov/Portals/0/Documents/FOSS/OTD-lessons-learned-military-signed.pdf">Open Technology Development (OTD): Lessons Learned &amp; Best Practices for Military Software - OSD Report, May 2011</a> - this is guidance on how to develop and use OSS
</li>
<li><a href="http://dodcio.defense.gov/OpenSourceSoftwareFAQ.aspx" title="DoD Open Source Software Frequently Asked Questions (DoD OSS FAQ)">DoD Open Source Software (OSS) Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)</a> - this has lots of answers to questions about OSS, focusing on DoD issues
</li>
<li><a href="http://dodcio.defense.gov/Portals/0/Documents/FOSS/dodfoss_pdf.pdf">Use of Free and Open-Source Software (FOSS) in the U.S. Department of Defense - 2003 Study by MITRE Corporation performed for DoD</a> - a report by MITRE&#8217;s Terry Bollinger showing that the DoD was already using OSS widely in 2002-2003.  Funny fact: In the Acknowledgements page, I am listed second.
</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
If you are interested in the topic of DoD and OSS, you might also be
interested in the
<a href="http://www.mil-oss.org/">Military Open Source Software (Mil-OSS)</a>
group, which is not a government organization, but is an
active community.

<p><a name="insecure-libraries"><font size="+2"><b>Insecure open source software libraries?</b></font></a></p><p></p>
<p>
The news is abuzz about a new report,
<a href="https://www.aspectsecurity.com/blog/the-unfortunate-reality-of-insecure-libraries/">&#8220;The Unfortunate Reality of Insecure Libraries&#8221; (by Aspect Security, in partnership with Sonatype)</a>.
Some news articles about it, like
<a href="http://www.networkworld.com/news/2012/032612-open-source-vulnerabilities-257645.html">Open source code libraries seen as rife with vulnerabilities (Network World)</a>
make it sound like open source software (OSS) is especially bad.
(To be fair, they do not literally say that, but many readers might
infer it.)
</p>
<p>
However, if you look at the report, you see something quite different.
The report directly states that,
&#8220;This paper is not a critique of open source libraries,
and we caution against interpreting this analysis as such.&#8221;
They only examined open source Java libraries,
but their &#8220;experience in evaluating
the security of hundreds of custom applications indicates that the
findings are likely to apply to closed-source and commercial libraries
as well.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
This is a valuable report, because it points out a general problem
<i>not</i> specific to OSS.
</p>
<p>
The problem is that
<b>software libraries (OSS or not)
are not being adequately managed, leading to a vast
number of vulnerabilities</b>.
For example, the report states that
&#8220;The data show that most organizations do not appear to have a strong process in place for ensuring
that the libraries they rely upon are up-to-date and free from known vulnerabilities.&#8221;
They point out that
&#8220;development teams readily acknowledge, often with some level of embarrassment,
that they make no efforts to keep their libraries up-to-date.&#8221;
They also note that
&#8220;Organizations download many old versions of libraries&#8230;
If people were updating their libraries, we would have expected the popularity of older libraries to drop to zero within the first two years. However, the data clearly show popularity extending back over six years&#8230;.
The continuing popularity of libraries for extended months suggests
that incremental releases of legacy applications are not being updated
to use the latest versions of libraries but are continuing to
use older versions.&#8221;
They recommend that software development organizations inventory,
analyze, control, and monitor their libraries, and give details on each point.
</p>
<p>
I should note that I&#8217;ve been saying some of these things for years.
For years I have said that you should
<a href="http://www.dwheeler.com/oss_fs_eval.html">evaluate OSS before
you use it</a>&#8230; some software is better than others.
Back in 2008 I also urged
<a href="http://www.dwheeler.com/blog/2008/09/19/">developers to
use system libraries</a>, at least as an option;
embedding libraries often leads over time to the use of old (and vulnerable)
libraries.
An advantage of OSS is that many people can review the software,
find problems (including vulnerabilities), and fix them&#8230;
but this advantage is lost if the fixed versions are not used!
And of course, if you develop software, you need to learn
<a href="http://www.dwheeler.com/secure-programs/index.html">how to
develop secure software</a>.
As the report notes, tools can be useful
(I give away <a href="http://www.dwheeler.com/flawfinder/">flawfinder</a>),
but tools cannot replace human knowledge and human review.
</p>
