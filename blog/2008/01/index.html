<p>
I&#8217;m going to present a webinar on
<a href="http://www.dwheeler.com/oss-dod-webinar2008.html">
&#8220;Open Source Software (OSS) and the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD)&#8221;
</a>
on Feb 11, 2008, 3:00-4:30pm EST.
It is open to the public, at no charge.

<p>
Here&#8217;s the summary:
&#8220;Open source software (OSS) has become widespread, but there are many
misconceptions about it - resulting in numerous missed opportunities.
This presentation will clarify what OSS is (and isn&#8217;t),
rebut common misunderstandings about OSS, discuss the relationship
of OSS and security, discuss how to find and evaluate OSS,
and explain OSS licensing (including how to
combine products and select a license).
It will show why nearly all extant OSS is COTS software, and
thus why it&#8217;s illegal (as well as foolish) to ignore OSS options.&#8221;

This presentation is hosted by the
