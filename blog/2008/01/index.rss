I&amp;#8217;m going to present a webinar on
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dwheeler.com/oss-dod-webinar2008.html&quot;&gt;
&amp;#8220;Open Source Software (OSS) and the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD)&amp;#8221;
&lt;/a&gt;
on Feb 11, 2008, 3:00-4:30pm EST.
It is open to the public, at no charge.
To find out how to sign up, see
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dwheeler.com/oss-dod-webinar2008.html&quot;&gt;
http://www.dwheeler.com/oss-dod-webinar2008.html&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Here&amp;#8217;s the summary:
&amp;#8220;Open source software (OSS) has become widespread, but there are many
misconceptions about it - resulting in numerous missed opportunities.
This presentation will clarify what OSS is (and isn&amp;#8217;t),
rebut common misunderstandings about OSS, discuss the relationship
of OSS and security, discuss how to find and evaluate OSS,
and explain OSS licensing (including how to
combine products and select a license).
It will show why nearly all extant OSS is COTS software, and
thus why it&amp;#8217;s illegal (as well as foolish) to ignore OSS options.&amp;#8221;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
This presentation is hosted by the
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thedacs.com/&quot;&gt;Data &amp;amp; Analysis Center for Software
(DACS)&lt;/a&gt;, which
is technically managed by the
Air Force Research Laboratory - Information Directorate (AFRL/IF). 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Please sign up quickly, if you&amp;#8217;re interested.
There were 45 registrants in the first half hour of its announcement.
&lt;/p&gt;
