The Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) has
just released an interesting new report titled
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.csis.org/media/csis/pubs/081208_securingcyberspace_44.pdf&quot;&gt;
&amp;#8220;Securing Cyberspace for the 44th Presidency:
A Report of the CSIS Commission on Cybersecurity for the 44th Presidency&amp;#8221;&lt;/a&gt;.
The project was co-chaired by Representative James R. Langevin,
Representative Michael T. McCaul, Scott Charney, and
Lt. General Harry Raduege, USAF (Ret).
If you&amp;#8217;re interested in getting our computer infrastructure
more secure, I think this is worth looking at.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The three major findings were:
(1) cybersecurity is now a major national security
problem for the United States,
(2) decisions and actions must respect privacy and
civil liberties, and
(3) only a comprehensive national secuirty strategy
that embraces both the domestic and international
aspects of cybersecurity will make us more secure.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Among their recommendations, they suggest
&amp;#8220;Regulate cyberspace.  Voluntary action is not enough.
The U.S. must &amp;#8230; set minimum standards in order to
ensure that the delivery of critical services in
cyberspace continues if the U.S. is attacked&amp;#8230;
[avoid] prescriptive mandates [and] overreliance on
market forces, which are ill-equipped to meet national
security and public safety requirements&amp;#8221;.
I agree that market forces, without any help, aren&amp;#8217;t
well-equipped to deliver security, but the challenge
is in the details&amp;#8230; it&amp;#8217;s difficult to strike that
balance well.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
They recommend conducting research and development for cybersecurity -
I&amp;#8217;m glad they do, that&amp;#8217;s vitally important.
(I just saw the video
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lLDNosedHk&quot;&gt;The Science of
Victory&lt;/a&gt;, which briefly discusses the importance of research to U.S.
national defense.)
CSIS also recommends &lt;b&gt;not&lt;/b&gt; starting over -
instead, they recommend building on and refining the
existing &amp;#8220;Comprehensive National Cybersecurity Initiative&amp;#8221;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In any case, computers and computer networks are no
longer interesting toys, they are vital services.
We need to improve how we protect them.
&lt;/p&gt;
