<p>
The
<a href="http://www.ftc.gov/opa/2008/11/ipmarketplace.shtm">U.S.
Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has announced the first of a possible series
of public hearings to &#8220;explore the evolving market for intellectual
property (IP)&#8221;</a>. They&#8217;ll begin December 5, 2008, in Washington, DC.
</p>

<p>
Please let the FTC know that the U.S. should
<a href="http://www.dwheeler.com/essays/software-patents.html"><b>eliminate software patents!</b></a>
The U.S. courts made the mistake of rewriting the laws to permit
software patents and business method patents, resulting in a
stifling of both competition and innovation.
Certainly, software patents have been harming
<a href="http://www.dwheeler.com/oss_fs_why.html">free/libre/open-source software (FLOSS)</a>, but they&#8217;ve
been harmful to proprietary software development too.
The
<a href="http://www.ftc.gov/bc/workshops/ipmarketplace/">
U.S. government is asking for comments</a> - so please let them know about
the problems software patents cause, so that we can get rid of them!
</p>

<p>
To help, I&#8217;ve posted a web page titled
<a href="http://www.dwheeler.com/essays/software-patents.html">Eliminate Software Patents!</a>.
This page points to many existing
papers and organizations that explain <i>why</i> software patents should
be eliminated.
And it also lists some ways that, if they can&#8217;t
eliminate the mistake, to at least reduce the damage of the mistake.
</p>

<p>
I think such comments would be very much in line with their series.
They state that
&#8220;The patent system has experienced significant change since the
<a href="http://www.ftc.gov/os/2003/10/innovationrpt.pdf">FTC
released its first IP Report in October 2003</a>,
and more changes are under consideration&#8230;
[changes include] decisions
on injunctive relief, patentability, and licensing issues&#8230; [and]
there is new learning regarding the operation of the patent
system and its contribution to innovation and competition.&#8221;
Even the FTC&#8217;s original 2003 report noted how many people were opposed
to software patents.
</p>

<p>
Please contact the FTC, and let them know that software patents should
be eliminated&#8230;
and feel free to use any of these resources if you do contact them.
