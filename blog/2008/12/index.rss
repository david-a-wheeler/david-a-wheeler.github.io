&lt;p&gt;
The Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) has
just released an interesting new report titled
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.csis.org/media/csis/pubs/081208_securingcyberspace_44.pdf&quot;&gt;
&amp;#8220;Securing Cyberspace for the 44th Presidency:
A Report of the CSIS Commission on Cybersecurity for the 44th Presidency&amp;#8221;&lt;/a&gt;.
The project was co-chaired by Representative James R. Langevin,
Representative Michael T. McCaul, Scott Charney, and
Lt. General Harry Raduege, USAF (Ret).
If you&amp;#8217;re interested in getting our computer infrastructure
more secure, I think this is worth looking at.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The three major findings were:
(1) cybersecurity is now a major national security
problem for the United States,
(2) decisions and actions must respect privacy and
civil liberties, and
(3) only a comprehensive national secuirty strategy
that embraces both the domestic and international
aspects of cybersecurity will make us more secure.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Among their recommendations, they suggest
&amp;#8220;Regulate cyberspace.  Voluntary action is not enough.
The U.S. must &amp;#8230; set minimum standards in order to
ensure that the delivery of critical services in
cyberspace continues if the U.S. is attacked&amp;#8230;
[avoid] prescriptive mandates [and] overreliance on
market forces, which are ill-equipped to meet national
security and public safety requirements&amp;#8221;.
I agree that market forces, without any help, aren&amp;#8217;t
well-equipped to deliver security, but the challenge
is in the details&amp;#8230; it&amp;#8217;s difficult to strike that
balance well.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
They recommend conducting research and development for cybersecurity -
I&amp;#8217;m glad they do, that&amp;#8217;s vitally important.
(I just saw the video
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lLDNosedHk&quot;&gt;The Science of
Victory&lt;/a&gt;, which briefly discusses the importance of research to U.S.
national defense.)
CSIS also recommends &lt;b&gt;not&lt;/b&gt; starting over -
instead, they recommend building on and refining the
existing &amp;#8220;Comprehensive National Cybersecurity Initiative&amp;#8221;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In any case, computers and computer networks are no
longer interesting toys, they are vital services.
We need to improve how we protect them.
&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Use &amp;#8220;FLOSS&amp;#8221; instead of &amp;#8220;FOSS&amp;#8221; or &amp;#8220;OSS/FS&amp;#8221; as Universal term for Open Source Software / Free Software</title>

&lt;p&gt;
Below is my brief attempt to untangle some terminology.
In short, I suggest using &amp;#8220;FLOSS&amp;#8221; instead of &amp;#8220;FOSS&amp;#8221; or &amp;#8220;OSS/FS&amp;#8221;
for software which meets the 
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html&quot;&gt;Free Software Definition&lt;/a&gt; and
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.opensource.org/docs/definition.php&quot;&gt;Open Source Definition&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
There are many alternative terms for &amp;#8220;Free software&amp;#8221; in the sense of the
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html&quot;&gt;Free Software Definition&lt;/a&gt;.
Examples of such alternatives are
&amp;#8220;open source software&amp;#8221;, &amp;#8220;libre software&amp;#8221;,
&amp;#8220;FOSS&amp;#8221; or &amp;#8220;F/OSS&amp;#8221; (free/open-source software&amp;#8221;),
OSS/FS (open source software / free software), &amp;#8220;freed software&amp;#8221;, and
&amp;#8220;unfettered software&amp;#8221;.
&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_terms_for_free_software&quot;&gt;
Wikipedia&amp;#8217;s article on alternative terms for free software&lt;/a&gt;
discusses alternative terminology further.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
For someone (like me) who tries to &lt;i&gt;write&lt;/i&gt; about software under
these kinds of licenses, having multiple different names is annoying.
What&amp;#8217;s worse, the term &amp;#8220;Free software&amp;#8221; (the original term) is
really misleading; people who hear that term presume that you mean &amp;#8220;no cost&amp;#8221;,
which is not related to the intended meaning of &amp;#8220;freedom&amp;#8221;.
Yes, I know that the &amp;#8220;Free&amp;#8221; means &amp;#8220;freedom&amp;#8221; (aka &amp;#8220;Free as in speech&amp;#8221; or
&amp;#8220;Free market&amp;#8221;), and I&amp;#8217;m well aware that you can charge
and pay for Free software.
But you have to re-teach
everyone who knows English, &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; you&amp;#8217;re fighting a losing battle
against search engines (which will mix results together
when you search for a phrase with two common meanings).
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/open-source-misses-the-point.html&quot;&gt;Even
the FSF admits that the term &amp;#8220;Free software&amp;#8221; is widely misunderstood&lt;/a&gt;.
Years ago I suggested to Richard Stallman that he use the term
&amp;#8220;freed software&amp;#8221; instead of &amp;#8220;free software&amp;#8221;, so that the term would be
different but the acronyms could stay the same;
obviously he didn&amp;#8217;t accept that suggestion.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The term &amp;#8220;open source software&amp;#8221; is the most widely used term
in English, and the term&amp;#8217;s creators intentionally tried to include
everyone regardless of their motivations.
I&amp;#8217;m happy to use the term &amp;#8220;open source software&amp;#8221;;
I think it&amp;#8217;s a reasonable term and it&amp;#8217;s widely accepted.
So, in groups which already use that term, I&amp;#8217;ll gladly use
&amp;#8220;open source software&amp;#8221; as the &amp;#8220;universal&amp;#8221; term
that covers all such software, regardless of the motivations of the developers.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Unfortunately,
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/open-source-misses-the-point.html&quot;&gt;
many of the developers of such software strongly
object to the term &amp;#8220;open source software&amp;#8221;&lt;/a&gt; as the universal term.
Their objection is that many people who use the term
&amp;#8220;open source software&amp;#8221; only emphasize engineering or business advantages,
while the FSF emphasizes freedom for end-users and objects to a term
that doesn&amp;#8217;t note that possibility somehow.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This objection causes problems for people like me.
I&amp;#8217;m usually &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; trying to exclude those who object to
the term &amp;#8220;open source software&amp;#8221;.
Instead,
I often want an &lt;i&gt;inclusive&lt;/i&gt; term to describe such software, regardless
of the motivations of its developers.
Different developers often have different motivations - and even the
same developer may have different motivations over time or on different
projects.
So, is there some term that most can accept?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
One inclusive term is &amp;#8220;OSS/FS&amp;#8221;, which you can blame me for.
I starting writing about open source software / free software (OSS/FS)
many years ago, when such writings were much less common.
So for example, look at the title of my massive paper
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dwheeler.com/oss_fs_why.html&quot;&gt;&amp;#8220;Why open source software /
free software (OSS/FS)? Look at the Numbers!&amp;#8221;&lt;/a&gt;
At the time, there wasn&amp;#8217;t an obvious &amp;#8220;universal&amp;#8221; term, so I chose to use
&amp;#8220;OSS/FS&amp;#8221;, which was an obvious way to combine the two most common terms.
&amp;#8220;OSS/FS&amp;#8221; takes too long to pronounce, though, so it hasn&amp;#8217;t really caught on.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Among the other terms, &amp;#8220;FLOSS&amp;#8221; (Free/Libre/Open-Source Software)
seems to have won the popularity contest
as a &amp;#8220;universal&amp;#8221; English term that nearly all can accept.
Google reports the approximate number of pages a phrase will return, so
it&amp;#8217;s a reasonable way to determine how popular a phrase is.
A quick search on Google (using English on 2008-12-08) shows these
popularity figures:
&amp;#8220;FLOSS software&amp;#8221; gets 1,570,000 hits,
&amp;#8220;Libre software&amp;#8221; gets 596,000 hits,
&amp;#8220;FOSS software&amp;#8221; gets 595,000 hits,
&amp;#8220;OSS/FS&amp;#8221; gets 193,000 hits, and
&amp;#8220;F/OSS software&amp;#8221; gets 66,200 hits.
Note that FLOSS adds the term &amp;#8220;libre&amp;#8221;; &amp;#8220;libre software&amp;#8221; or &amp;#8220;livre software&amp;#8221;
is widely used as the universal term in Romance
languages, so adding it helps clarify &lt;i&gt;which&lt;/i&gt; sense of &amp;#8220;free&amp;#8221; is meant.
The term &amp;#8220;FLOSS&amp;#8221; also hides the fact that some people prefer the original
spelling &amp;#8220;open source software&amp;#8221;, while others prefer to hyphenate it as
&amp;#8220;open-source software&amp;#8221;.
In context, &amp;#8220;FLOSS&amp;#8221; is unlikely to be confused with dental floss.
If you&amp;#8217;re an advocate who objects to that similarity,
just imagine that &amp;#8220;FLOSS cleans the gunk out&amp;#8221; :-).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So, when speaking to a group that already uses &amp;#8220;open source software&amp;#8221; as
the universal term for such software, I&amp;#8217;ll use &amp;#8220;open source software&amp;#8221;.
I have no objection to &amp;#8220;open source software&amp;#8221; as the universal term;
it&amp;#8217;s a reasonable term, and my primary goal is understanding by my hearers.
I don&amp;#8217;t see a problem with using separate terms to describe people&amp;#8217;s
motivations, as opposed to terms for the software that they (co-)develop.
Thus, I can glibly say &amp;#8220;open source software is co-developed
by people and organizations who often have different motivations to do so;
those who develop it to promote freedom for end-users typically
term their members the &amp;#8216;Free Software Movement&amp;#8217;,
and those who develop it for engineering and business (cost-saving)
reasons may be referred to as the &amp;#8216;Open Source Movement&amp;#8217;&amp;#8221;.
I think that&amp;#8217;s perfectly acceptable as terminology; it&amp;#8217;s certainly
clear that different people and organizations can have different motivations
and yet can work together.
Many, many people use &amp;#8220;open source software&amp;#8221; as the universal term
for such software.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
But not all groups accept the term &amp;#8220;open source software&amp;#8221; as the
universal term for such software, and my writings on my website
cater to a variety of people.
You can&amp;#8217;t please everyone, but I&amp;#8217;d like to avoid unnecessarily
alienating people.
At the least, I&amp;#8217;d rather people object to the substance of my writing
instead of my word choice :-).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So:
&lt;b&gt;I suggest using &lt;i&gt;&amp;#8220;FLOSS&amp;#8221;&lt;/i&gt; (Free/Libre/Open-source software)
instead of &amp;#8220;FOSS&amp;#8221; or &amp;#8220;F/OSS&amp;#8221; or &amp;#8220;OSS/FS&amp;#8221;&lt;/b&gt;
as the universal term for such software (in English).
It&amp;#8217;s easy to say, inclusive, and it seems to be the most popular of
those alternatives.
Many people use &amp;#8220;open source software&amp;#8221; or &amp;#8220;Free software&amp;#8221;
(with the funny capitalization)
as the universal term for such software, and that&amp;#8217;s fine by me.
But for material on my website, I intend to slowly migrate towards FLOSS
instead of my older term OSS/FS.
I&amp;#8217;ll leave OSS/FS in a few places (including titles)
so that people searching for it will
still find it, but at this point, I think the OSS/FS acronym is a fossil.
I&amp;#8217;ll tend to leave &amp;#8220;open source software&amp;#8221; where I use that term; typically
those are written for audiences where it&amp;#8217;s established practice to
use that term.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Strictly speaking, &amp;#8220;Free software&amp;#8221; in the FSF sense is defined by the
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html&quot;&gt;Free Software Definition (FSD)&lt;/a&gt;,
and &amp;#8220;open source software&amp;#8221; is defined by the
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.opensource.org/docs/definition.php&quot;&gt;Open Source Definition (OSD)&lt;/a&gt;.
In practice, a software license will typically either meet, or fail
to meet, both definitions.
This is hardly surprising; different dictionaries have different descriptions
of much simpler words.
The &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html&quot;&gt;Free Software Definition&lt;/a&gt;
is &lt;b&gt;much&lt;/b&gt; simpler and easier to understand, and it gives a better
understanding of &lt;i&gt;why&lt;/i&gt; an end-user might want such a license.
So when describing what FLOSS is, I generally prefer to use the
simpler and clearer Free Software Definition.
If I&amp;#8217;m doing a technical analysis of a software license, I
require that &lt;i&gt;both&lt;/i&gt; definitions be met.
The FSD is better at explaining the overall concept, but the OSD 
has additional information that helps clarify it.
In other words, a software license must meet
&lt;i&gt;both&lt;/i&gt; definitions, or it&amp;#8217;s not a FLOSS license.
&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Tell the FTC: Eliminate software patents</title>
    <link>http://www.dwheeler.com/blog/2008/12/01#ftc-software-patent</link>
    <pubDate>Mon, 01 Dec 2008 17:27 GMT</pubDate>
    <!-- date: 2008-12-01 -->
    <description>
&lt;p&gt;
The
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ftc.gov/opa/2008/11/ipmarketplace.shtm&quot;&gt;U.S.
Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has announced the first of a possible series
of public hearings to &amp;#8220;explore the evolving market for intellectual
property (IP)&amp;#8221;&lt;/a&gt;. They&amp;#8217;ll begin December 5, 2008, in Washington, DC.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Please let the FTC know that the U.S. should
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dwheeler.com/essays/software-patents.html&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;eliminate software patents!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
The U.S. courts made the mistake of rewriting the laws to permit
software patents and business method patents, resulting in a
stifling of both competition and innovation.
Certainly, software patents have been harming
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dwheeler.com/oss_fs_why.html&quot;&gt;free/libre/open-source software (FLOSS)&lt;/a&gt;, but they&amp;#8217;ve
been harmful to proprietary software development too.
The
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ftc.gov/bc/workshops/ipmarketplace/&quot;&gt;
U.S. government is asking for comments&lt;/a&gt; - so please let them know about
the problems software patents cause, so that we can get rid of them!
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
To help, I&amp;#8217;ve posted a web page titled
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dwheeler.com/essays/software-patents.html&quot;&gt;Eliminate Software Patents!&lt;/a&gt;.
This page points to many existing
papers and organizations that explain &lt;i&gt;why&lt;/i&gt; software patents should
be eliminated.
And it also lists some ways that, if they can&amp;#8217;t
eliminate the mistake, to at least reduce the damage of the mistake.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I think such comments would be very much in line with their series.
They state that
&amp;#8220;The patent system has experienced significant change since the
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ftc.gov/os/2003/10/innovationrpt.pdf&quot;&gt;FTC
released its first IP Report in October 2003&lt;/a&gt;,
and more changes are under consideration&amp;#8230;
[changes include] decisions
on injunctive relief, patentability, and licensing issues&amp;#8230; [and]
there is new learning regarding the operation of the patent
system and its contribution to innovation and competition.&amp;#8221;
Even the FTC&amp;#8217;s original 2003 report noted how many people were opposed
to software patents.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Please contact the FTC, and let them know that software patents should
be eliminated&amp;#8230;
and feel free to use any of these resources if you do contact them.
&lt;/p&gt;
