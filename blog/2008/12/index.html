<p><a name="csis-2008"><font size="+2"><b>CSIS Cybersecurity Report</b></font></a></p><p></p>
<p>
The Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) has
just released an interesting new report titled
<a href="http://www.csis.org/media/csis/pubs/081208_securingcyberspace_44.pdf">
&#8220;Securing Cyberspace for the 44th Presidency:
A Report of the CSIS Commission on Cybersecurity for the 44th Presidency&#8221;</a>.
The project was co-chaired by Representative James R. Langevin,
Representative Michael T. McCaul, Scott Charney, and
Lt. General Harry Raduege, USAF (Ret).
If you&#8217;re interested in getting our computer infrastructure
more secure, I think this is worth looking at.
</p>
<p>
The three major findings were:
(1) cybersecurity is now a major national security
problem for the United States,
(2) decisions and actions must respect privacy and
civil liberties, and
(3) only a comprehensive national secuirty strategy
that embraces both the domestic and international
aspects of cybersecurity will make us more secure.
</p>
<p>
Among their recommendations, they suggest
&#8220;Regulate cyberspace.  Voluntary action is not enough.
The U.S. must &#8230; set minimum standards in order to
ensure that the delivery of critical services in
cyberspace continues if the U.S. is attacked&#8230;
[avoid] prescriptive mandates [and] overreliance on
market forces, which are ill-equipped to meet national
security and public safety requirements&#8221;.
I agree that market forces, without any help, aren&#8217;t
well-equipped to deliver security, but the challenge
is in the details&#8230; it&#8217;s difficult to strike that
balance well.
</p>
<p>
They recommend conducting research and development for cybersecurity -
I&#8217;m glad they do, that&#8217;s vitally important.
(I just saw the video
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lLDNosedHk">The Science of
Victory</a>, which briefly discusses the importance of research to U.S.
national defense.)
CSIS also recommends <b>not</b> starting over -
instead, they recommend building on and refining the
existing &#8220;Comprehensive National Cybersecurity Initiative&#8221;.
</p>
<p>
In any case, computers and computer networks are no
longer interesting toys, they are vital services.
We need to improve how we protect them.

<h1>Mon, 08 Dec 2008</h1>
<p><a name="use-floss-not-foss-ossfs"><font size="+2"><b>Use &#8220;FLOSS&#8221; instead of &#8220;FOSS&#8221; or &#8220;OSS/FS&#8221; as Universal term for Open Source Software / Free Software</b></font></a></p><p></p>
<p>
Below is my brief attempt to untangle some terminology.
In short, I suggest using &#8220;FLOSS&#8221; instead of &#8220;FOSS&#8221; or &#8220;OSS/FS&#8221;
for software which meets the 
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html">Free Software Definition</a> and
<a href="http://www.opensource.org/docs/definition.php">Open Source Definition</a>.
</p>
<p>
There are many alternative terms for &#8220;Free software&#8221; in the sense of the
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html">Free Software Definition</a>.
Examples of such alternatives are
&#8220;open source software&#8221;, &#8220;libre software&#8221;,
&#8220;FOSS&#8221; or &#8220;F/OSS&#8221; (free/open-source software&#8221;),
OSS/FS (open source software / free software), &#8220;freed software&#8221;, and
&#8220;unfettered software&#8221;.
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_terms_for_free_software">
Wikipedia&#8217;s article on alternative terms for free software</a>
discusses alternative terminology further.
</p>
<p>
For someone (like me) who tries to <i>write</i> about software under
these kinds of licenses, having multiple different names is annoying.
What&#8217;s worse, the term &#8220;Free software&#8221; (the original term) is
really misleading; people who hear that term presume that you mean &#8220;no cost&#8221;,
which is not related to the intended meaning of &#8220;freedom&#8221;.
Yes, I know that the &#8220;Free&#8221; means &#8220;freedom&#8221; (aka &#8220;Free as in speech&#8221; or
&#8220;Free market&#8221;), and I&#8217;m well aware that you can charge
and pay for Free software.
But you have to re-teach
everyone who knows English, <i>and</i> you&#8217;re fighting a losing battle
against search engines (which will mix results together
when you search for a phrase with two common meanings).
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/open-source-misses-the-point.html">Even
the FSF admits that the term &#8220;Free software&#8221; is widely misunderstood</a>.
Years ago I suggested to Richard Stallman that he use the term
&#8220;freed software&#8221; instead of &#8220;free software&#8221;, so that the term would be
different but the acronyms could stay the same;
obviously he didn&#8217;t accept that suggestion.
</p>
<p>
The term &#8220;open source software&#8221; is the most widely used term
in English, and the term&#8217;s creators intentionally tried to include
everyone regardless of their motivations.
I&#8217;m happy to use the term &#8220;open source software&#8221;;
I think it&#8217;s a reasonable term and it&#8217;s widely accepted.
So, in groups which already use that term, I&#8217;ll gladly use
&#8220;open source software&#8221; as the &#8220;universal&#8221; term
that covers all such software, regardless of the motivations of the developers.
</p>
<p>
Unfortunately,
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/open-source-misses-the-point.html">
many of the developers of such software strongly
object to the term &#8220;open source software&#8221;</a> as the universal term.
Their objection is that many people who use the term
&#8220;open source software&#8221; only emphasize engineering or business advantages,
while the FSF emphasizes freedom for end-users and objects to a term
that doesn&#8217;t note that possibility somehow.
</p>
<p>
This objection causes problems for people like me.
I&#8217;m usually <i>not</i> trying to exclude those who object to
the term &#8220;open source software&#8221;.
Instead,
I often want an <i>inclusive</i> term to describe such software, regardless
of the motivations of its developers.
Different developers often have different motivations - and even the
same developer may have different motivations over time or on different
projects.
So, is there some term that most can accept?
</p>
<p>
One inclusive term is &#8220;OSS/FS&#8221;, which you can blame me for.
I starting writing about open source software / free software (OSS/FS)
many years ago, when such writings were much less common.
So for example, look at the title of my massive paper
<a href="http://www.dwheeler.com/oss_fs_why.html">&#8220;Why open source software /
free software (OSS/FS)? Look at the Numbers!&#8221;</a>
At the time, there wasn&#8217;t an obvious &#8220;universal&#8221; term, so I chose to use
&#8220;OSS/FS&#8221;, which was an obvious way to combine the two most common terms.
&#8220;OSS/FS&#8221; takes too long to pronounce, though, so it hasn&#8217;t really caught on.
</p>
<p>
Among the other terms, &#8220;FLOSS&#8221; (Free/Libre/Open-Source Software)
seems to have won the popularity contest
as a &#8220;universal&#8221; English term that nearly all can accept.
Google reports the approximate number of pages a phrase will return, so
it&#8217;s a reasonable way to determine how popular a phrase is.
A quick search on Google (using English on 2008-12-08) shows these
popularity figures:
&#8220;FLOSS software&#8221; gets 1,570,000 hits,
&#8220;Libre software&#8221; gets 596,000 hits,
&#8220;FOSS software&#8221; gets 595,000 hits,
&#8220;OSS/FS&#8221; gets 193,000 hits, and
&#8220;F/OSS software&#8221; gets 66,200 hits.
Note that FLOSS adds the term &#8220;libre&#8221;; &#8220;libre software&#8221; or &#8220;livre software&#8221;
is widely used as the universal term in Romance
languages, so adding it helps clarify <i>which</i> sense of &#8220;free&#8221; is meant.
The term &#8220;FLOSS&#8221; also hides the fact that some people prefer the original
spelling &#8220;open source software&#8221;, while others prefer to hyphenate it as
&#8220;open-source software&#8221;.
In context, &#8220;FLOSS&#8221; is unlikely to be confused with dental floss.
If you&#8217;re an advocate who objects to that similarity,
just imagine that &#8220;FLOSS cleans the gunk out&#8221; :-).
</p>
<p>
So, when speaking to a group that already uses &#8220;open source software&#8221; as
the universal term for such software, I&#8217;ll use &#8220;open source software&#8221;.
I have no objection to &#8220;open source software&#8221; as the universal term;
it&#8217;s a reasonable term, and my primary goal is understanding by my hearers.
I don&#8217;t see a problem with using separate terms to describe people&#8217;s
motivations, as opposed to terms for the software that they (co-)develop.
Thus, I can glibly say &#8220;open source software is co-developed
by people and organizations who often have different motivations to do so;
those who develop it to promote freedom for end-users typically
term their members the &#8216;Free Software Movement&#8217;,
and those who develop it for engineering and business (cost-saving)
reasons may be referred to as the &#8216;Open Source Movement&#8217;&#8221;.
I think that&#8217;s perfectly acceptable as terminology; it&#8217;s certainly
clear that different people and organizations can have different motivations
and yet can work together.
Many, many people use &#8220;open source software&#8221; as the universal term
for such software.
</p>
<p>
But not all groups accept the term &#8220;open source software&#8221; as the
universal term for such software, and my writings on my website
cater to a variety of people.
You can&#8217;t please everyone, but I&#8217;d like to avoid unnecessarily
alienating people.
At the least, I&#8217;d rather people object to the substance of my writing
instead of my word choice :-).
</p>
<p>
So:
<b>I suggest using <i>&#8220;FLOSS&#8221;</i> (Free/Libre/Open-source software)
instead of &#8220;FOSS&#8221; or &#8220;F/OSS&#8221; or &#8220;OSS/FS&#8221;</b>
as the universal term for such software (in English).
It&#8217;s easy to say, inclusive, and it seems to be the most popular of
those alternatives.
Many people use &#8220;open source software&#8221; or &#8220;Free software&#8221;
(with the funny capitalization)
as the universal term for such software, and that&#8217;s fine by me.
But for material on my website, I intend to slowly migrate towards FLOSS
instead of my older term OSS/FS.
I&#8217;ll leave OSS/FS in a few places (including titles)
so that people searching for it will
still find it, but at this point, I think the OSS/FS acronym is a fossil.
I&#8217;ll tend to leave &#8220;open source software&#8221; where I use that term; typically
those are written for audiences where it&#8217;s established practice to
use that term.
</p>
<p>
Strictly speaking, &#8220;Free software&#8221; in the FSF sense is defined by the
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html">Free Software Definition (FSD)</a>,
and &#8220;open source software&#8221; is defined by the
<a href="http://www.opensource.org/docs/definition.php">Open Source Definition (OSD)</a>.
In practice, a software license will typically either meet, or fail
to meet, both definitions.
This is hardly surprising; different dictionaries have different descriptions
of much simpler words.
The <a href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html">Free Software Definition</a>
is <b>much</b> simpler and easier to understand, and it gives a better
understanding of <i>why</i> an end-user might want such a license.
So when describing what FLOSS is, I generally prefer to use the
simpler and clearer Free Software Definition.
If I&#8217;m doing a technical analysis of a software license, I
require that <i>both</i> definitions be met.
The FSD is better at explaining the overall concept, but the OSD 
has additional information that helps clarify it.
In other words, a software license must meet
<i>both</i> definitions, or it&#8217;s not a FLOSS license.

<h1>Mon, 01 Dec 2008</h1>
<p><a name="ftc-software-patent"><font size="+2"><b>Tell the FTC: Eliminate software patents</b></font></a></p><p></p>
<p>
The
<a href="http://www.ftc.gov/opa/2008/11/ipmarketplace.shtm">U.S.
Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has announced the first of a possible series
of public hearings to &#8220;explore the evolving market for intellectual
property (IP)&#8221;</a>. They&#8217;ll begin December 5, 2008, in Washington, DC.
</p>

<p>
Please let the FTC know that the U.S. should
<a href="http://www.dwheeler.com/essays/software-patents.html"><b>eliminate software patents!</b></a>
The U.S. courts made the mistake of rewriting the laws to permit
software patents and business method patents, resulting in a
stifling of both competition and innovation.
Certainly, software patents have been harming
<a href="http://www.dwheeler.com/oss_fs_why.html">free/libre/open-source software (FLOSS)</a>, but they&#8217;ve
been harmful to proprietary software development too.
The
<a href="http://www.ftc.gov/bc/workshops/ipmarketplace/">
U.S. government is asking for comments</a> - so please let them know about
the problems software patents cause, so that we can get rid of them!
</p>

<p>
To help, I&#8217;ve posted a web page titled
<a href="http://www.dwheeler.com/essays/software-patents.html">Eliminate Software Patents!</a>.
This page points to many existing
papers and organizations that explain <i>why</i> software patents should
be eliminated.
And it also lists some ways that, if they can&#8217;t
eliminate the mistake, to at least reduce the damage of the mistake.
</p>

<p>
I think such comments would be very much in line with their series.
They state that
&#8220;The patent system has experienced significant change since the
<a href="http://www.ftc.gov/os/2003/10/innovationrpt.pdf">FTC
released its first IP Report in October 2003</a>,
and more changes are under consideration&#8230;
[changes include] decisions
on injunctive relief, patentability, and licensing issues&#8230; [and]
there is new learning regarding the operation of the patent
system and its contribution to innovation and competition.&#8221;
Even the FTC&#8217;s original 2003 report noted how many people were opposed
to software patents.
</p>

<p>
Please contact the FTC, and let them know that software patents should
be eliminated&#8230;
and feel free to use any of these resources if you do contact them.
