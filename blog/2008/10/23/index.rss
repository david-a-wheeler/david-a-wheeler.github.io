In my post
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dwheeler.com/blog/2008/10/22/#development-cost-linux-2008&quot;&gt;
Estimating the Total Development Cost of a Linux Distribution&lt;/a&gt;,
I noted that one of Fedora 9&amp;#8217;s largest components was
Enterprise Security Client (ESC), and wondered why
ESC would be so big.
After all, a security client should be small - not large.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I just got the answer from Rahul Sundaram of the Fedora project,
who asked internally.
It turns out that ESC currently includes its own copy of
&lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en/XULRunner&quot;&gt;XULRunner&lt;/a&gt;.
XULRunner essentially provides a library and infrastructure for running
&amp;#8220;XUL+XPCOM&amp;#8221; applications such as Firefox, Thunderbird, and ESC.
You can
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.redhat.com/docs/manuals/cert-system/7.3/html/Enterprise_Security_Client_Guide/Enterprise_Security_Client_Configuration-Enterprise_Security_Client_File_Locations.html&quot;&gt;confirm this using the on-line ESC documentation&lt;/a&gt;.
This is clearly not optimal; as I noted in a previous blog entry,
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dwheeler.com/blog/2008/09/19/#use-system-libraries&quot;&gt;
developers should use system libraries, and not create their own local
copies&lt;/a&gt;.
Rahul says that the
&amp;#8220;the developers are currently working on making it use the system
copy[,] which should drop down the size considerably&amp;#8221;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So ESC isn&amp;#8217;t really that big - it&amp;#8217;s just that ESC creates its own
local copy of a massive infrastructure.
This is obviously not great for security,
since there&amp;#8217;s a higher risk that bugs fixed in the real XULRunner
would not be fixed in ESC&amp;#8217;s local copy.
But this appears to be a temporary issue; once Fedora&amp;#8217;s version of
ESC switches to the system XULRunner, the problem will disappear.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
By the way, if you&amp;#8217;re interested in the whole &amp;#8220;measuring Linux&amp;#8217;s size&amp;#8221; thing,
you should definitely take a look at the past measurements of Debian.
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dwheeler.com/sloc/&quot;&gt;My page on counting Source
Lines of Code (SLOC)&lt;/a&gt; includes links and summaries of that work.
It&amp;#8217;s neat stuff!
My thanks to
Jesús M. González-Barahona, Miguel A. Ortuño Pérez, Pedro de las Heras Quirós,
José Centeno González, Vicente Matellán Olivera,
Juan-José Amor-Iglesias, Gregorio Robles-Martínez, and Israel Herráiz-Tabernero
for doing that.
