Sadly, attackers have been exploiting the
COVID-19 pandemic (caused by Coronavirus SARS-CoV-2) to
cause problems via computers around the world.
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.modernhealthcare.com/cybersecurity/hackers-taking-advantage-covid-19-spread-malware&quot;&gt;Modern Healthcare&lt;/a&gt; notes that
hospitals are seeing active attacks,
emails where a sender (pretending to be from the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) asks the receiver
to open a link (which is actually malware),
other scams claim to track COVID-19 cases but actually steals personal
information.
&lt;a href=&quot;https://threatpost.com/official-government-covid-19-apps-threats/154512/&quot;
&gt;Many official government COVID-19 mobile applications have
threats&lt;/a&gt; (ranging from malware to incredibly basic security
problems).
For example, in Columbia the government released
a mobile app called CoronApp-Colombia to help people track potential
COVID-19 symptoms; the intention is great, but as of March 25 it failed
to use HTTPS (secure communication), and instead used HTTP
(insecure) to relay personal data (including health data).
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
In the long term, the solution is for software developers and operators
to do a much better job in creating and deploying secure applications.
In the short term,
&lt;a href=&quot;https://hbr.org/2020/03/will-coronavirus-lead-to-more-cyber-attacks&quot;
&gt;we need to take extra care about our computer security&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
On April 1, 2020, I started working at the Linux Foundation!
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
My new title is &amp;#8220;Director, Open Source Supply Chain Security&amp;#8221;.
I&amp;#8217;ll be working to improve the security of open source software.
I look forward to working with many others on this important problem.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
So please wish me luck&amp;#8230; and stay tuned for more.
&lt;/p&gt;
