&lt;p&gt;
If you develop software, please consider taking the &lt;i&gt;free&lt;/i&gt;
trio of courses
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.edx.org/professional-certificate/linuxfoundationx-secure-software-development-fundamentals&quot;
&gt;Secure Software Development Fundamentals&lt;/a&gt;
on edX that I recently created for the Linux Foundation&amp;#8217;s
&lt;a href=&quot;https://openssf.org/&quot;
&gt;Open Source Security Foundation (OpenSSF)&lt;/a&gt;.
The trio of courses is free; if you want to get a certificate to prove
you learned it, you can pay to take some tests to earn the certificate
(this is how many edX courses work).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Here&amp;#8217;s a brief summary:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Almost all software is under attack today, and many organizations are unprepared in their defense. This professional certificate program, developed by the Open Source Security Foundation (OpenSSF), a project of the Linux Foundation, is geared towards software developers, DevOps professionals, software engineers, web application developers, and others interested in learning how to develop secure software, focusing on practical steps that can be taken, even with limited resources to improve information security. The program enables software developers to create and maintain systems that are much harder to successfully attack, reduce the damage when attacks are successful, and speed the response so that any latent vulnerabilities can be rapidly repaired. The best practices covered in the course apply to all software developers, and it includes information especially useful to those who use or develop open source software.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The program discusses risks and requirements, design principles, and evaluating code (such as packages) for reuse. It then focuses on key implementation issues: input validation (such as why allowlists and not denylists should be used), processing data securely, calling out to other programs, sending output, cryptography, error handling, and incident response. This is followed by a discussion on various kinds of verification issues, including tests, including security testing and penetration testing, and security tools. It ends with a discussion on deployment and handling vulnerability reports.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The training courses included in this program focus on practical steps that you (as a developer) can take to counter most common kinds of attacks. It does not focus on how to attack systems, how attacks work, or longer-term research.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Modern software development depends on open source software, with open source now being pervasive in data centers, consumer devices, and services. It is important that those responsible for cybersecurity are able to understand and verify the security of the open source chain of contributors and dependencies. Thanks to the involvement of OpenSFF, a cross-industry collaboration that brings together leaders to improve the security of open source software by building a broader community, targeted initiatives, and best practices, this program provides specific tips on how to use and develop open source secur
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I also teach a graduate course on how to the design and implementation
of secure software.
As you might expect, a graduate course isn&amp;#8217;t the same thing.
But please, if you&amp;#8217;re a software developer, take the free edX, my class,
or in some other way learn about how to develop secure software.
The software that society depends on needs to be more secure
than it is today.
Having software developers know how develop secure software
is a necesary step towards creating that secure software we all need.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
If you contribute to Free/Open Source Software,
please take the
&lt;a href=&quot;https://hbs.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_enfu6tjRM0QzwQB&quot;
&gt;FOSS Contributor Survey&lt;/a&gt;!
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
This survey is a collaboration between the Linux Foundation&amp;#8217;s Core
Infrastructure Initiative and the Laboratory for Innovation Science
at Harvard. Some of the questions are specific to those who write
software; if you contribute, but don&amp;#8217;t write software, just skip
those questions.
The goal is to get a better understanding about its development so that
we can best work out how to improve its security and sustainability.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Also: please tell others who develop this software about the survey!
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
One interesting complication about this survey is that it&amp;#8217;s difficult to
get the word out about such a general survey.
People talk about the &amp;#8220;open source software community&amp;#8221;, but in practice
there isn&amp;#8217;t &lt;i&gt;one&lt;/i&gt; such community, there are many communities
with some overlap.
I don&amp;#8217;t want to spam people who have never expressed any interest
in information like this.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I&amp;#8217;m currently talking with some folks in the Linux Foundatinon leadership
about sending a one-time email &lt;i&gt;only&lt;/i&gt; to developers who are
&lt;i&gt;already&lt;/i&gt; signed up for Linux Foundation mailing lists
that are focused on developing open source software.
We don&amp;#8217;t want to spam people, but I think it&amp;#8217;s reasonable to believe
that people on those mailing lists &lt;i&gt;are&lt;/i&gt; interestd in information
related to the development of open source software.
One problem with sending to multiple mailing lists is that we don&amp;#8217;t want
to annoy people by having them receive multiple copies, so we want
to work out a way so an individual only gets one copy.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I&amp;#8217;ve never done this before, and I hate spam myself.
So I&amp;#8217;m &lt;i&gt;first&lt;/i&gt; checking with Linux Foundation leaders and program
managers to see if they think this is reasonable.
I think it is, but it&amp;#8217;s easy to justify anything to yourself, so
I&amp;#8217;m waiting to hear from others about what they think.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
So getting back to the point -
if you contribute to Free/Open Source Software,
please take the
&lt;a href=&quot;https://hbs.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_enfu6tjRM0QzwQB&quot;
&gt;FOSS Contributor Survey&lt;/a&gt;!

    <title>Verizon still failing to support RPKI</title>
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"></meta>

    <description>
&lt;p&gt;
On 2019-06-24 parts of the Internet became inaccessible because
Verizon failed to implement a key security measure called
&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.cloudflare.com/rpki/&quot;
&gt;Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI)&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.cloudflare.com/how-verizon-and-a-bgp-optimizer-knocked-large-parts-of-the-internet-offline-today/&quot;
&gt;Here&amp;#8217;s a brief story about the 2019 failure by Verizon&lt;/a&gt;, with
&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.cloudflare.com/the-deep-dive-into-how-verizon-and-a-bgp-optimizer-knocked-large-parts-of-the-internet-offline-monday/&quot;
&gt;follow-on details&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
What&amp;#8217;s shocking is that Verizon is &lt;i&gt;still&lt;/i&gt; failing to implement RPKI.
Verizon&amp;#8217;s continuing failure continues to make it trivial
for both accidents and
malicious actors (including governments) to shut down large swathes of
the Internet, including networks around the US capital.
That&amp;#8217;s especially absurd because during the
COVID-19 pandemic we have become &lt;i&gt;more&lt;/i&gt; dependent on the Internet.
There have been many routine failures by accident or on purpose;
it&amp;#8217;s past time to deploy the basic countermeasure (RPKI) to deal with it.
Verizon needs to implement RPKI, as many other operators already have.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The fundamental problem is that the Internet depends on a routing system
called Border Gateway Protocol (BGP), which never included a
(useful) security mechanism.
&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.cloudflare.com/rpki/&quot;&gt;Resource Public Key (RPKI)&lt;/a&gt;
provides an important security mechanism to counter certain kinds of
BGP problems (either by accident or on purpose).
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9vbbxr-GbI&quot;
&gt;&amp;#8220;Why it&amp;#8217;s time to deploy RPKI&amp;#8221; (RIPE NCC, 2019-05-17)&lt;/a&gt;
is a short 2-minute video that explains why it&amp;#8217;s past time to deploy RPKI.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Verizon already knows that they&amp;#8217;re failing to support RPKI; here&amp;#8217;s a
&lt;a href=&quot;https://forums.verizon.com/t5/Fios-Internet/Verizon-FIOS-does-NOT-provide-important-network-security-known/td-p/895575&quot;&gt;complaint
posted on 2020-04-19 7:16AM that Verizon wasn&amp;#8217;t supporting RPKI&lt;/a&gt;.
It&amp;#8217;s clear RPKI is useful;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.thousandeyes.com/visualizing-the-benefits-of-rpki/&quot;
&gt;&amp;#8220;Visualizing the Benefits of RPKI&amp;#8221; by Kemal Sanjta (2019-07-19)&lt;/a&gt;
shows how RPKI really does help.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If you&amp;#8217;re a Verizon customer, you can easily verify Verizon&amp;#8217;s status via
&lt;a href=&quot;https://isbgpsafeyet.com/&quot;
&gt;Is BGP safe yet?&lt;/a&gt;.
The answer for Verizon users is &amp;#8220;no&amp;#8221;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If your Internet Service Provider (ISP) doesn&amp;#8217;t support RPKI, please
nag them to do so.
If you&amp;#8217;re a government, and your ISPs won&amp;#8217;t yet support RPKI,
ask when they&amp;#8217;re going secure their network with this basic security measure.
It will take work, and it won&amp;#8217;t solve all problems in the universe,
but those are merely excuses for failure; those statements describe
all things that should be done.
RPKI is an important minimum part of securing the Internet, and it&amp;#8217;s time
to ensure that every Internet Service Provider (ISP) supports it.
&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) work at NTIA</title>

&lt;p&gt;
Modern software systems contain many components, which themselves
contain components, which themselves contain components.
Which raises some important questions, for example,
when a vulnerability is publicly identified, how do you know if
your system is affected?
Another issue involves licensing - how can you be confident that
you are meeting all your legal obligations?
This is getting harder to do as systems get bigger, and also because
software development is a global activity.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
On July 19, 2018, the US National Telecommunications and Information
Administration (NTIA) &amp;#8220;convened a meeting of stakeholders from across
multiple sectors to begin a discussion about software transparency and
the proposal being considered for a common structure for describing the
software components in a product containing software.&amp;#8221;
[&lt;i&gt;Framing Software Component Transparency: Establishing a Common Software
Bill of Material (SBOM)&lt;/i&gt;]
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
A key part of this is to make it much easier to define and exchange a
&amp;#8220;Software Bill of Materials&amp;#8221; (SBOM).
You can see a lot of their information at the
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ntia.gov/sbom&quot;&gt;Community-Drafted
Documents on Software Bill of Materials&lt;/a&gt;.
If you&amp;#8217;re interested in this topic, that&amp;#8217;s a decent place to start.

    <title>Initial Analysis of Underhanded Source Code</title>
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"></meta>

&lt;p&gt;
Announcing - a newly-available security paper I wrote! It&amp;#8217;s titled
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ida.org/-/media/feature/publications/i/in/initial-analysis-of-underhanded-source-code/d-13166.ashx&quot;
&gt;&amp;#8220;Initial Analysis of Underhanded Source Code&amp;#8221;
(by David A. Wheeler, IDA Document D-13166, April 2020)&lt;/a&gt;.
Here&amp;#8217;s what it&amp;#8217;s about, from its executive summary:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&amp;#8220;It is possible to develop software source code that appears benign
to human review but is actually malicious. In various competitions,
such as the Obfuscated V Contest and Underhanded C Contest,
software developers have demonstrated that it is possible to solve
a data processing problem “with covert malicious behavior [in the]
source code [that] easily passes visual inspection.”
This is not merely an academic concern; in 2003, an attacker attempted to
subvert the widely used Linux kernel by inserting underhanded software
(this attack inserted code that used = instead of ==, an easily missed,
one-character difference).
This paper provides a brief initial look at
underhanded source code, with the intent to eventually help develop
countermeasures against it. &amp;#8230;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
This initial work suggests that countering underhanded code is not
an impossible task; it appears that a relatively small set of simple
countermeasures can significantly reduce the risk from underhanded
code. I recommend examining more samples, identifying a recommended
set of underhanded code countermeasures, and applying countermeasures
in situations where countering underhanded code is important and the
benefits exceed their costs.&amp;#8221;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
In my experience there are usually ways to reduce security risks,
once you know about them.
This is another case in point; once you know that this is a potential
attack, there are a variety of ways to reduce their effectiveness.
I don&amp;#8217;t think this is the last word at all on this topic, but
I hope it can be immediately applied and that others can build on it.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
This was the last paper I wrote when I worked at IDA
(I now work at the Linux Foundation).
My thanks to IDA for releasing it!
My special thanks go to Margaret Myers, Torrance Gloss, and
Reginald N. Meeson, Jr., who all worked to make this paper possible.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So if you&amp;#8217;re interested in the topic, you can view the
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ida.org/research-and-publications/publications/all/i/in/initial-analysis-of-underhanded-source-code&quot;&gt;Landing page for
IDA Document D-13166&lt;/a&gt; or go directly to the
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ida.org/-/media/feature/publications/i/in/initial-analysis-of-underhanded-source-code/d-13166.ashx&quot;
&gt;PDF for IDA DOcument D-13166,
&amp;#8220;Initial Analysis of Underhanded Source Code&amp;#8221;&lt;/a&gt;.
(If that doesn&amp;#8217;t work, use this
&lt;a href=&quot;https://perma.cc/FVQ8-EKWA&quot;&gt;Perma.cc link to paper D-13166&lt;/a&gt;.)
Enjoy!

&lt;p&gt;
Sadly, attackers have been exploiting the
COVID-19 pandemic (caused by Coronavirus SARS-CoV-2) to
cause problems via computers around the world.
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.modernhealthcare.com/cybersecurity/hackers-taking-advantage-covid-19-spread-malware&quot;&gt;Modern Healthcare&lt;/a&gt; notes that
hospitals are seeing active attacks,
emails where a sender (pretending to be from the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) asks the receiver
to open a link (which is actually malware),
other scams claim to track COVID-19 cases but actually steals personal
information.
&lt;a href=&quot;https://threatpost.com/official-government-covid-19-apps-threats/154512/&quot;
&gt;Many official government COVID-19 mobile applications have
threats&lt;/a&gt; (ranging from malware to incredibly basic security
problems).
For example, in Columbia the government released
a mobile app called CoronApp-Colombia to help people track potential
COVID-19 symptoms; the intention is great, but as of March 25 it failed
to use HTTPS (secure communication), and instead used HTTP
(insecure) to relay personal data (including health data).
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
In the long term, the solution is for software developers and operators
to do a much better job in creating and deploying secure applications.
In the short term,
&lt;a href=&quot;https://hbr.org/2020/03/will-coronavirus-lead-to-more-cyber-attacks&quot;
&gt;we need to take extra care about our computer security&lt;/a&gt;.

The Linux Foundation and the Laboratory for Innovation
Science at Harvard have just released a new report:
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.coreinfrastructure.org/programs/census-program-ii/&quot;
&gt;“Vulnerabilities in the Core: Preliminary Report and
Census II of Open Source Software” by Frank Nagle, Jessica
Wilkerson, James Dana, and Jennifer L. Hoffman, 2020-02-14&lt;/a&gt;.
Just click on “Download Report” when you get there.  &lt;a
href=&quot;https://www.hbs.edu/news/releases/Pages/census-open-source-software-security.aspx&quot;
&gt;A summary is available from Harvard&lt;/a&gt;.
Here&amp;#8217;s a quick introduction to the paper.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Their long-term goal is to figure out what FOSS packages are most
critical through data analysis.  This turns out to extremely difficult,
as discussed in the paper, and they expressly state that their current
results “cannot - and do not purport to - be a definitive claim of which
FOSS packages are the most critical”.  That said, they have developed
a method as a “proof of concept” to start working towards that answer.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
They describe their approach in detail. Here’s a quick summary.
First they use data from Software Composition Analysis
(SCAs) and application security companies, including Snyk and Synopsys
Cybersecurity Research Center, to identify components used in actual systems.
They then use dependency analysis (via libraries.io) to identify indirect (transitive) dependencies.
Finally, they averaged the Z-scores to provide normalized rankings.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Here are some key lessons learned from the report (Chapter 7):
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There’s a need for a standardized naming scheme for software components.
&lt;li&gt;There’s an increasing importance of individual developer account security.
&lt;li&gt;Legacy software persists in the open source space.
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Also, here&amp;#8217;s an interesting nugget:
“These statistics illustrate an interesting pattern: a high
correlation between being employed and being a top contributor to one
of the FOSS packages identified as most used.”
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I’m on the CII Steering Committee, so I did comment on an earlier draft,
but credit goes to the actual authors.
