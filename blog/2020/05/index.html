<p>
On 2019-06-24 parts of the Internet became inaccessible because
Verizon failed to implement a key security measure called
<a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/rpki/"
>Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI)</a>.
<a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/how-verizon-and-a-bgp-optimizer-knocked-large-parts-of-the-internet-offline-today/"
>Here&#8217;s a brief story about the 2019 failure by Verizon</a>, with

>follow-on details</a>.
</p>
<p>
What&#8217;s shocking is that Verizon is <i>still</i> failing to implement RPKI.
Verizon&#8217;s continuing failure continues to make it trivial
for both accidents and
malicious actors (including governments) to shut down large swathes of
the Internet, including networks around the US capital.
That&#8217;s especially absurd because during the
COVID-19 pandemic we have become <i>more</i> dependent on the Internet.
There have been many routine failures by accident or on purpose;
it&#8217;s past time to deploy the basic countermeasure (RPKI) to deal with it.
Verizon needs to implement RPKI, as many other operators already have.
</p>
<p>
The fundamental problem is that the Internet depends on a routing system
called Border Gateway Protocol (BGP), which never included a
(useful) security mechanism.
<a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/rpki/">Resource Public Key (RPKI)</a>
provides an important security mechanism to counter certain kinds of
BGP problems (either by accident or on purpose).

>&#8220;Why it&#8217;s time to deploy RPKI&#8221; (RIPE NCC, 2019-05-17)</a>
is a short 2-minute video that explains why it&#8217;s past time to deploy RPKI.
</p>
<p>
Verizon already knows that they&#8217;re failing to support RPKI; here&#8217;s a
<a href="https://forums.verizon.com/t5/Fios-Internet/Verizon-FIOS-does-NOT-provide-important-network-security-known/td-p/895575">complaint
posted on 2020-04-19 7:16AM that Verizon wasn&#8217;t supporting RPKI</a>.
It&#8217;s clear RPKI is useful;
<a href="https://blog.thousandeyes.com/visualizing-the-benefits-of-rpki/"
>&#8220;Visualizing the Benefits of RPKI&#8221; by Kemal Sanjta (2019-07-19)</a>
shows how RPKI really does help.
</p>
<p>
If you&#8217;re a Verizon customer, you can easily verify Verizon&#8217;s status via
<a href="https://isbgpsafeyet.com/"
>Is BGP safe yet?</a>.
The answer for Verizon users is &#8220;no&#8221;.
</p>
<p>
If your Internet Service Provider (ISP) doesn&#8217;t support RPKI, please
nag them to do so.
If you&#8217;re a government, and your ISPs won&#8217;t yet support RPKI,
ask when they&#8217;re going secure their network with this basic security measure.
It will take work, and it won&#8217;t solve all problems in the universe,
but those are merely excuses for failure; those statements describe
all things that should be done.
RPKI is an important minimum part of securing the Internet, and it&#8217;s time
to ensure that every Internet Service Provider (ISP) supports it.

<p><a name="ntia-sbom"><font size="+2"><b>Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) work at NTIA</b></font></a></p><p></p>
<p>
Modern software systems contain many components, which themselves
contain components, which themselves contain components.
Which raises some important questions, for example,
when a vulnerability is publicly identified, how do you know if
your system is affected?
Another issue involves licensing - how can you be confident that
you are meeting all your legal obligations?
This is getting harder to do as systems get bigger, and also because
software development is a global activity.
</p>

<p>
On July 19, 2018, the US National Telecommunications and Information
Administration (NTIA) &#8220;convened a meeting of stakeholders from across
multiple sectors to begin a discussion about software transparency and
the proposal being considered for a common structure for describing the
software components in a product containing software.&#8221;
[<i>Framing Software Component Transparency: Establishing a Common Software
Bill of Material (SBOM)</i>]
</p>

<p>
A key part of this is to make it much easier to define and exchange a
&#8220;Software Bill of Materials&#8221; (SBOM).
You can see a lot of their information at the
<a href="https://www.ntia.gov/sbom">Community-Drafted
Documents on Software Bill of Materials</a>.
If you&#8217;re interested in this topic, that&#8217;s a decent place to start.

<p><a name="underhanded-code"><font size="+2"><b>Initial Analysis of Underhanded Source Code</b></font></a></p><p></p>
<p>
Announcing - a newly-available security paper I wrote! It&#8217;s titled
<a href="https://www.ida.org/-/media/feature/publications/i/in/initial-analysis-of-underhanded-source-code/d-13166.ashx"
>&#8220;Initial Analysis of Underhanded Source Code&#8221;
(by David A. Wheeler, IDA Document D-13166, April 2020)</a>.
Here&#8217;s what it&#8217;s about, from its executive summary:
</p>
<blockquote>
&#8220;It is possible to develop software source code that appears benign
to human review but is actually malicious. In various competitions,
such as the Obfuscated V Contest and Underhanded C Contest,
software developers have demonstrated that it is possible to solve
a data processing problem “with covert malicious behavior [in the]
source code [that] easily passes visual inspection.”
This is not merely an academic concern; in 2003, an attacker attempted to
subvert the widely used Linux kernel by inserting underhanded software
(this attack inserted code that used = instead of ==, an easily missed,
one-character difference).
This paper provides a brief initial look at
underhanded source code, with the intent to eventually help develop
countermeasures against it. &#8230;
<br><br>
This initial work suggests that countering underhanded code is not
an impossible task; it appears that a relatively small set of simple
countermeasures can significantly reduce the risk from underhanded
code. I recommend examining more samples, identifying a recommended
set of underhanded code countermeasures, and applying countermeasures
in situations where countering underhanded code is important and the
benefits exceed their costs.&#8221;
</blockquote>

<p>
In my experience there are usually ways to reduce security risks,
once you know about them.
This is another case in point; once you know that this is a potential
attack, there are a variety of ways to reduce their effectiveness.
I don&#8217;t think this is the last word at all on this topic, but
I hope it can be immediately applied and that others can build on it.
</p>

<p>
This was the last paper I wrote when I worked at IDA
(I now work at the Linux Foundation).
My thanks to IDA for releasing it!
My special thanks go to Margaret Myers, Torrance Gloss, and
Reginald N. Meeson, Jr., who all worked to make this paper possible.
</p>
