Modern software systems contain many components, which themselves
contain components, which themselves contain components.
Which raises some important questions, for example,
when a vulnerability is publicly identified, how do you know if
your system is affected?
Another issue involves licensing - how can you be confident that
you are meeting all your legal obligations?
This is getting harder to do as systems get bigger, and also because
software development is a global activity.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
On July 19, 2018, the US National Telecommunications and Information
Administration (NTIA) &amp;#8220;convened a meeting of stakeholders from across
multiple sectors to begin a discussion about software transparency and
the proposal being considered for a common structure for describing the
software components in a product containing software.&amp;#8221;
[&lt;i&gt;Framing Software Component Transparency: Establishing a Common Software
Bill of Material (SBOM)&lt;/i&gt;]
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
A key part of this is to make it much easier to define and exchange a
&amp;#8220;Software Bill of Materials&amp;#8221; (SBOM).
You can see a lot of their information at the
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ntia.gov/sbom&quot;&gt;Community-Drafted
Documents on Software Bill of Materials&lt;/a&gt;.
If you&amp;#8217;re interested in this topic, that&amp;#8217;s a decent place to start.
&lt;/p&gt;
