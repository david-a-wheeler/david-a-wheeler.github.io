<p><a name="cii-survey"><font size="+2"><b>FOSS Contributor Survey</b></font></a></p><p></p>
<p>
If you contribute to Free/Open Source Software,
please take the
<a href="https://hbs.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_enfu6tjRM0QzwQB"
>FOSS Contributor Survey</a>!
</p>

<p>
This survey is a collaboration between the Linux Foundation&#8217;s Core
Infrastructure Initiative and the Laboratory for Innovation Science
at Harvard. Some of the questions are specific to those who write
software; if you contribute, but don&#8217;t write software, just skip
those questions.
The goal is to get a better understanding about its development so that
we can best work out how to improve its security and sustainability.
</p>

<p>
Also: please tell others who develop this software about the survey!
</p>

<p>
One interesting complication about this survey is that it&#8217;s difficult to
get the word out about such a general survey.
People talk about the &#8220;open source software community&#8221;, but in practice
there isn&#8217;t <i>one</i> such community, there are many communities
with some overlap.
I don&#8217;t want to spam people who have never expressed any interest
in information like this.
</p>

<p>
I&#8217;m currently talking with some folks in the Linux Foundatinon leadership
about sending a one-time email <i>only</i> to developers who are
<i>already</i> signed up for Linux Foundation mailing lists
that are focused on developing open source software.
We don&#8217;t want to spam people, but I think it&#8217;s reasonable to believe
that people on those mailing lists <i>are</i> interestd in information
related to the development of open source software.
One problem with sending to multiple mailing lists is that we don&#8217;t want
to annoy people by having them receive multiple copies, so we want
to work out a way so an individual only gets one copy.
</p>

<p>
I&#8217;ve never done this before, and I hate spam myself.
So I&#8217;m <i>first</i> checking with Linux Foundation leaders and program
managers to see if they think this is reasonable.
I think it is, but it&#8217;s easy to justify anything to yourself, so
I&#8217;m waiting to hear from others about what they think.
</p>

<p>
So getting back to the point -
