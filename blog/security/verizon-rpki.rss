On 2019-06-24 parts of the Internet became inaccessible because
Verizon failed to implement a key security measure called
&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.cloudflare.com/rpki/&quot;
&gt;Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI)&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.cloudflare.com/how-verizon-and-a-bgp-optimizer-knocked-large-parts-of-the-internet-offline-today/&quot;
&gt;Here&amp;#8217;s a brief story about the 2019 failure by Verizon&lt;/a&gt;, with
&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.cloudflare.com/the-deep-dive-into-how-verizon-and-a-bgp-optimizer-knocked-large-parts-of-the-internet-offline-monday/&quot;
&gt;follow-on details&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
What&amp;#8217;s shocking is that Verizon is &lt;i&gt;still&lt;/i&gt; failing to implement RPKI.
Verizon&amp;#8217;s continuing failure continues to make it trivial
for both accidents and
malicious actors (including governments) to shut down large swathes of
the Internet, including networks around the US capital.
That&amp;#8217;s especially absurd because during the
COVID-19 pandemic we have become &lt;i&gt;more&lt;/i&gt; dependent on the Internet.
There have been many routine failures by accident or on purpose;
it&amp;#8217;s past time to deploy the basic countermeasure (RPKI) to deal with it.
Verizon needs to implement RPKI, as many other operators already have.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The fundamental problem is that the Internet depends on a routing system
called Border Gateway Protocol (BGP), which never included a
(useful) security mechanism.
&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.cloudflare.com/rpki/&quot;&gt;Resource Public Key (RPKI)&lt;/a&gt;
provides an important security mechanism to counter certain kinds of
BGP problems (either by accident or on purpose).
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9vbbxr-GbI&quot;
&gt;&amp;#8220;Why it&amp;#8217;s time to deploy RPKI&amp;#8221; (RIPE NCC, 2019-05-17)&lt;/a&gt;
is a short 2-minute video that explains why it&amp;#8217;s past time to deploy RPKI.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Verizon already knows that they&amp;#8217;re failing to support RPKI; here&amp;#8217;s a
&lt;a href=&quot;https://forums.verizon.com/t5/Fios-Internet/Verizon-FIOS-does-NOT-provide-important-network-security-known/td-p/895575&quot;&gt;complaint
posted on 2020-04-19 7:16AM that Verizon wasn&amp;#8217;t supporting RPKI&lt;/a&gt;.
It&amp;#8217;s clear RPKI is useful;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.thousandeyes.com/visualizing-the-benefits-of-rpki/&quot;
&gt;&amp;#8220;Visualizing the Benefits of RPKI&amp;#8221; by Kemal Sanjta (2019-07-19)&lt;/a&gt;
shows how RPKI really does help.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If you&amp;#8217;re a Verizon customer, you can easily verify Verizon&amp;#8217;s status via
&lt;a href=&quot;https://isbgpsafeyet.com/&quot;
&gt;Is BGP safe yet?&lt;/a&gt;.
The answer for Verizon users is &amp;#8220;no&amp;#8221;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If your Internet Service Provider (ISP) doesn&amp;#8217;t support RPKI, please
nag them to do so.
If you&amp;#8217;re a government, and your ISPs won&amp;#8217;t yet support RPKI,
ask when they&amp;#8217;re going secure their network with this basic security measure.
It will take work, and it won&amp;#8217;t solve all problems in the universe,
but those are merely excuses for failure; those statements describe
all things that should be done.
RPKI is an important minimum part of securing the Internet, and it&amp;#8217;s time
to ensure that every Internet Service Provider (ISP) supports it.
&lt;/p&gt;
