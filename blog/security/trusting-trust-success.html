<p>
My November 23 public defense of
<b><a href="http://www.dwheeler.com/trusting-trust/">Fully Countering Trusting Trust through Diverse Double-Compiling</a></b>
went well.
This was my 2009 PhD dissertation that expands on how to counter the
&#8220;trusting trust&#8221; attack by
using the &#8220;Diverse Double-Compiling&#8221; (DDC) technique.
</p>

<p>
Most importantly (to me), my PhD committee agreed that I successfully
defended my dissertation.
Whew!
As a result, I&#8217;m essentially done with my PhD.
</p>

<p>
I learned a lot about creating formal proofs using computers by
doing this dissertation.
I wanted to give the strongest possible evidence that DDC counters
the trusting trust attack, and formal proofs are the strongest
form of proof that I know of&#8230; which is why I created them.
Frankly, creating proofs was kind of fun once I knew what I was doing, but
getting there was more painful than it needed to be.
Many books are on the underlying mathematics (e.g., giving you extreme
detail about various logic systems)&#8230; which is great if you&#8217;re a
mathematician, but not so helpful if you are simply trying to
<i>use</i> the mathematics.
Some books explain how to do things by hand, but that is an
unnecessary amount of pain; one of my proofs is 30 steps long, and I
sure wouldn&#8217;t have wanted to create that by hand.
Some books seemed to assume that you <i>already</i> knew everything
the book covered, which is an odd assumption to me :-).
</p>

<p>
Here&#8217;s a trivial example: Most logic systems can prove <i>anything</i>
if you give them inconsistent assumptions.
That&#8217;s bad!
You can get rid of that problem by sending the assumptions to a
model-builder like mace4&#8230; if
it can create a model, then the assumptions are consistent.
So, make sure you send your assumptions
through a model-builder to see if your assumptions are consistent.
</p>

<p>
I&#8217;ve posted
<a href="http://www.dwheeler.com/trusting-trust/dissertation/">
detailed data from my dissertation</a>
so that people can reproduce my results.
I think it&#8217;s really important
that results be reduceable, otherwise, it&#8217;s not science.
As part of that data, I&#8217;ve included a few files
that may help potential proof tool users get started.
In particular, I&#8217;ve posted
<a href="http://www.dwheeler.com/trusting-trust/dissertation/mortal.in">prover9 input to prove that Socrates is mortal</a>, a
<a href="http://www.dwheeler.com/trusting-trust/dissertation/sqrt2.in">prover9 input to prove that the
square root of 2 is irrational</a>,
and
<a href="http://www.dwheeler.com/trusting-trust/dissertation/distinct.in">prover9 input showing
how to easily declare that terms in a list are distinct</a>.
</p>


<p>
The &#8220;trusting trust&#8221; attack
has historically been considered the &#8220;uncounterable&#8221; attack.
Now the attack can be effectively detected &mdash; and thus countered.
