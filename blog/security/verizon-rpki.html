On 2019-06-24 parts of the Internet became inaccessible because
Verizon failed to implement a key security measure called
<a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/rpki/"
>Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI)</a>.

What&#8217;s shocking is that Verizon is <i>still</i> failing to implement RPKI.
Verizon&#8217;s continuing failure continues to make it trivial
for both accidents and
malicious actors (including governments) to shut down large swathes of
the Internet, including networks around the US capital.
That&#8217;s especially absurd because during the
COVID-19 pandemic we have become <i>more</i> dependent on the Internet.
There have been many routine failures by accident or on purpose;
it&#8217;s past time to deploy the basic countermeasure (RPKI) to deal with it.
Verizon needs to implement RPKI, as many other operators already have.
</p>
<p>
The fundamental problem is that the Internet depends on a routing system
called Border Gateway Protocol (BGP), which never included a
(useful) security mechanism.
<a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/rpki/">Resource Public Key (RPKI)</a>
provides an important security mechanism to counter certain kinds of
BGP problems (either by accident or on purpose).

>&#8220;Why it&#8217;s time to deploy RPKI&#8221; (RIPE NCC, 2019-05-17)</a>
is a short 2-minute video that explains why it&#8217;s past time to deploy RPKI.
</p>
<p>
Verizon already knows that they&#8217;re failing to support RPKI; here&#8217;s a
<a href="https://forums.verizon.com/t5/Fios-Internet/Verizon-FIOS-does-NOT-provide-important-network-security-known/td-p/895575">complaint
posted on 2020-04-19 7:16AM that Verizon wasn&#8217;t supporting RPKI</a>.
It&#8217;s clear RPKI is useful;

>&#8220;Visualizing the Benefits of RPKI&#8221; by Kemal Sanjta (2019-07-19)</a>
shows how RPKI really does help.
</p>
<p>
If you&#8217;re a Verizon customer, you can easily verify Verizon&#8217;s status via
<a href="https://isbgpsafeyet.com/"
>Is BGP safe yet?</a>.
The answer for Verizon users is &#8220;no&#8221;.
</p>
<p>
If your Internet Service Provider (ISP) doesn&#8217;t support RPKI, please
nag them to do so.
If you&#8217;re a government, and your ISPs won&#8217;t yet support RPKI,
ask when they&#8217;re going secure their network with this basic security measure.
It will take work, and it won&#8217;t solve all problems in the universe,
but those are merely excuses for failure; those statements describe
all things that should be done.
RPKI is an important minimum part of securing the Internet, and it&#8217;s time
to ensure that every Internet Service Provider (ISP) supports it.
