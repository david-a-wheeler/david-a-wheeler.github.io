<p>
Sadly, attackers have been exploiting the
COVID-19 pandemic (caused by Coronavirus SARS-CoV-2) to
cause problems via computers around the world.
<a href="https://www.modernhealthcare.com/cybersecurity/hackers-taking-advantage-covid-19-spread-malware">Modern Healthcare</a> notes that
hospitals are seeing active attacks,
emails where a sender (pretending to be from the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) asks the receiver
to open a link (which is actually malware),
other scams claim to track COVID-19 cases but actually steals personal
information.

>Many official government COVID-19 mobile applications have
threats</a> (ranging from malware to incredibly basic security
problems).
For example, in Columbia the government released
a mobile app called CoronApp-Colombia to help people track potential
COVID-19 symptoms; the intention is great, but as of March 25 it failed
to use HTTPS (secure communication), and instead used HTTP
(insecure) to relay personal data (including health data).

<p>
In the long term, the solution is for software developers and operators
to do a much better job in creating and deploying secure applications.
In the short term,

>we need to take extra care about our computer security</a>.
