<p>
A number of people have recently been discussing or referring to
my PhD work,
<a href="http://www.dwheeler.com/trusting-trust/">&#8220;Fully Countering Trusting Trust through Diverse Double-Compiling (DDC)&#8221;</a>,
which
<a href="http://www.dwheeler.com/trusting-trust/">counters Trojan Horse attacks on compilers</a>.
<a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/1m4mwn/a_simple_way_of_defeating_the_compiler_backdoor/">Last week&#8217;s discussion on reddit</a>
based on a short
<a href="http://imgur.com/a/BWbnU#0">short slide show</a>
discussed it directly, for example.
There have also been related discussions such as
<a href="https://blog.torproject.org/blog/deterministic-builds-part-one-cyberwar-and-global-compromise">Tor&#8217;s work on creating deterministic builds</a>.
</p>
<p>
For everyone who&#8217;s interested in DDC&#8230; welcome!
I intentionally posted my dissertation, and a video about it,
directly on the Internet with no paywall.
That way, anyone who wants the information can immediately get it.

I even include enough background material
so other people
can independently repeat my experiments and verify my claims.
I believe that
if you cannot reproduce the results, it is not science&#8230;
and a lot of computational research has stopped being a science.
This is not a new observation;
<a href="http://academiccommons.columbia.edu/catalog/ac:140124">&#8220;Reproducible Research: Addressing the Need for Data and Code Sharing in Computational Science&#8221; by Victoria C. Stodden (Computing in Science &amp; Engineering, 2010)</a> summarizes a roundtable on
this very problem.
The roadtable found that
&#8220;Progress in computational science
is often hampered by researchers&#8217;
inability to independently
reproduce or verify published results&#8221;
and, along with a number of specific steps,
&#8220;reproducibility must be embraced
at the cultural level within the
computational science community.&#8221;
<a href="http://www.isgtw.org/feature/does-computation-threaten-scientific-method">&#8220;Does computation threaten the scientific method
(by Leslie Hatton and Adrian Giordani)</a>
and
<a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v482/n7386/full/nature10836.html">
&#8220;The case for open computer programs&#8221; in <i>Nature</i>
(by Darrel C. Ince, Leslie Hatton, and John Graham-Cumming)</a>
make similar points.
For one of many examples, the paper
<a href="http://fmv.jku.at/papers/Biere-ETH-TR-444-2004.pdf">&#8220;The Evolution from LIMMAT to NANOSAT&#8221; by Armin Biere (Technical Report #444, 15 April 2004)</a>
reported that they could not reproduce results because
&#8220;From the publications
alone, without access to the source code,
various details were still unclear.&#8221;
In the end they realized that
&#8220;making source code&#8230; available is as important
to the advancement of the field as publications&#8221;.
I think we should not pay researchers, or their institutions,
if they fail to provide the materials necessary to reproduce the work.

I do have a request, though.
There is no patent on DDC,
nor is there a legal requirement to report using it.
Still, if you apply my approach, please
<a href="http://www.dwheeler.com/contactme.html">let me know</a>;
I&#8217;d like to hear about it.
Alternatively, if you are <i>seriously</i> trying to use DDC
but are having some problems,
<a href="http://www.dwheeler.com/contactme.html">let me know</a>.
