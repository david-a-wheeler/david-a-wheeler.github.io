<p><a name="race-conditions"><font size="+2"><b>New Security Article on Race Conditions</b></font></a></p><p></p>
Well, I&#8217;m happy to announce that another one
of my developerworks article on secure development is
now out for the public.
Go take a look at
<a href="http://www-128.ibm.com/developerworks/library-combined/l-sprace.html">
Secure programmer: Preventing Race Conditions</a>.
<p>
This was a trickier article to write, because race conditions are
harder to describe in a simple way.
No matter what, they always involve subtle timing interactions, and
that makes them hard to describe.
Even the conventional definitions are too complicated and don&#8217;t really
help explain the issue.
So, I ended up writing my own definition:
A &#8220;race condition&#8221; occurs when a program doesn&#8217;t work as it&#8217;s supposed to
because of an unexpected ordering of events that produces contention over the
same resource. Notice that a race condition doesn&#8217;t need to involve contention
between two parts of the same program; many security problems occur if an
outside attacker can interfere with a program in unexpected ways. 
<p>
And from there, it shows some of those big surprises.
A whole bunch of race conditions have been found over the last few
months, so this is certainly still a serious problem.
