<p>
Big news in computer security: Hanno Boeck has recently managed to get
<a href="https://blog.hboeck.de/archives/879-Safer-use-of-C-code-running-Gentoo-with-Address-Sanitizer.html">Address Sanitizer running on an
entire Linux distribution (Gentoo)</a> as an experimental edition.
For those who don&#8217;t know,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AddressSanitizer">Address Sanitizer</a>
is an amazing compile-time option that detects a huge range of memory errors
in memory-unsafe languages (in particular C and C++).
These kinds of errors often lead to disastrous security vulnerabilities,
such as
<a href="http://www.dwheeler.com/essays/heartbleed">Heartbleed</a>.
</p>
<p>
This kind of distribution option is absolutely not for everyone.
Address Sanitizer on average increases processing time by about 73%,
and memory usage by 340%.
What&#8217;s more, this work is currently very experimental,
and you have to disable some other security mechanisms to make it work.
That said, this effort has already borne a lot of valuable fruit.
Turning on these mechanisms across
an entire Linux distribution has revealed a large number of memory errors
that are getting fixed.
I can easily imagine this being directly useful in the future, too.
Computers are very fast and have lots of memory, even when compared
to computers of just a few years earlier.
There are definitely situations where it&#8217;s okay to effectively
halve performance and reduce <i>useful</i> memory, and in exchange,
significantly increase the system&#8217;s resistance to novel attack.
My congrats!!
