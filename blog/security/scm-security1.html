<p><a name="scm-security1"><font size="+2"><b>Updated my essay on Software Configuration Management Security</b></font></a></p><p></p>
I&#8217;ve updated my essay on
<a href="http://www.dwheeler.com/essays/scm-security.html">Software Configuration Management (SCM) Security</a>.
That essay is relatively new, and I&#8217;ve added more now.
Today we use SCM tools to manage our complicated software,
yet we&#8217;re not paying enough attention to those tools&#8217; security
requirements.
<p>
For example, few SCM tools think about the problem of handling
malicious developers (who are <i>trying</i> to insert Trojan horses) or
about countering people who gain root access on a centralized system
being used as the SCM data repository&#8230; even though that&#8217;s already
happening.
There <i>are</i> ways to deal with those kinds of attacks&#8230; but you
have to think about them to counter them.
<p>
One of the recent additions to the essay
is based on an interesting email I received from
Dr. Carsten Bormann of the University of Bremen.
He mentioned a specialized attack that he terms the
&#8220;encumbrance pollution attack&#8221;.
In an encumberance pollution attack, the attacker inserts material
that cannot be legally included.
<p>
To understand it, first
imagine an SCM with perfectly indestructible history.
The attacker steals developer credentials, or is himself a malicious
developer, and checks in a change that contains some encumbered material.
&#8220;Encumbered&#8221; material is simply material which cannot be legally included.
Examples include child pornography, slanderous/libelous statements, or
code which has copyright or patent encumberances.
This could be very advantageous, for example, a company
might hire a malicious developer to insert that company&#8217;s code into a
competing product, and then sue the competitor for copyright infringement,
knowing that their SCM system &#8220;can&#8217;t&#8221; undo the problem.
Or a lazy programmer might copy code that they have no right to copy
(this is rare in open source software projects, because every line of code
and who provided it is a matter of public record, but it proprietary
projects do have this risk).
<p>
Any SCM can record a change that essentially undoes a previous change,
but if the history is indestructable and viewable by all, then
you can&#8217;t get rid of the history.
This makes your SCM archive irrevocably encumbered.
This can especially be a problem if the SCM is indestructably recording
proposals by outsiders!
<p>
