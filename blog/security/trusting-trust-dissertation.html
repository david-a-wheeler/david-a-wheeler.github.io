<p>
An Air Force evaluation of Multics, and Ken Thompson&#8217;s Turing award
lecture (&#8220;Reflections on Trusting Trust&#8221;), showed that compilers can
be subverted to insert malicious Trojan horses into critical software,
<i>including themselves</i>.  If this &#8220;trusting trust&#8221; attack goes undetected,
even complete analysis of a system&#8217;s source code will not find the
malicious code that is running.  Previously-known countermeasures have
been grossly inadequate.  If this attack cannot be countered, attackers
can quietly subvert entire classes of computer systems, gaining complete
control over financial, infrastructure, military, and/or business
system infrastructures worldwide.
</p>
<p>
Thankfully, there <i>is</i> a countermeasure to the
&#8220;trusting trust&#8221; attack.
In 2005
<a href="http://www.dwheeler.com/trusting-trust">I wrote a paper on Diverse Double-Compiling (DDC), published by ACSAC</a>, where I explained DDC and
why it is an effective countermeasure.
But some people still raised concerns.
Would DDC <i>really</i> counter the attack?
Would DDC scale up to real-world compilers?
Also, the ACSAC paper required &#8220;self-parenting&#8221; compilers &mdash;
can DDC handle compilers that are <i>not</i> self-parenting?
</p>
<p>
I&#8217;m now releasing
<b><a href="http://www.dwheeler.com/trusting-trust/">Fully Countering Trusting Trust through Diverse Double-Compiling</a></b>,
my 2009 PhD dissertation that expands on how to counter the
&#8220;trusting trust&#8221; attack by using the &#8220;Diverse Double-Compiling&#8221; (DDC)
technique.
This dissertation was accepted by my PhD committee on October 26, 2009.

<p>
On <b>November 23, 2009, 1-3pm</b>, I will be giving a
<b>public defense</b> of this dissertation.

This dissertation&#8217;s thesis is that
the trusting trust attack can be detected and effectively countered
using the &#8220;Diverse Double-Compiling&#8221; (DDC) technique, as demonstrated by
(1) a formal proof that DDC can determine if source code and generated
executable code correspond, (2) a demonstration of DDC with four compilers
(a small C compiler, a small Lisp compiler, a small maliciously corrupted
Lisp compiler, and a large industrial-strength C compiler, GCC), and
(3) a description of approaches for applying DDC in various real-world
scenarios.  In the DDC technique, source code is compiled twice: once
with a second (trusted) compiler (using the source code of the compiler&#8217;s
parent), and then the compiler source code is compiled using the result
of the first compilation.  If the result is bit-for-bit identical with
the untrusted executable, then the source code accurately represents
the executable.

Many people commented on my previous 2005 ACSAC paper on the topic.
<a href="http://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2006/01/countering_trus.html">
Bruce Schneier wrote an article on &#8216;Countering &#8220;Trusting Trust&#8221;&#8217;</a>,
which I think is one of the best independent articles describing my work
on DDC.
</p>
<p>
This 2009 dissertation significantly extends my previous 2005 ACSAC paper.
For example, I now have a formal proof that DDC is effective
(the ACSAC paper only had an informal justification).
I also have additional demonstrations, including one with GCC
(to show that it scales up) and one with a maliciously corrupted compiler
(to show that it really does detect them in the real world).
The dissertation is also more general; the ACSAC paper only considered
the special case of a &#8220;self-parenting&#8221; compiler,
while the dissertation eliminates that assumption.
</p>
<p>
So if you&#8217;re interested in countering the &#8220;trusting trust&#8221; attack,
please take a look at my
<a href="http://www.dwheeler.com/trusting-trust/">work on countering trusting trust through diverse double-compiling (DDC)</a>.
