&lt;p&gt;
My November 23 public defense of
&lt;b&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dwheeler.com/trusting-trust/&quot;&gt;Fully Countering Trusting Trust through Diverse Double-Compiling&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
went well.
This was my 2009 PhD dissertation that expands on how to counter the
&amp;#8220;trusting trust&amp;#8221; attack by
using the &amp;#8220;Diverse Double-Compiling&amp;#8221; (DDC) technique.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Most importantly (to me), my PhD committee agreed that I successfully
defended my dissertation.
Whew!
As a result, I&amp;#8217;m essentially done with my PhD.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I learned a lot about creating formal proofs using computers by
doing this dissertation.
I wanted to give the strongest possible evidence that DDC counters
the trusting trust attack, and formal proofs are the strongest
form of proof that I know of&amp;#8230; which is why I created them.
Frankly, creating proofs was kind of fun once I knew what I was doing, but
getting there was more painful than it needed to be.
Many books are on the underlying mathematics (e.g., giving you extreme
detail about various logic systems)&amp;#8230; which is great if you&amp;#8217;re a
mathematician, but not so helpful if you are simply trying to
&lt;i&gt;use&lt;/i&gt; the mathematics.
Some books explain how to do things by hand, but that is an
unnecessary amount of pain; one of my proofs is 30 steps long, and I
sure wouldn&amp;#8217;t have wanted to create that by hand.
Some books seemed to assume that you &lt;i&gt;already&lt;/i&gt; knew everything
the book covered, which is an odd assumption to me :-).
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Here&amp;#8217;s a trivial example: Most logic systems can prove &lt;i&gt;anything&lt;/i&gt;
if you give them inconsistent assumptions.
That&amp;#8217;s bad!
You can get rid of that problem by sending the assumptions to a
model-builder like mace4&amp;#8230; if
it can create a model, then the assumptions are consistent.
So, make sure you send your assumptions
through a model-builder to see if your assumptions are consistent.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I&amp;#8217;ve posted
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dwheeler.com/trusting-trust/dissertation/&quot;&gt;
detailed data from my dissertation&lt;/a&gt;
so that people can reproduce my results.
I think it&amp;#8217;s really important
that results be reduceable, otherwise, it&amp;#8217;s not science.
As part of that data, I&amp;#8217;ve included a few files
that may help potential proof tool users get started.
In particular, I&amp;#8217;ve posted
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dwheeler.com/trusting-trust/dissertation/mortal.in&quot;&gt;prover9 input to prove that Socrates is mortal&lt;/a&gt;, a
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dwheeler.com/trusting-trust/dissertation/sqrt2.in&quot;&gt;prover9 input to prove that the
square root of 2 is irrational&lt;/a&gt;,
and
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dwheeler.com/trusting-trust/dissertation/distinct.in&quot;&gt;prover9 input showing
how to easily declare that terms in a list are distinct&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;
The &amp;#8220;trusting trust&amp;#8221; attack
has historically been considered the &amp;#8220;uncounterable&amp;#8221; attack.
Now the attack can be effectively detected &amp;mdash; and thus countered.
&lt;/p&gt;
