If you&amp;#8217;re doing software research and development
(especially on how to improve computer security),
and are thinking about using an open source software (OSS) approach
but don&amp;#8217;t know a lot about it,
here&amp;#8217;s something that may help:
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ida.org//~/media/Corporate/Files/Publications/IDA_Documents/ITSD/2016/P-5279.ashx&quot;&gt;Using an Open Source Software Approach for Cybersecurity Technology Transition (IDA paper P-5279, aka the &amp;#8220;PI guide&amp;#8221;)&lt;/a&gt;.
If you&amp;#8217;re an old hand at developing Free/ libre/ open source software
(FLOSS or OSS), you probably know most of this information.
However, I&amp;#8217;ve found that a lot of people could use a hand.
Here&amp;#8217;s that helping hand.
&lt;/p&gt;

Big news in computer security: Hanno Boeck has recently managed to get
&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.hboeck.de/archives/879-Safer-use-of-C-code-running-Gentoo-with-Address-Sanitizer.html&quot;&gt;Address Sanitizer running on an
entire Linux distribution (Gentoo)&lt;/a&gt; as an experimental edition.
For those who don&amp;#8217;t know,
&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AddressSanitizer&quot;&gt;Address Sanitizer&lt;/a&gt;
is an amazing compile-time option that detects a huge range of memory errors
in memory-unsafe languages (in particular C and C++).
These kinds of errors often lead to disastrous security vulnerabilities,
such as
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dwheeler.com/essays/heartbleed&quot;&gt;Heartbleed&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This kind of distribution option is absolutely not for everyone.
Address Sanitizer on average increases processing time by about 73%,
and memory usage by 340%.
What&amp;#8217;s more, this work is currently very experimental,
and you have to disable some other security mechanisms to make it work.
That said, this effort has already borne a lot of valuable fruit.
Turning on these mechanisms across
an entire Linux distribution has revealed a large number of memory errors
that are getting fixed.
I can easily imagine this being directly useful in the future, too.
Computers are very fast and have lots of memory, even when compared
to computers of just a few years earlier.
There are definitely situations where it&amp;#8217;s okay to effectively
halve performance and reduce &lt;i&gt;useful&lt;/i&gt; memory, and in exchange,
significantly increase the system&amp;#8217;s resistance to novel attack.
My congrats!!
&lt;/p&gt;
