<p>
If you&#8217;re doing software research and development
(especially on how to improve computer security),
and are thinking about using an open source software (OSS) approach
but don&#8217;t know a lot about it,
here&#8217;s something that may help:
<a href="https://www.ida.org//~/media/Corporate/Files/Publications/IDA_Documents/ITSD/2016/P-5279.ashx">Using an Open Source Software Approach for Cybersecurity Technology Transition (IDA paper P-5279, aka the &#8220;PI guide&#8221;)</a>.
If you&#8217;re an old hand at developing Free/ libre/ open source software
(FLOSS or OSS), you probably know most of this information.
However, I&#8217;ve found that a lot of people could use a hand.
Here&#8217;s that helping hand.

<p>
Big news in computer security: Hanno Boeck has recently managed to get
<a href="https://blog.hboeck.de/archives/879-Safer-use-of-C-code-running-Gentoo-with-Address-Sanitizer.html">Address Sanitizer running on an
entire Linux distribution (Gentoo)</a> as an experimental edition.
For those who don&#8217;t know,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AddressSanitizer">Address Sanitizer</a>
is an amazing compile-time option that detects a huge range of memory errors
in memory-unsafe languages (in particular C and C++).
These kinds of errors often lead to disastrous security vulnerabilities,
such as
<a href="http://www.dwheeler.com/essays/heartbleed">Heartbleed</a>.
</p>
<p>
This kind of distribution option is absolutely not for everyone.
Address Sanitizer on average increases processing time by about 73%,
and memory usage by 340%.
What&#8217;s more, this work is currently very experimental,
and you have to disable some other security mechanisms to make it work.
That said, this effort has already borne a lot of valuable fruit.
Turning on these mechanisms across
an entire Linux distribution has revealed a large number of memory errors
that are getting fixed.
I can easily imagine this being directly useful in the future, too.
Computers are very fast and have lots of memory, even when compared
to computers of just a few years earlier.
There are definitely situations where it&#8217;s okay to effectively
halve performance and reduce <i>useful</i> memory, and in exchange,
significantly increase the system&#8217;s resistance to novel attack.
My congrats!!
