<p>
If you&#8217;re involved in a free / libre / open source software (FLOSS) project,
go to
<a href="https://bestpractices.coreinfrastructure.org/">bestpractices.coreinfrastructure.org</a>
and get your best practices badge!
</p>

<p>
The Linux Foundation&#8217;s Core Infrastructure Initiative (CII)
has just announced its CII best practices badging program
for FLOSS projects.
It&#8217;s a free program that lets developers explain how they
follow best practices, and if they do, they can get a badge
that they can show on their GitHub page or anywhere else.
Early badge earners include the Linux kernel, Curl, GitLab,
OpenBlox, OpenSSL, Node.js and Zephyr.
</p>

<p>
The idea is straightforward.
The Heartbleed vulnerability in OpenSSL made it obvious that
there are widely-accepted best practices that not everyone is doing -
and that even includes important projects.
This isn&#8217;t just speculation;
if you compare
<a href="https://bestpractices.coreinfrastructure.org/projects/87">OpenSSL
before Heartbleed</a> with
<a href="https://bestpractices.coreinfrastructure.org/projects/54">current
OpenSSL</a> the difference is striking.
I think it&#8217;s clear that if
more projects would apply generally-accepted best practices,
we&#8217;d have more secure software.
This badging process helps projects identify those best practices,
determine if they meet them, and show everyone else that they&#8217;re
meeting them.
</p>

<p>
<a href="https://github.com/linuxfoundation/cii-best-practices-badge">The
web application and criteria are being maintained
as an open source software project</a>, so we&#8217;d love to have you!
I say &#8220;we&#8221; because I&#8217;m leading this project&#8230; but it&#8217;s not just me,
and we would love to have you involved.
