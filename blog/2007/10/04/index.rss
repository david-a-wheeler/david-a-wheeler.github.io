Lots of interesting things are happening
with the various efforts to eliminate or counter software vulnerabilities.
The &lt;a href=&quot;http://iac.dtic.mil/iatac/download/security.pdf&quot;&gt;
Software Security Assurance (SwA) State-of-the-Art Report (SOAR)&lt;/a&gt;
tries to list what&amp;#8217;s going on, especially in things related to the
U.S. government.
As with any such document, it&amp;#8217;s incomplete, and it&amp;#8217;s only a snapshot
(things keep changing!).
But if you haven&amp;#8217;t been following this world, and want to know
&amp;#8220;what&amp;#8217;s going on&amp;#8221;, it&amp;#8217;s the best place I know of to start.
Of course, you can also look at sites such as the
&lt;a href=&quot;https://buildsecurityin.us-cert.gov/&quot;&gt;
U.S. DHS / CERT &amp;#8220;build security in&amp;#8221; site&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The &lt;a href=&quot;http://nvd.nist.gov/&quot;&gt;U.S. National Vulnerability Database&lt;/a&gt;
tracks specific vulnerabilities in specific products; they identify each
vulnerability using the unique id defined by &lt;a href=&quot;http://cve.mitre.org/&quot;&gt;
Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE)&lt;/a&gt;.
But if the world is going to prevent these kinds of
vulnerabilities from happening in the future, we need to categorize them
in a way that everyone agrees what the categories are.
Informally, there are lots of ways to categorize them, but their meanings
differ between people.
That&amp;#8217;s a real problem when comparing tools; different tools find different
problems, but without agreed-on terminology, it&amp;#8217;s hard to even describe
their differences.
MITRE is currently developing a way to categorize all vulnerabilities in
a way that everyone can agree on, called
&lt;a href=&quot;http://cwe.mitre.org/&quot;&gt;Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE)&lt;/a&gt;.
The U.S. National Vulnerability Database and MITRE have worked out a
&lt;a href=&quot;http://nvd.nist.gov/cwe.cfm&quot;&gt;set of CWEs that they will use to
categorize vulnerabilities&lt;/a&gt;.
The CWE is still being developed, but at least some common terminology
is getting worked out.
&lt;/p&gt;
