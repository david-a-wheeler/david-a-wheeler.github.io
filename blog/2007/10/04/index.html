Lots of interesting things are happening
with the various efforts to eliminate or counter software vulnerabilities.
The <a href="http://iac.dtic.mil/iatac/download/security.pdf">
Software Security Assurance (SwA) State-of-the-Art Report (SOAR)</a>
tries to list what&#8217;s going on, especially in things related to the
U.S. government.
As with any such document, it&#8217;s incomplete, and it&#8217;s only a snapshot
(things keep changing!).
But if you haven&#8217;t been following this world, and want to know
&#8220;what&#8217;s going on&#8221;, it&#8217;s the best place I know of to start.
Of course, you can also look at sites such as the
<a href="https://buildsecurityin.us-cert.gov/">
U.S. DHS / CERT &#8220;build security in&#8221; site</a>.

The <a href="http://nvd.nist.gov/">U.S. National Vulnerability Database</a>
tracks specific vulnerabilities in specific products; they identify each
vulnerability using the unique id defined by <a href="http://cve.mitre.org/">
Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE)</a>.
But if the world is going to prevent these kinds of
vulnerabilities from happening in the future, we need to categorize them
in a way that everyone agrees what the categories are.
Informally, there are lots of ways to categorize them, but their meanings
differ between people.
That&#8217;s a real problem when comparing tools; different tools find different
problems, but without agreed-on terminology, it&#8217;s hard to even describe
their differences.
MITRE is currently developing a way to categorize all vulnerabilities in
a way that everyone can agree on, called
<a href="http://cwe.mitre.org/">Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE)</a>.
The U.S. National Vulnerability Database and MITRE have worked out a
<a href="http://nvd.nist.gov/cwe.cfm">set of CWEs that they will use to
categorize vulnerabilities</a>.
The CWE is still being developed, but at least some common terminology
is getting worked out.
