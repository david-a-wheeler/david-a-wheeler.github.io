<p><a name="mapreduce"><font size="+2"><b>Added &#8220;MapReduce&#8221; to the &#8220;Software Innovations&#8221; list</b></font></a></p><p></p>
<p>
<a href="http://blog.krugle.com/?p=272">Ken Krugler&#8217;s recent blog</a>
said that my article of
<a href="http://www.dwheeler.com/innovation/innovation.html">
The Most Important Software Innovations</a> was &#8220;very good&#8221;, but he
was surprised that I hadn&#8217;t included
<a href="http://labs.google.com/papers/mapreduce.html">MapReduce</a>
as an important software innovation.
Basically, MapReduce makes writing certain kinds of
programs that process <i>huge</i> amounts of data, on vast distributed
clusters, remarkably easy and efficient.
(<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MapReduce">Wikipedia explains
MapReduce</a>, including links to alternative implementations like
the open source <a href="http://lucene.apache.org/hadoop/">Hadoop</a>.)
</p>
<p>
It&#8217;s not because I didn&#8217;t know about MapReduce;
I read about it almost immediately after it got published.
I thought it was <i>very</i> promising, and even forwarded the original
paper to some co-workers.
I think MapReduce is especially promising because, now that we have
cheap commodity computers, having a way to <i>easily</i> exploit their
capabilities is really valuable.
But even with something this promising, I didn&#8217;t want to add it to
my list of innovations right away - after all,
maybe after a little while it turns out to be not so helpful.
</p>
<p>
Currently, there&#8217;s aren&#8217;t many who have Google-sized clusters of computers
available.
But it&#8217;s clear that this approach is useful in many other circumstances
as well.
It&#8217;s new, but I think it&#8217;s stood the test of time enough that it&#8217;s
a worthy addition&#8230; so I&#8217;ve just added it.
</p>
<p>
One interesting issue is that the
MapReduce framework is itself built primarily on
the &#8220;map&#8221; and &#8220;reduce&#8221; functions, which are far, far older.
So, is MapReduce really a <i>new</i> idea,
or is it just a high-quality implementation of an old idea?
I&#8217;ll accept that it&#8217;s a new idea, but that can be difficult to judge.
This judgment doesn&#8217;t <i>really</i> matter unless you think
software patents are a good idea
(since every software patents in theory prevents progress for 20 years).
But I think it&#8217;s quite clear that software patents are a foolish idea,
and it&#8217;s clear that others have come to the same conclusion.
<a href="http://press.ffii.org/Press_releases/Economist_Critic_of_Software_Patents_gets_Nobel_Prize">
Eric S. Maskin, an economist who has long criticised the patenting
of software, recently received the 2007 Nobel Prize for Economics</a>.
Here&#8217;s a nice quote:
&#8220;&#8230; when patent protection was extended to software in the 1980s,
[&#8230;] standard arguments would predict that R&amp;D
intensity and productivity should have increased among patenting firms.
Consistent with our model, however, these increases did not occur.&#8221;
Someone who correctly predicted that software patents were harmful
to innovation just received a Nobel prize.
I hope to someday see people receive other prizes because they
ended software patenting in the United States.
