&lt;a href=&quot;http://oss-institute.org/Navy/DONCIO_OSS_User_Guidance.pdf&quot;&gt;
On June 5, 2007, the U.S.
Navy released some guidance on Open Source Software&lt;/a&gt;.
In particular, they noted that if
Open Source Software (OSS) met the U.S. law definition of &amp;#8220;commercial item&amp;#8221;,
it was a commercial item.
(They actually say OSS that meets that definition is
commercial off-the-shelf (COTS), not just a &amp;#8220;commercial item&amp;#8221; -
presumably because they had in mind the off-the-shelf
open source software.)
I&amp;#8217;m delighted to see this guidance, because
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dwheeler.com/essays/commercial-floss.html&quot;&gt;
I&amp;#8217;ve been saying the same thing&lt;/a&gt;.
This Navy memo was pretty clear, yet
some people seemed to have really odd interpretations of it.
In particular,
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gcn.com/print/26_14/44462-1.html?topic=defense-technology&amp;amp;CMP=OTC-RSS&quot;&gt;
GCN reported&lt;/a&gt; that
&amp;#8220;After several years of evaluation, the Navy Department has
approved the use of open-source software in all Navy and Marine Corps
information technology systems.&amp;#8221;
This GCN article
makes it seem like there&amp;#8217;s been some big change in direction,
and I think that&amp;#8217;s a terrible misunderstanding of what&amp;#8217;s going on here.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I believe this 2007 Navy memo is &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; a change in policy or direction.
This Navy memo merely tries to counter a widespread misunderstanding that is
sometimes resulting in a failure to obey U.S. law, the U.S. government&amp;#8217;s
Federal Acquisition Regulations (aka the FAR), and (by
implication) the U.S. Department of Defense&amp;#8217;s (DoD)
Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS).
This memo also serves as a restatement that
Navy policy continues to obey &lt;i&gt;existing&lt;/i&gt;
DoD and U.S. government policies
regarding open source software (OSS), as were already formally established in
2003-2004.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Below are some supporting details to justify those statements. I hope
they will help put this memo in context.
As is usual in any blog, my conclusions are just my own opinion,
not the official position of any organization.
On the other hand, I think I have really good evidence!
So let&amp;#8217;s see&amp;#8230;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Years ago some people had the strange idea that OSS was prohibited in
the DoD or U.S. federal government, even though there was no such
prohibition. This was particularly bizarre in the DoD, since a MITRE
report (final publication early 2003) found that OSS use was already
widespread and very helpful to the DoD.  That MITRE report concluded
that &amp;#8220;Neither the survey nor the analysis supports the premise that
banning or seriously restricting [Free / Open Source Software (FOSS)]
would benefit DoD security or defensive capabilities. To the contrary,
the combination of an ambiguous status and largely ungrounded fears that
it cannot be used with other types of software are keeping FOSS from
reaching optimal levels of use.&amp;#8221;:
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.terrybollinger.com/dodfoss/dodfoss_pdf_hyperlinked.pdf&quot;&gt;http://www.terrybollinger.com/dodfoss/dodfoss_pdf_hyperlinked.pdf&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
So in May 2003 an official DoD policy memo (&amp;#8220;OSS in DoD&amp;#8221;) was released.
It affirmed that OSS was fine as long as it met the applicable DoD
requirements, just as any other kind of software had to meet the
applicable DoD requirements:
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.egovos.org/rawmedia_repository/822a91d2_fc51_4e6e_8120_1c2d4d88fa06?/document.pdf&quot;&gt;http://www.egovos.org/rawmedia_repository/822a91d2_fc51_4e6e_8120_1c2d4d88fa06?/document.pdf&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
This problem was government-wide, so in July 2004, OMB released a
similar policy memo (M-04-16), which explicitly stated that U.S. federal
government acquisition policy was neutral about using OSS vs.
proprietary software. In particular, it said that government &amp;#8220;policies
are intentionally technology and vendor neutral, and to the maximum
extent practicable, agency implementation should be similarly neutral.&amp;#8221;:
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/memoranda/fy04/m04-16.html&quot;&gt;http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/memoranda/fy04/m04-16.html&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Yet there still seemed to be some strange misunderstandings, in spite of
these 2003 and 2004 policy memos explicitly stating that U.S. DoD and
federal acquisition policies were neutral on the question of using OSS
vs. proprietary software (they merely had to obey the usual
requirements). More recently, these misunderstandings seem to revolve
around a failure to read and understand the term &amp;#8220;commercial item&amp;#8221; as
defined by U.S. Code Title 41, Chapter 7, section 403, as well as its
corresponding FAR text. These define a &amp;#8220;commercial item&amp;#8221; as an item
&amp;#8220;customarily used by the general public or by non-governmental entities&amp;#8221;
(i.e., they have uses not unique to a government) and have been &amp;#8220;sold,
leased, or licensed to the general public&amp;#8221;). It would seem obvious that
if OSS meets the U.S. law/FAR definition for a commercial item, it is a
commercial item for government acquisition purposes.  And nearly all
extant OSS  does indeed meet this definition; nearly all extant OSS
has non-government uses and are licensed to the public.
In addition, almost all  already-existing OSS software also meets the definition
of commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS), since they are commercial items
that are ALREADY available to the public (&amp;#8220;off the shelf&amp;#8221;).
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The problem was that some acquisition programs were redefining the term
&amp;#8220;commercial item&amp;#8221; (and COTS) to exclude OSS competitors. These
redefinitions were in contradiction to the existing DoD and federal
government-wide explicit policy for neutrality regarding OSS, and in
contradiction to the clear definition of &amp;#8220;commercial item&amp;#8221; given in U.S.
law, the FAR, and by implication the DFARS. The Navy memo simply tries
to correct this misunderstanding, as well as re-iterating that the
existing DoD and federal government policy on OSS continues.  This Navy
memo was signed by Department of the Navy CIO Robert J. Carey on June 5,
2007, and titled &amp;#8220;Department of the Navy Open Source Software Guidance&amp;#8221;.
You can find the Navy memo here:
&lt;a href=&quot;http://oss-institute.org/Navy/DONCIO_OSS_User_Guidance.pdf&quot;&gt;http://oss-institute.org/Navy/DONCIO_OSS_User_Guidance.pdf&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The main implication of this definition of &amp;#8220;commercial item&amp;#8221; is that (as
required by law and the FAR) contractors and their subcontractors at all
tiers must do market research of the commercial market and consider ALL
their commercial options&amp;#8230; including the OSS options.   This is
certainly NOT a special preference for OSS, and ALL evaluation
characteristics for software are still valid (e.g., functionality, total
cost of ownership, quality, security, support, and flexibility). But in
cases where the OSS option is the better option, by policy the U.S.
government intends to take advantage of it.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
This approach makes sense, given the major changes that are happening
in the software industry.  In many market segments OSS programs are
the #1 or #2 product by market share, and OSS in aggregate now
represents billions of dollars of development effort.   Many
companies are developing OSS and/or selling commercial support
for OSS, including Red Hat, Novell, Sun Microsystems, IBM, and
MySQL AB.  Microsoft competes with some OSS programs, business models,
and licenses, but in other areas Microsoft uses, develops,
and encourages OSS (Microsoft&amp;#8217;s Windows includes
BSD-developed networking applications; Microsoft OSS projects include WiX and
IronPython; Microsoft runs the &amp;#8220;Codeplex&amp;#8221; website to encourage
OSS development on Windows).  In areas where they are appropriate
some major OSS programs have received the relevant Common Criteria
or FIPS 140-2 IT security certificates.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
OSS potentially affects how acquisition programs acquire software, but
acquisition programs should &lt;i&gt;expect&lt;/i&gt; to be affected by changes in relevant
commercial industries.  This was anticipated; the DoD policy memo
&amp;#8220;Commercial Acquisitions&amp;#8221; (Jan. 5, 2001) explains that the benefits of
commercial item acquisition include &amp;#8220;increased competition; use of
market and catalog prices; and access to leading edge technology and
&amp;#8216;non-traditional&amp;#8217; business segments&amp;#8221;.  In other words, DoD policy
anticipates that there WILL be &amp;#8220;non-traditional business segments&amp;#8221; - and
its policy is to embrace and exploit such changes where appropriate.
(Given its growth and breadth, it&amp;#8217;s become increasingly difficult to
argue that OSS is &amp;#8220;non-traditional&amp;#8221; anyway.)  AT&amp;L&amp;#8217;s &amp;#8220;Commercial Item
Handbook&amp;#8221; (November 2001) explains that this broad definition of
&amp;#8220;commercial item&amp;#8221; is intentional, because it &amp;#8220;enables the Government to
take greater advantage of the commercial marketplace.&amp;#8221; See:
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.acq.osd.mil/dpap/Docs/cihandbook.pdf&quot;&gt;http://www.acq.osd.mil/dpap/Docs/cihandbook.pdf&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
In other words, U.S. contractors must consider &lt;i&gt;all&lt;/i&gt; their options,
and then
select the best one.  They are &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; allowed to arbitrarily ignore a
relevant commercial industry sector, and are specifically &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; allowed to
ignore OSS options.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
If you&amp;#8217;re interested in this topic,
you might also be interested in some related articles of mine, such as
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dwheeler.com/essays/oss-government-acquisitions.html&quot;&gt;
Open Source Software (OSS) in U.S. Government Acquisitions&lt;/a&gt;
and
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dwheeler.com/essays/commercial-floss.html&quot;&gt;
“Commercial” is not the opposite of Free-Libre / Open Source Software (FLOSS):
Nearly all FLOSS is Commercial&lt;/a&gt;.

    <title>FLOSS License Slide - Released!</title>
    <link>http://www.dwheeler.com/blog/2007/07/11#floss-license-slide-2</link>
    <pubDate>Wed, 11 Jul 2007 23:17 GMT</pubDate>

    <description>
&lt;p&gt;
There are a large number of Free-Libre / Open Source Software (FLOSS)
licenses, but only a few are widely used.
Unsurprisingly, the widely-used licenses tend to be compatible &amp;#8212;
that is, it’s possible to combine software under the different licenses
to produce a larger work. But many people have trouble figuring out
when they can be combined, or how.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So I&amp;#8217;ve created a little figure which I call the “FLOSS license slide” to
make it easier to see if FLOSS licenses can be combined in many common
cases, and if so, what the basic ramifications are.
I&amp;#8217;ve crafted it so that the figure and explanatory text all fit in a page,
which can be handy.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
You can look at the FLOSS license slide in one of three formats:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dwheeler.com/essays/floss-license-slide.html&quot;&gt;HTML of &amp;#8220;FLOSS License Slide&amp;#8221;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dwheeler.com/essays/floss-license-slide.pdf&quot;&gt;PDF of &amp;#8220;FLOSS License Slide&amp;#8221;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dwheeler.com/essays/floss-license-slide.odt&quot;&gt;OpenDocument version of &amp;#8220;FLOSS License Slide&amp;#8221;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I had released a
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dwheeler.com/blog/2007/06/11/#floss-license-slide&quot;&gt;draft
of this earlier&lt;/a&gt;, and got some nice feedback.
I added &amp;#8220;public domain&amp;#8221;; there seemed to be enough questions about
public domain software that it made sense to add that to the figure.
Yes, I know that technically &amp;#8220;public domain&amp;#8221; isn&amp;#8217;t a license, but it&amp;#8217;s
much easier to understand and explain by treating it as if it were one.
Some of the earlier text was not clear enough; hopefully this one is clearer.
For example, GPLv2+ and the Affero GPL 3 licenses are compatible via GPLv3,
but some people had trouble understanding why. Now the text
notes that they are compatible via the GPL version 3,
which will hopefully make that clearer.
I also added the HTML format.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I&amp;#8217;m not a lawyer, and if you need formal legal advice you need to consult your
own attorney. But for many people, this is the information you needed,
in a conveniently small format, so here it is.
Enjoy!

    <title>Increasing Government Interest in Free-Libre / Open Source Software (FLOSS)</title>
    <link>http://www.dwheeler.com/blog/2007/07/08#government-oss-interest-2007</link>
    <pubDate>Sun, 08 Jul 2007 16:10 GMT</pubDate>

    <description>
&lt;p&gt;
There&amp;#8217;s more on the web now about governments and
Free-Libre / Open Source Software (FLOSS), both on my
own site and other sites.   I think this suggests more and more interest
by governments in FLOSS.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I&amp;#8217;ve now posted
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dwheeler.com/essays/oss-government-acquisitions.html&quot;&gt;
Open Source Software (OSS) in U.S. Government Acquisitions&lt;/a&gt;,
which is a slightly-updated version of my article which was published in the
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.softwaretechnews.com/stn_view.php?stn_id=42&quot;&gt;
&amp;#8220;DoD Software Tech News&amp;#8221; issue devoted to
free-libre / open source software (FLOSS)&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dwheeler.com/blog/2007/06/19#software-tech-magazine&quot;&gt;
As I noted earlier&lt;/a&gt;, this issue has lots of good articles.
I was asked to create the article (not the other way around), so I think
the very existance of this issue
is evidence of increasing interest, not just a personal interest of mine.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I should probably mention why I&amp;#8217;m posting a revision.
&lt;i&gt;After&lt;/i&gt; I submitted my article, the
&lt;a href=&quot;http://oss-institute.org/Navy/DONCIO_OSS_User_Guidance.pdf&quot;&gt;
Department of the Navy CIO Robert J. Carey signed a June 5, 2007 memorandum titled “Department of the Navy Open Source Software Guidance”&lt;/a&gt;
which notes that FLOSS needs to be considered a commercial item when it meets
the U.S. government&amp;#8217;s standard definition of a commercial item
(nearly all extant FLOSS does).
That is the same basic point that I raised in my presentation and paper,
and I would have gladly mentioned the Navy memo&amp;#8230; had it been released
at the time.  So my modified version now points to the Navy memo, as well
as making a few tweaks based on other feedback.
This realization that FLOSS programs are (almost always) commercial items
is an important point in the U.S. government.
Why?  Because
&lt;a href=&quot;http://enterprise.linux.com/enterprise/07/06/06/0135204.shtml&quot;&gt;
as noted in Linux.com&lt;/a&gt;, that means that extant FLOSS software must be
considered when the U.S. government acquires software the same way as
other commercial software is considered (i.e., it must be considered
&lt;i&gt;before&lt;/i&gt; starting a new project to write their own).
The Navy memo&amp;#8217;s assertion of this makes it worth posting an update.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
But think of this updated essay as a only sampler&amp;#8230;
for the rest of the articles,
you&amp;#8217;ll still need to go read the 
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.softwaretechnews.com/stn_view.php?stn_id=42&quot;&gt;
&amp;#8220;DoD Software Tech News&amp;#8221; issue&lt;/a&gt;.
Getting the issue does require registration, but registration is
free and in this case it&amp;#8217;s worthwhile.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Anyway, it&amp;#8217;s not just one issue about FLOSS in one magazine.
Here&amp;#8217;s more evidence it&amp;#8217;s not just me -
on July 5, 2007, the article
&lt;a href=&quot;http://robertogaloppini.net/2007/07/05/open-source-government-good-will-needed/&quot;&gt;Open Source Government: good-will needed&lt;/a&gt;
was posted by
&lt;a href=&quot;http://robertogaloppini.net/&quot;&gt;
Roberto Galoppini&amp;#8217;s Commercial Open Source Software blog&lt;/a&gt;.
He points in turn to various articles, including
&lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.cnet.com/8301-13505_1-9739745-16.html?part=rss&amp;amp;subj=TheOpenRoad&quot;&gt;
Matt Asay&amp;#8217;s &amp;#8220;Open source in government: Leadership needed&amp;#8221;&lt;/a&gt;,
which then leads you back to a very interesting research paper:
&lt;a href=&quot;http://oss-institute.org/whitepapers/NCDG_Hamel_07-004.pdf&quot;&gt;
&amp;#8220;Open-Source Collaboration in the Public Sector: The Need for Leadership
and Value&amp;#8221;&lt;/a&gt; by Michael P. Hamel.
There&amp;#8217;s lots of interesting discussion in those articles
about how governments can use FLOSS, and
in particular how governments can use FLOSS components and approaches
more effectively.
I&amp;#8217;ll throw in my own two cents here.  I would certainly agree that
leadership is important in any project, including FLOSS projects;
the leadership of Linus Torvalds of the Linux kernel is well-documented,
for example.
But there are different kinds and levels of leadership.
Roberto Galoppini says,
&amp;#8220;I think that first we need politicians with good-will, willing to put their
intellectual potential to work for the overall desires of the
general public&amp;#8230;&amp;#8221;; while that&amp;#8217;s good, often what&amp;#8217;s important is the
ability to lead &lt;i&gt;concept&lt;/i&gt; into &lt;i&gt;practice&lt;/i&gt;.
It&amp;#8217;s easy to &amp;#8220;lead&amp;#8221; by saying words, but I think that
often what&amp;#8217;s needed is the kind of leadership that rolls up its sleeves and
makes actual projects produce useful results.
Focusing on specific, measurable products can often get better results.
Certainly politicians with goodwill are a good thing, but they can provide
value primarily by providing &amp;#8220;cover&amp;#8221; for those who actually do the
hands-on leading of projects, but the latter make or break such efforts.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
While I can quibble with some of the stuff Hamel says, some of the
his statements seem dead-on with what I see.
Hamel notes that &amp;#8220;participants
in both groups also believe that the creation of value, or products
that are appropriate and effective in addressing
members’ wants and needs, is critical&amp;#8221;&amp;#8230; to which I say, Amen.
Hamel concludes that
&amp;#8220;Collaborations with a strong leadership structure, and more
importantly a single leader
who is persistent, passionate and willing to spend a great deal of time
maintaining and improving
the organization are much more likely to succeed. Value is also a critical
component, and
requires that efforts meet the wants and needs of members and clients, whether
they be in the
form of software, documentation, research or even policy advocacy.&amp;#8221;
Focusing on a few most useful projects is critical:
&amp;#8220;a conscious effort to focus energy on a small
number of projects in early stages may be an important component in creating
value for members of collaborative efforts.&amp;#8221;
A FLOSS project requires collaboration to be successful, and collaboration
requires that the project gain the trust of potential users/developers;
&amp;#8220;In this research I found that leadership, face-to-face contact, and
the legal framework were the primary factors leading to trust.
A willingness and ability to evolve, which may be tied
to creating products of value to clients and members, might also be an
important factor in developing a successful collaboration.&amp;#8221;
Those statements, at least, seem very sound.
These aren&amp;#8217;t new ideas, to be sure, but it sure is easy to lose sight of them.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I think there&amp;#8217;s a vast opportunity here for governments to use FLOSS.
Which is odd in a sense, because in fact, FLOSS is already widely used
in governments. MITRE determined back in 2003 that FLOSS was already
critically important to the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD).
But that widespread use is small compared to its potential, and to how
many commercial organizations use FLOSS, and there are a lot of
reasons for that.
Governments have long aquisition times, often tend to avoid doing anything
&amp;#8220;risky&amp;#8221; (aka &amp;#8220;different than the way we did it before&amp;#8221;, abetted because
there&amp;#8217;s no competitor to force them to improve),
and many proprietary
vendors target governments to try to prevent them from using competing
FLOSS products.
Which means that even when it makes sense to use FLOSS,
it can often take much longer for FLOSS components and approaches to
enter into government use.
But it has already entered into significant use, and I expect that
to accelerate over the years.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
There are some other goodies on my web site if you&amp;#8217;re interested in
this topic (government and FLOSS).
My essay is basically a text version of my
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dwheeler.com/essays/oss_200703.pdf&quot;&gt;March 2007
presentation on Free-libre / Open Source Software (FLOSS)&lt;/a&gt;.
It includes snippets from much longer papers that
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dwheeler.com/oss_fs_why.html&quot;&gt;give statistics about FLOSS&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dwheeler.com/oss_fs_eval.html&quot;&gt;explain how to
evaluate FLOSS&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dwheeler.com/essays/high-assurance-floss.html&quot;&gt;
discuss FLOSS and security&lt;/a&gt;, and
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dwheeler.com/essays/commercial-floss.html&quot;&gt;
explain why most FLOSS is commercial software&lt;/a&gt;.
There&amp;#8217;s even a hint of my essay
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dwheeler.com/essays/gpl-compatible.html&quot;&gt;
Make Your Open Source Software GPL-Compatible. Or Else&lt;/a&gt;, since
I note the widespread use of the GPL.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Again, if you have a true &lt;a href=&quot;http://lifehacker.com/software/office-culture/dealing-with-clueless-supervisors-128768.php&quot;&gt;PHB&lt;/a&gt;, I can&amp;#8217;t help you.
But many managers are trying to the right thing, and just need reasonable
information so that they &lt;i&gt;can&lt;/i&gt; do the right thing.
&lt;/p&gt;
