The U.S. Department of Defense (DoD)&amp;#8217;s software technology magazine
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.softwaretechnews.com/stn_view.php?stn_id=42&quot;&gt;
&amp;#8220;DoD Software Tech News&amp;#8221; has posted a
whole issue devoted to free-libre / open source software (FLOSS)&lt;/a&gt;.
If you&amp;#8217;re trying to get FLOSS seriously considered by acquisition or
management people, this may be what you need.
This issue includes essays by David A. Wheeler (that&amp;#8217;s me!),
Terry Bollinger, John M. Weathersby, Mark Lucas (on Geospatial FLOSS),
Peter Gallagher, Matt Asay (Alfresco), and Andrew Gordon.
Free registration required. 
My essay is basically a text version of my
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dwheeler.com/essays/oss_200703.pdf&quot;&gt;March 2007
presentation on Free-libre / Open Source Software (FLOSS)&lt;/a&gt;;
it includes snippets from my papers that
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dwheeler.com/oss_fs_why.html&quot;&gt;give statistics about FLOSS&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dwheeler.com/oss_fs_eval.html&quot;&gt;explain how to
evaluate FLOSS&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dwheeler.com/essays/high-assurance-floss.html&quot;&gt;
discuss FLOSS and security&lt;/a&gt;, and
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dwheeler.com/essays/commercial-floss.html&quot;&gt;
explain why most FLOSS is commercial software&lt;/a&gt;.
There&amp;#8217;s even a hint of my essay
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dwheeler.com/essays/gpl-compatible.html&quot;&gt;
Make Your Open Source Software GPL-Compatible. Or Else&lt;/a&gt;, since
I note the widespread use of the GPL.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
After I submitted my article, but before it got published, the
&lt;a href=&quot;http://oss-institute.org/Navy/DONCIO_OSS_User_Guidance.pdf&quot;&gt;
Department of the Navy CIO Robert J. Carey signed a June 5, 2007 memorandum titled “Department of the Navy Open Source Software Guidance”&lt;/a&gt;
which notes that FLOSS needs to be considered a commercial item when it meets
the U.S. government&amp;#8217;s standard definition of a commercial item
(and nearly all extant FLOSS meets that definition).
That is the same basic point that I raised in my presentation.
It feels nice to have made a key statement, and then find that the
U.S. Navy officially confirms it.
&lt;a href=&quot;http://enterprise.linux.com/enterprise/07/06/06/0135204.shtml&quot;&gt;
As noted in Linux.com&lt;/a&gt;, that means that extant FLOSS software must be
considered when the U.S. government acquires software, the same way as
other commercial software is considered (i.e., it must be considered
&lt;i&gt;before&lt;/i&gt; starting a new project to write their own).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If you have a true &lt;a href=&quot;http://lifehacker.com/software/office-culture/dealing-with-clueless-supervisors-128768.php&quot;&gt;PHB&lt;/a&gt;, I can&amp;#8217;t help you.
But many managers just need some honest information, and this is at least one
way to get it to them.
&lt;/p&gt;
