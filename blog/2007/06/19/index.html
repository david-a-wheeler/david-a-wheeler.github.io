The U.S. Department of Defense (DoD)&#8217;s software technology magazine
<a href="https://www.softwaretechnews.com/stn_view.php?stn_id=42">
&#8220;DoD Software Tech News&#8221; has posted a
whole issue devoted to free-libre / open source software (FLOSS)</a>.
If you&#8217;re trying to get FLOSS seriously considered by acquisition or
management people, this may be what you need.
This issue includes essays by David A. Wheeler (that&#8217;s me!),
Terry Bollinger, John M. Weathersby, Mark Lucas (on Geospatial FLOSS),
Peter Gallagher, Matt Asay (Alfresco), and Andrew Gordon.
Free registration required. 
My essay is basically a text version of my
<a href="http://www.dwheeler.com/essays/oss_200703.pdf">March 2007
presentation on Free-libre / Open Source Software (FLOSS)</a>;
it includes snippets from my papers that
<a href="http://www.dwheeler.com/oss_fs_why.html">give statistics about FLOSS</a>,
<a href="http://www.dwheeler.com/oss_fs_eval.html">explain how to
evaluate FLOSS</a>,
<a href="http://www.dwheeler.com/essays/high-assurance-floss.html">
discuss FLOSS and security</a>, and
<a href="http://www.dwheeler.com/essays/commercial-floss.html">
explain why most FLOSS is commercial software</a>.
There&#8217;s even a hint of my essay
<a href="http://www.dwheeler.com/essays/gpl-compatible.html">
Make Your Open Source Software GPL-Compatible. Or Else</a>, since
I note the widespread use of the GPL.

After I submitted my article, but before it got published, the
<a href="http://oss-institute.org/Navy/DONCIO_OSS_User_Guidance.pdf">
Department of the Navy CIO Robert J. Carey signed a June 5, 2007 memorandum titled “Department of the Navy Open Source Software Guidance”</a>
which notes that FLOSS needs to be considered a commercial item when it meets
the U.S. government&#8217;s standard definition of a commercial item
(and nearly all extant FLOSS meets that definition).
That is the same basic point that I raised in my presentation.
It feels nice to have made a key statement, and then find that the
U.S. Navy officially confirms it.
<a href="http://enterprise.linux.com/enterprise/07/06/06/0135204.shtml">
As noted in Linux.com</a>, that means that extant FLOSS software must be
considered when the U.S. government acquires software, the same way as
other commercial software is considered (i.e., it must be considered
<i>before</i> starting a new project to write their own).

If you have a true <a href="http://lifehacker.com/software/office-culture/dealing-with-clueless-supervisors-128768.php">PHB</a>, I can&#8217;t help you.
But many managers just need some honest information, and this is at least one
way to get it to them.
