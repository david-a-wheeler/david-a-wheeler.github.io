<p><a name="microsoft-linux-author"><font size="+2"><b>Microsoft, co-author of the Linux kernel</b></font></a></p><p></p>
<p>
Truth is often stranger than fiction.
<a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/450891/">
Microsoft was the fifth-largest corporate contributor
to the Linux kernel version 3.0.0</a>,
as measured by the number of changes to its previous release.
Only Red Hat, Intel, Novell, and IBM had more contributions.
Microsoft was #15 as measured by number of
lines changed, which is smaller but is still an impressively large number.
</p>
<p>
This work by Microsoft was to clean up
the &#8220;Microsoft Hyper-V (HV) driver&#8221;
so that the Microsoft driver would be included in the mainline Linux kernel.
Microsoft originally submitted this set of code changes
back in July 2009, but there were a lot of problems with it, and
the Linux kernel developers insisted that it be fixed.
<a href="http://www.networkworld.com/news/2009/091009-linux-chief-microsoft.html">The Linux community had a long list of issues
with Microsoft&#8217;s code</a>,
but the good news is that Microsoft worked to improve
the quality of its code so that it could be accepted into the Linux kernel.
Other developers helped Microsoft get their code up to par, too.
(<a href="http://www.unixwiz.net/techtips/review-hv-patches.html">
Steve Friedl has some comments about its early technical issues</a>.)
There&#8217;s something rather amusing about watching Microsoft
(a company that focuses on software development) being forced by
the Linux community to improve the quality of Microsoft&#8217;s code.
Anyone who thinks that FLOSS projects (which typically use widespread
public peer review) always produce lower quality software
than proprietary vendors just isn&#8217;t watching the real world
(<a href="http://www.dwheeler.com/oss_fs_why.html">see my survey paper of
quantitative FLOSS studies if you want more on that point</a>).
Peer review often exposes problems, so that they can be fixed,
and that is what happened here.
</p>
<p>
Microsoft did not do this for the sheer thrill of it.
Getting code into the mainline Linux kernel release,
instead of just existing as a separate patch, is vitally important for
an organization if they want people to <i>use</i> their software
(if it needs to be part of the Linux kernel, as this did).
A counter-example is that the
<a href="http://www.h-online.com/open/features/Xen-lets-KVM-overtake-1262171.html">Xen developers let KVM zoom ahead of them,
because the Xen developers failed to set a high priority on getting
full support for Xen into the mainline Linux kernel</a>.
As Thorsten Leemhuis at The H says,
&#8220;There are many indications that the Xen developers should have put more
effort into merging Xen support into the official kernel earlier. After
all, while Xen was giving developers and distribution users a hard time
with the old kernel, a new virtualisation star was rising on the open
source horizon: KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine)&#8230;  In the beginning,
KVM could not touch the functional scope and speed of Xen.
But soon, open source developers, Linux distributors,
and companies such as AMD, Intel
and IBM became interested in KVM and contributed a number of improvements,
so that KVM quickly caught up and even moved past Xen in some respects.&#8221;
<a href="http://virtualization.sys-con.com/node/1900898">Xen may
do well in the future</a>, but this is still a cautionary tale.
</p>
<p>
This doesn&#8217;t mean that Microsoft is suddenly releasing
all its programs as free/libre/open source software (FLOSS).
Far from it.
It is obvious to me that Microsoft is contributing this code
for the same reason many companies contribute
to the Linux kernel and other FLOSS software projects: Money.
</p>
<p>
I think it is clear that
Microsoft hopes that these changes to Linux will help
Microsoft sell more Windows licenses.
These changes enable Linux to run much better (e.g., more efficiently)
on top of Microsoft Windows&#8217; hypervisor (Hyper-V).
Without them, people who want to run Linux on top of a hypervisor are
much more likely to use products other than Microsoft&#8217;s.
Microsoft doesn&#8217;t want to be at a
competitive disadvantage in this market,
so to sell its product, it chose to contribute changes to the Linux kernel.
With this change, Microsoft Windows becomes a more viable option
as a host operating system, running Linux as a guest.
</p>
<p>
Is this a big change?
In some ways it is not.
<a href="http://www.dwheeler.com/oss_fs_why.html#anti-microsoft">
Microsoft has developed a number of FLOSS packages,
such as WiX (for installing software on Windows), and it does
all it can to encourage the development of FLOSS that run on Windows</a>.
</p>
<p>
Still, it&#8217;s something of a change for Microsoft.
<a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2001/06/02/ballmer_linux_is_a_cancer/">
Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer stated in 2001 that Linux and the
GNU GPL license were &#8220;a cancer&#8221;</a>.
This was in many ways an attack on FLOSS in general; the
<a href="http://www.dwheeler.com/essays/gpl-compatible.html">GNU GPL
is the most popular FLOSS license by far</a>, and a
<a href="http://www.terrybollinger.com/index.html#dodfoss">MITRE report</a>
found that the &#8220;GPL sufficiently dominates in DoD applications
for a ban on GPL to closely approximate a full ban of all [FLOSS]&#8221;.
This would have been disastrous for their customer, because MITRE found
that FLOSS software
&#8220;plays a far more critical role in the [Department of Defense]
than has been generally recognized&#8221;.
I think many other organizations would say the same.
This is not even the first time Microsoft has gotten involved with
the GPL.
Microsoft sold Windows Services for Unix (SFU), which had GPL software,
showing that even Microsoft understood that it was possible to make
money while using the GPL license.
But this more case is far more extreme; in this case Microsoft
is actively helping a product (the Linux kernel) that it also competes with.
I don&#8217;t expect Microsoft to keep contributing significantly to the
Linux kernel, at least for a while, but that doesn&#8217;t matter;
here we see that cash trumps ideology.
More generally, this beautifully illustrates collaborative development:
Anyone can choose to work on specific areas of a FLOSS program,
for their own specific or selfish reasons,
to co-produce works that help us all.

<p><a name="us-government-balance-budget"><font size="+2"><b>U.S. government must balance its budget</b></font></a></p><p></p>
<p>
<!-- meta-markup: Markdown -->
(This is a blog entry for U.S. citizens &mdash; everyone else can ignore it.)
</p>

<p>
We Americans must <b>demand</b> that the U.S. government
work to balance its budget over time.
The U.S. government has a massive annual deficit, resulting
in a massive national debt that is growing beyond all reasonable bounds.
For example, in just
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_federal_budget">Fiscal Year (FY) 2010</a>,
about $3.4 trillion was spent, but only
$2.1 trillion was received; that means that the U.S. government spent
more than a trillion dollars more than it received.
Every year that the government spends more than it receives it adds to the
<a href="http://www.pgpf.org/Special-Topics/The-Federal-Budget-Primer.aspx">gross federal debt, which is now more than $13.6 trillion</a>.
</p>

<p>
This is unsustainable.
The fact that this is unsustainable is certainly not news. The
<a href="http://www.gao.gov/cghome/d08446cg.pdf">U.S. Financial Condition and Fiscal Future Briefing (GAO, 2008)</a>
says, bluntly, that the &#8220;Current Fiscal Policy Is Unsustainable&#8221;.
<a href="http://www.fiscalcommission.gov/sites/fiscalcommission.gov/files/documents/TheMomentofTruth12_1_2010.pdf">
&#8220;The Moment of Truth:
Report of the National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform&#8221;</a>
similarly says
&#8220;Our nation is on an unsustainable fiscal path&#8221;.
Many others have said the same.
But even though it&#8217;s not news, it needs to be yelled from the rooftops.
</p>

<p>
The fundamental problem is that too many Americans &mdash; aka &#8220;we the people&#8221; &mdash;
have not (so far) been willing to face this unpleasant fact.
<a href="http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/1002/21/fzgps.01.html">Fareed Zakaria nicely put this in February 21, 2010</a>:
&#8220; &#8230; in one sense, Washington is delivering to the American people exactly what they seem to want. In poll after poll, we find that the public is generally opposed to any new taxes, but we also discover that the public will immediately punish anyone who proposes spending cuts in any middle class program which are the ones where the money is in the federal budget.
Now, there is only one way to square this circle short of magic, and that is to borrow money, and that is what we have done for decades now at the local, state and federal level &#8230;
The lesson of the polls in the recent elections is that politicians will succeed if they pander to this public schizophrenia. So, the next time you accuse Washington of being irresponsible, save some of that blame for yourself and your friends&#8221;.
</p>

<p>
But Americans must face the fact that we must balance the budget.
And we must face it now.
We must balance the budget the same way families balance
their budgets &mdash; the government must raise income (taxes), lower
expenditures (government spending), or both.
Growth over time will not fix the problem.
</p>

<p>
How we rellocate income and outgo so that they match
needs to be a political process.
Working out compromises is what the political
process is supposed to be all about;
nobody gets everything they want, but eventually some sort of rough
set of priorities must be worked out for the resources available.
Compromise is not a dirty word to describe the job of politics;
it <b>is</b> the job.
In reality, I think we will need to both raise revenue and decrease spending.
I think we must raise taxes to some small degree,
but we can&#8217;t raise taxes on the lower or middle
class much; they don&#8217;t have the money.
Also, we will not be able to solve this by taxing the rich out of the country.
Which means that we <b>must</b> cut spending somehow.
Just cutting defense spending won&#8217;t work;
defense is only 20% of the entire budget.
In contrast, the so-called entitlements &mdash; mainly
medicare, medicaid, and social security &mdash; are 43% of the
government costs and rapidly growing in cost.
I think we are going to have to lower entitlement spending;
that is undesirable, but we can&#8217;t keep providing services
we can&#8217;t pay for.
The alternative is to dramatically increase taxes to pay for them, and
I do not think that will work.
Raising the age before Social Security benefits can
normally be received is to me an obvious baby step, but again,
that alone will not solve the problem.
It&#8217;s clearly possible to hammer out approaches to
make this work, as long as the various camps are willing to work out
a compromise.
</p>

<p>
To get there, we need to specify and plan out the maximum debt that the
U.S. will incur in each year, decreasing that each year
(say, over a 10-year period).
Then Congress (and the President) will need to work out, each year,
how to meet that requirement.
It doesn&#8217;t need to be any of the plans that have been put
forward so far; there are lots of ways to do this.
But unless we agree that we must live within our means, we will not
be able to make the decisions necessary to do so.
The U.S. is not a Greece, at least not now, but we must make decisions
soon to prevent bad results.
I am posting this on Independence Day; Americans have been willing to
undergo lots of suffering to gain control over their destinies, and I
think they are still able to do so today.
</p>

<p>
In the short term (say a year),
I suspect we will need to focus on short-term
recovery rather than balancing the budget.
And we must <b>not</b> default.
But we must set the plans in motion to stop the runaway deficit,
and get that budget balanced.
The only way to get there is for the citizenry to demand it stop,
before far worse things happen.
