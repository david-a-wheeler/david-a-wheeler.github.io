Hooray!
<a href="http://lists.oasis-open.org/archives/tc-announce/201109/msg00010.html">Open Document Format for Office Applications (ODF or OpenDocument) Version 1.2 has been approved as an OASIS Standard</a>.
Finally, the world has a standard vendor-independent format for
storing and exchanging ordinary office documents
(particularly word processing documents, spreadsheets, and presentations)
that you can edit.
</p>
<p>
Historically, 
people have only been able to exchange these documents if they
use the same program, locking users into specific vendor products.
In short, users often don&#8217;t really own the documents they create; they
are often beholden to the developers of their tools.
This is especially nasty for government documents; all governments have
to choose <i>some</i> product, and whatever product they use implicitly
forces their citizens to use the same product (whether they want to or not).
Over time these documents can no longer be read, as products are upgraded
or people change products, so this is also a disaster for archiving.
We can read the Magna Carta more easily than some documents saved 30 years ago.
Heck, we can read Sumerian writings more easily than some documents
saved 30 years ago, and that is a scary thing.
ODF provides us the possibility of actually exchanging documents,
and reading archives, regardless of what program was used to create them.
In short, people now have real freedom when they
create and exchange normal office documents &mdash; they are no
longer locked into a particular supplier or version of program.

<a href="http://www.robweir.com/blog/2011/09/odf12-approved.html">Rob Weir has some of the highlights of version 1.2</a>, and he has also written
<a href="http://www.robweir.com/blog/publications/IEEE-Weir.pdf">an
overview of ODF</a>.
</p>
<p>
For me, the highlight is OpenFormula.
Previous versions of the specification could exchange spreadsheets, but
did not standardize the format of recalculated formulas.
I led the subcommittee in the ODF Technical Committee
to nail down exactly how to recalculate formulas.
The result: We now have a real spec.
My sincere thanks to the many who helped make this possible.

I&#8217;m sure that there will continue to be refinements for years to come;
that is normal for a standard.
In some sense this is after the fact; like many good standards, it was
developed through the cooperation of many of the implementors.
It is already implemented, at least in part, in many places, and I expect
even more completed implementations soon.
</p>
<p>
The key, though, is that users can finally own the documents they create.
That is a major step forward, for all of us.
