Asking
&amp;#8220;who has the copyright?&amp;#8221; for
&lt;a href=&quot;intellectual-rights-not-intellectual-property.html&quot;&gt;intellectual works&lt;/a&gt;
(like software, documents, and data) is almost always
the &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;wrong&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt; question to ask.
Instead, ask &amp;#8220;&lt;i&gt;what rights do I have (or can I get)?&lt;/i&gt;&amp;#8221; and
&amp;#8220;&lt;i&gt;do those rights let me do what I want to do?&lt;/i&gt;&amp;#8221;.
In a vast number of situations, those are the right questions to ask instead.
Even people who should know better can fall into this subtle trap!
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
This became obvious to me when it was revealed that even the smart
people at the Apache Software Foundation fell into this.
In the recent
&lt;a href=&quot;https://wiki.apache.org/incubator/AccumuloProposal&quot;&gt;Accumulo
proposal&lt;/a&gt;, there were unnecessary copyright hurdles because
Apache was unnecessarily asking for a copyright transfer, instead of
the necessary rights (in this case, there was no copyright to transfer!).
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
So I&amp;#8217;ve justed posted
&lt;i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dwheeler.com/essays/ask-not-holds-copyright.html&quot;&gt;Ask Not Who Holds the Copyright&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;,
which I hope will clear this up.
&lt;/p&gt;
