<p>
Asking
&#8220;who has the copyright?&#8221; for
<a href="intellectual-rights-not-intellectual-property.html">intellectual works</a>
(like software, documents, and data) is almost always
the <i><b>wrong</b></i> question to ask.
Instead, ask &#8220;<i>what rights do I have (or can I get)?</i>&#8221; and
&#8220;<i>do those rights let me do what I want to do?</i>&#8221;.
In a vast number of situations, those are the right questions to ask instead.
Even people who should know better can fall into this subtle trap!
</p>

<p>
This became obvious to me when it was revealed that even the smart
people at the Apache Software Foundation fell into this.
In the recent
<a href="https://wiki.apache.org/incubator/AccumuloProposal">Accumulo
proposal</a>, there were unnecessary copyright hurdles because
Apache was unnecessarily asking for a copyright transfer, instead of
the necessary rights (in this case, there was no copyright to transfer!).
</p>

<p>
So I&#8217;ve justed posted
<i><a href="http://www.dwheeler.com/essays/ask-not-holds-copyright.html">Ask Not Who Holds the Copyright</a></i>,
which I hope will clear this up.
