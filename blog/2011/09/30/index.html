<p>
I encourage all US citizens to sign
<a href="https://wwws.whitehouse.gov/petition-tool/petition/direct-patent-office-cease-issuing-software-patents/vvNslSTq">this petition to the US White House
to &#8220;direct the patent office to cease issuing software patents&#8221;</a>.
I believe
<a href="http://www.dwheeler.com/essays/software-patents.html">software
patents impede innovation (instead of helping it), and they
have become a threat to the US economy</a>.
Many organizations involved in software
are now spending lots of time fending off patent trolls,
fighting patent lawsuits, or cannot safely solve problems
due to patent thickets.
The recently-passed
&#8220;America Invents Act&#8221; (AIA) completely failed to deal with this
fundamental problem.
</p>
<p>
Signing a petition won&#8217;t immediately solve anything.
That&#8217;s not how it works.
But repeatedly making the government aware that there&#8217;s a real
problem is a good first step to solving a problem.
In the US,
<a href="https://wwws.whitehouse.gov/petitions/#!/how-why/introduction">the
right of the people to petition their government is guaranteed by
the first amendment of the US Constitution</a>
(&#8220;Congress shall make no law &#8230;. abridging&#8230; the right of the people
peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government
for a redress of grievances&#8221;).</a>
Everyone is affected today by software, and so far the government
has not effectively dealt with the problem.
Please use this opportunity to make the government aware of a real problem.
