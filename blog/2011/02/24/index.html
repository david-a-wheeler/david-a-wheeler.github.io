The
<a href="https://softwaretechnews.thedacs.com/stn_view.php?stn_id=56">January 2011 issue of the &#8220;DACS Software Tech News&#8221; (Volume 14 Number 1)</a> is finally available!
The entire issue is dedicated to covering the relationship of the
U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) and open source software (OSS).
If you&#8217;re interested in the DoD and software,
the U.S. government and software,
or open source software, you really need to look at this.
Even if you&#8217;re not a U.S. citizen, you&#8217;re probably influenced by
the decisions of the U.S. government
(it spends a lot of money on software!), and the experiences and lessons it
learns are probably useful in many other places.
You have to register (sorry!), but it&#8217;s well worth it.
</p>
<p>
I wrote or co-wrote several of the articles, so please let me point out
a couple of interesting points in them.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Software is a Renewable Military Resource&#8221; 
notes that it&#8217;s possible for projects inside the government to
use collaborative development approaches, even if the software
isn&#8217;t released to the public;
we call these &#8220;Open Government Off-the-shelf&#8221; (OGOTS)
projects.
Another term used for these projects is
Government Off-the-Shelf (GOSS);
people I respect use the term &#8220;GOSS&#8221;, but
I worry that the GOSS term is confusing (GOSS isn&#8217;t OSS,
because GOSS projects don&#8217;t allow arbitrary use and redistribution).
In the DoD, a related term is &#8220;Open Technology Development&#8221; (OTD),
which describes a community-based development process, be it
OGOTS or OSS with community-based maintenance.
The article has a nice little graphic that I think makes this
pretty clear.
</p>
<p>
My article
&#8220;Open Source Software Is Commercial&#8221;
won&#8217;t surprise anyone who&#8217;s seen my already-posted article
<a href="http://www.dwheeler.com/essays/commercial-floss.html">Free-Libre / Open Source Software (FLOSS) is Commercial Software</a>.
Basically, OSS is commercial software.
Anyone who says nonsense phrases like &#8220;commercial or open source software&#8221;
probably doesn&#8217;t understand open source software,
and is unlikely to make good decisions about software.
This new article focuses more on the formal legal definitions.
</p>
<p>
My article
&#8220;Publicly Releasing Open Source Software Developed for the U.S. Government&#8221;
summarizes
&#8220;when the U.S. federal
government or its contractors may publicly release, as
open source software (OSS), software developed with
government funds&#8221;.
If you ever interact with the U.S. federal government or its
contractors in software issues, make sure they get a copy of this article.
It&#8217;s easy to say &#8220;follow the rules&#8221; and &#8220;obey the contract&#8221;
but it&#8217;s often impossible to find out what the rules
and contracts <i>actually say</i>.
Even many lawyers didn&#8217;t know the information in this article,
and this is the kind of information that many <i>non-lawyers</i> need to know.
All too often the government and its contractors should be releasing
software as OSS, but don&#8217;t know that they have the right to do so.
It&#8217;s taken me years to pull together this information.
The article gives 5 basic questions that you need to answer.
One of those questions &mdash;
&#8220;Do you have the necessary copyright-related rights?&#8221; &mdash;
has a supporting table that I&#8217;m really happy with.
That table manages to take a lot of complicated legal
mumbo jumbo and turn it into something that can be actually understood.
One point this article brings home is that using the term
&#8220;intellectual property&#8221; is grossly misleading;
in government contracting (and in many other circumstances)
it usually doesn&#8217;t matter who holds the copyright;
what matters is who has what rights.
Anyway, if you need this information, you need this article.

Anyway, here&#8217;s the full list of articles in this issue:

Full disclosure: I&#8217;m on the DACS Software Tech News board
(as a volunteer; nobody pays me).
But the issue is good anyway :-).
