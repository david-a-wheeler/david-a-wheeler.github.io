&lt;p&gt;
A number of people have recently been discussing or referring to
my PhD work,
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dwheeler.com/trusting-trust/&quot;&gt;&amp;#8220;Fully Countering Trusting Trust through Diverse Double-Compiling (DDC)&amp;#8221;&lt;/a&gt;,
which
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dwheeler.com/trusting-trust/&quot;&gt;counters Trojan Horse attacks on compilers&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/1m4mwn/a_simple_way_of_defeating_the_compiler_backdoor/&quot;&gt;Last week&amp;#8217;s discussion on reddit&lt;/a&gt;
based on a short
&lt;a href=&quot;http://imgur.com/a/BWbnU#0&quot;&gt;short slide show&lt;/a&gt;
discussed it directly, for example.
There have also been related discussions such as
&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.torproject.org/blog/deterministic-builds-part-one-cyberwar-and-global-compromise&quot;&gt;Tor&amp;#8217;s work on creating deterministic builds&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
For everyone who&amp;#8217;s interested in DDC&amp;#8230; welcome!
I intentionally posted my dissertation, and a video about it,
directly on the Internet with no paywall.
That way, anyone who wants the information can immediately get it.
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dwheeler.com/trusting-trust/&quot;&gt;Enjoy!&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I even include enough background material
so other people
can independently repeat my experiments and verify my claims.
I believe that
if you cannot reproduce the results, it is not science&amp;#8230;
and a lot of computational research has stopped being a science.
This is not a new observation;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://academiccommons.columbia.edu/catalog/ac:140124&quot;&gt;&amp;#8220;Reproducible Research: Addressing the Need for Data and Code Sharing in Computational Science&amp;#8221; by Victoria C. Stodden (Computing in Science &amp;amp; Engineering, 2010)&lt;/a&gt; summarizes a roundtable on
this very problem.
The roadtable found that
&amp;#8220;Progress in computational science
is often hampered by researchers&amp;#8217;
inability to independently
reproduce or verify published results&amp;#8221;
and, along with a number of specific steps,
&amp;#8220;reproducibility must be embraced
at the cultural level within the
computational science community.&amp;#8221;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.isgtw.org/feature/does-computation-threaten-scientific-method&quot;&gt;&amp;#8220;Does computation threaten the scientific method
(by Leslie Hatton and Adrian Giordani)&lt;/a&gt;
and
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v482/n7386/full/nature10836.html&quot;&gt;
&amp;#8220;The case for open computer programs&amp;#8221; in &lt;i&gt;Nature&lt;/i&gt;
(by Darrel C. Ince, Leslie Hatton, and John Graham-Cumming)&lt;/a&gt;
make similar points.
For one of many examples, the paper
&lt;a href=&quot;http://fmv.jku.at/papers/Biere-ETH-TR-444-2004.pdf&quot;&gt;&amp;#8220;The Evolution from LIMMAT to NANOSAT&amp;#8221; by Armin Biere (Technical Report #444, 15 April 2004)&lt;/a&gt;
reported that they could not reproduce results because
&amp;#8220;From the publications
alone, without access to the source code,
various details were still unclear.&amp;#8221;
In the end they realized that
&amp;#8220;making source code&amp;#8230; available is as important
to the advancement of the field as publications&amp;#8221;.
I think we should not pay researchers, or their institutions,
if they fail to provide the materials necessary to reproduce the work.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I do have a request, though.
There is no patent on DDC,
nor is there a legal requirement to report using it.
Still, if you apply my approach, please
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dwheeler.com/contactme.html&quot;&gt;let me know&lt;/a&gt;;
I&amp;#8217;d like to hear about it.
Alternatively, if you are &lt;i&gt;seriously&lt;/i&gt; trying to use DDC
but are having some problems,
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dwheeler.com/contactme.html&quot;&gt;let me know&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Again -
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dwheeler.com/trusting-trust/&quot;&gt;enjoy!&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
