<p>
Free/libre/open source software (FLOSS) continues to grow around the
world, and governments around the world are trying to establish
policies about it.
Yet in the U.S. we often don&#8217;t hear about them.
I just posted about a UK policy;
<a href="http://www.april.org/en/french-prime-minister-instructions-usage-free-software-french-administration">here&#8217;s a recent French policy, translated
into English</a>.
</p>
<p>
The French administration, in September 2012, established a set of
guidelines and recommendations on the proper use of Free Software
(aka open source software) in the French government.
This is called the
&#8220;Ayrault Memorandum&#8221; (circulaire Ayrault, in French) and was
signed in September 2012 by the French Prime Minister.
The document was mainly produced by the DISIC (the
Department of Interministerial Systems Information and Communication)
and the CIOs of some departments.
The DISIC is in charge of coordinating the administration actions
on information systems.
