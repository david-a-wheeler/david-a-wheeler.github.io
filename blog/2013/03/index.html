<p>
Free/libre/open source software (FLOSS) continues to grow around the
world, and governments around the world are trying to establish
policies about it.
Yet in the U.S. we often don&#8217;t hear about them.
I just posted about a UK policy;
<a href="http://www.april.org/en/french-prime-minister-instructions-usage-free-software-french-administration">here&#8217;s a recent French policy, translated
into English</a>.
</p>
<p>
The French administration, in September 2012, established a set of
guidelines and recommendations on the proper use of Free Software
(aka open source software) in the French government.
This is called the
&#8220;Ayrault Memorandum&#8221; (circulaire Ayrault, in French) and was
signed in September 2012 by the French Prime Minister.
The document was mainly produced by the DISIC (the
Department of Interministerial Systems Information and Communication)
and the CIOs of some departments.
The DISIC is in charge of coordinating the administration actions
on information systems.

&#8220;preference&#8221; for open source software</a> in its
<a href="https://www.gov.uk/service-manual">Government Service
Design Manual</a>
<a href="https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/making-software/open-source.html">Open Source section</a>,
to be effective April 2013.
The draft manual says,
&#8220;Use open source software in preference to proprietary or closed source
alternatives, in particular for operating systems, networking software,
web servers, databases and programming languages.&#8221;

<p><a name="sweet-expressions-srfi-start"><font size="+2"><b>Readable Lisp: Sweet-expressions</b></font></a></p><p></p>
<p>
I&#8217;ve used Lisp-based programming languages
for decades, but while they have some nice properties,
their traditional s-expression notation is not very readable.
Even the original creator of Lisp
did not particularly like its notation!
However, this problem turns out to be surprisingly hard to solve.
</p>
<p>
After reviewing the many past failed efforts,
I think I have figured out why they failed.
Past solutions typically did not work because they failed to be
general (the notation is independent from any underlying semantic)
or homoiconic (the underlying data structure is clear from the syntax).
Once I realized that, I devised (with a lot of help from others!)
a new notation, called sweet-expressions (t-expressions),
that <i>is</i> general and homoiconic.
I think this creates a real solution for an old problem.
</p>
<p>
You can download and try out
sweet-expressions as released by the
<a href="http://readable.sourceforge.net/">Readable Lisp S-expressions Project</a>
by downloading our new
<a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/readable/files/?source=navbar">version 0.7.0 release</a>.
</p>
<p>
If you&#8217;re interested, please participate!
In particular, please participate in the
<a href="http://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-110/">SRFI-110 sweet-expressions (t-expressions)</a> mailing list.
SRFIs let people write specifications for extensions to the Scheme
programming language (a Lisp), and this SRFI lets
people in the Scheme community discuss it.
</p>
<p>
The following table shows what an example of traditional (ugly)
Lisp s-expressions, the same thing in sweet-expressions,
and a short explanation.
