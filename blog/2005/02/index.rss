The Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) Legal Project
has just announced the
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.owasp.org/documentation/legal.html&quot;&gt;
&amp;#8220;Secure Software Development Contract Annex&amp;#8221;&lt;/a&gt;.
This is basically a starting point for a contract to do software development;
it tries to spell out exactly what&amp;#8217;s required so that the
results are secure.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I didn&amp;#8217;t develop this text, but I&amp;#8217;m glad to see that some people
are working on it.
In the contracting world, if you don&amp;#8217;t specifically ask for it, you don&amp;#8217;t
get it.
Since most contracts today don&amp;#8217;t specifically say that a secure
result is needed (and what that means), currently
the person paying for the software isn&amp;#8217;t getting a secure product.
Hopefully this sort of thing will solve the problem.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Personally, I think this is a &amp;#8220;first draft&amp;#8221;; there are things I&amp;#8217;d like
to see made more specific.
For example, I think it should clearly state that in the development
environment it should be possible to determine &lt;i&gt;specifically, by name&lt;/i&gt;,
who wrote any given line of code.
And there are many other issues (like automated examination of code)
that aren&amp;#8217;t covered.
In particular, there are many more common vulnerabilities than the top ten
list of OWASP.
But this is a very interesting and encouraging
first start, and I&amp;#8217;m glad to see it.
&lt;/p&gt;
