<p>
The Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) Legal Project
has just announced the
<a href="http://www.owasp.org/documentation/legal.html">
&#8220;Secure Software Development Contract Annex&#8221;</a>.
This is basically a starting point for a contract to do software development;
it tries to spell out exactly what&#8217;s required so that the
results are secure.
</p>
<p>
I didn&#8217;t develop this text, but I&#8217;m glad to see that some people
are working on it.
In the contracting world, if you don&#8217;t specifically ask for it, you don&#8217;t
get it.
Since most contracts today don&#8217;t specifically say that a secure
result is needed (and what that means), currently
the person paying for the software isn&#8217;t getting a secure product.
Hopefully this sort of thing will solve the problem.
</p>
<p>
Personally, I think this is a &#8220;first draft&#8221;; there are things I&#8217;d like
to see made more specific.
For example, I think it should clearly state that in the development
environment it should be possible to determine <i>specifically, by name</i>,
who wrote any given line of code.
And there are many other issues (like automated examination of code)
that aren&#8217;t covered.
In particular, there are many more common vulnerabilities than the top ten
list of OWASP.
But this is a very interesting and encouraging
first start, and I&#8217;m glad to see it.
