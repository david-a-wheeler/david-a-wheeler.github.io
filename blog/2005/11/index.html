<p>
A relative gave me an old laptop with Windows 98,
Which led me to the question: can you take a castoff laptop and,
with zero or <i>very little</i> money, improve it so it&#8217;s more useful
and can run more &#8220;modern&#8221; software?
The answer is: yes!
In fact, this turned into a little game/project for me, and I learned
a few things along the way.
So I wrote down what I decided to do, in the hopes
that you may find these ideas useful for reviving an old laptop yourself:

</p>
<p>
I think it&#8217;s a shame that older machines sometimes rot in closets instead
of helping people, and I hope that this document will help change that.
With a little elbow grease (and adjusted expectations), you can still
get mileage out of an older laptop.

<p><a name="java-roadmap"><font size="+2"><b>FLOSS Java Roadmap published</b></font></a></p><p></p>
<p>
Ever since Richard Stallman wrote his article
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/java-trap.html">Free But Shackled -
The Java Trap</a>,
many developers have avoided using Java.
Why? At the time, there was no practical way to delivery fully
free-libre / open source software (FLOSS) using Java while still
being fully functional.
Not because it was illegal to have a FLOSS Java implementation,
but simply because the FLOSS tools and libraries weren&#8217;t available.
</p>
<p>
But things have been moving quickly; many developers have been working
hard to develop an implementation of Java that doesn&#8217;t depend on
proprietary software.
The problem is that there hasn&#8217;t been a simple way to understand
what&#8217;s going on &#8212; unless you&#8217;re an &#8220;insider&#8221;.
</p>
<p>
Thankfully, that&#8217;s changed.
<a href="http://developer.classpath.org/support/">
Escaping the Java Trap: A practical road map to the Free Software and Open
Source alternatives</a>
is a simple 3-page summary that surveys the many different FLOSS projects
that are building, testing, and distributing a complete FLOSS Java
implementation (including mountains of libraries).
As the roadmap notes,
&#8220;Important
large applications like JOnAS, OpenOffice.org 2, Eclipse 3 and Tomcat 5 are
known to work. This document provides a road map of the various projects; how
they work together, where they are, where they&#8217;re going, and how we make sure
that they work well and are compatible.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
This is the roadmap I noted earlier
<a href="http://www.dwheeler.com/essays/fisl2005.html#javaimp">
as part of my FISL 2005 travelogue</a>.
Although I helped the other authors write it, I really operated as
a ghost writer rather than speaking with my own voice.
Basically, I really wanted to know what the state of FLOSS Java
implementations was, and I was fortunate to be able to talk with the
top experts at FISL.
I promised them if they told me about the various parts, I would in turn
help them describe it in a simple way.
So the material is really all theirs &#8212; I was just lucky enough to
be the first recipient of it.
</p>
<p>
Other articles also help give more perspectives on the topic, too.
<a href="http://www.redhat.com/magazine/012oct05/features/java/">
The state of Java on Linux</a> by Tom Tromey
has some interesting material, for example.
But I know of no other document that gives such a wide overview of
how a full FLOSS implementation of Java (TM) is getting built,
tested, and distributed.
</p>
<p>
Again, take a peek:

Source alternatives</a>

<p><a name="opendocument-accessibility"><font size="+2"><b>OpenDocument Accessibility</b></font></a></p><p></p>
<p>
There has been a lot of virtual ink spent on OpenDocument accessibility.
I&#8217;ve written up a
<a href="http://www.dwheeler.com/essays/opendocument-accessibility.html">
short essay on OpenDocument accessibility</a>,
where I point to some other resources that talk about OpenDocument
accessibility,
and point out that there are lots of ways to get it.
For a vast number of cases, products that natively support OpenDocument
do just fine today.
For some cases, just use Microsoft Office with an OpenDocument plug-in;
you already have to use a third party plug-in to add accessibility in
those cases, so saying that you can&#8217;t add a third-party plug-in for
OpenDocument as well is simply hypocritical.
</p>
<p>
I also post a lengthy letter from Wesley Parish,
who is disabled and yet is a strong supporter of OpenDocument.
The article has more, but here are a few quotes:
&#8220;It is necessary for the
disabled to have access to all government information relevant to them, in a
file format that is readily available for as many different applications from
as wish it, one that does not insist that one jump through licensing hoops in
order to implement it, one that can be readily extended in the future
according to need - and one that can not be used as an excuse by lazy
bureaucrats to deny me my rights!
The question currently buzzing in Massachussetts is , &#8220;Does Open Document
Format limit accessibility?&#8221; For myself, I find it does not.
[In Computer Science] I found one
of the most persistent concepts was a strict separation between data and
executable code.
ODF provides that strict separation, defining data separately from the code.
&#8230; An open specification
that allows ANYONE to implement accessibility solutions is the way to solve
the problems of access by the the blind and other disabled. Otherwise,
government data will be tied to specific programs and NOT accessible to all,
and in time, NOT accessible at all.&#8221;
</p>

<h1>Sun, 13 Nov 2005</h1>
<p><a name="oss-why-20051113"><font size="+2"><b>November 2005 release of &#8220;Why OSS/FS? Look at the Numbers!&#8221;</b></font></a></p><p></p>
<p>
It&#8217;s November, and I&#8217;m putting out another release of
<a href="http://www.dwheeler.com/oss_fs_why.html">&#8220;Why Open Source Software /
Free Software (OSS/FS, FLOSS, FOSS)? Look at the Numbers!&#8221;</a>
This paper continues to provide
&#8220;quantitative data that, in many cases, using open source
software / free software (abbreviated as OSS/FS, FLOSS, or FOSS) is a
reasonable or even superior approach to using their proprietary competition
according to various measures. This paperâ€™s goal is to show that you should
consider using OSS/FS when acquiring software.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
The <i>big news</i> is
that I&#8217;m releasing a presentation based on this report.
The presentation is at
<a href="http://www.dwheeler.com/numbers">
http://www.dwheeler.com/numbers</a> &#8212; and you can
use it as-is or as the starting point for own presentations.
The presentation is being released in two formats, PDF (for reading) and
OpenDocument (for presenting or editing).
I&#8217;m hoping that many other people will be willing to create
translations of this presentation.
The presentation is <i>much</i> smaller,
and thus much easier to translate, than my thorough
(but <i>much</i> larger) work.
</p>
<p>
I&#8217;ve made a number of changes since May as well.
Here are some of the highlights:
<ol>
<li>Added a new performance report on
<a href="http://blogs.zdnet.com/Murphy/?p=459">Unix and Linux beat
Windows</a>&#8230;  the funny thing is that it&#8217;s from Microsoft.
</li>
<li>
Various URL fixups, as websites change their address.
For example, the URL of the Netcraft survey archive is now
<a href="http://survey.netcraft.com/">http://survey.netcraft.com/</a>.
</li>
<li>
<a href="http://i.cmpnet.com/infoweek/1057/IWKLinuxOutlook-2005.pdf">
Information Week Research&#8217;s study of corporate use of Linux
and Open Source software</a>.
They found that &#8220;Nearly 90% of companies we surveyed anticipate a jump in
server licenses for Linux. No other product comes close to these
expectations - not Windows, Macintosh or Unix.&#8221;
</li>
<li>
Added references to
<a href="http://www.businessweek.com/technology/content/oct2005/tc20050103_7038_tc_218.htm">BusinessWeek&#8217;s interesting market figures</a>.
</li>
<li>
Noted Symantec&#8217;s newest security study, and its
misunderstood results.  Firefox has more
vulnerabilities than Internet Explorer, UNLESS you count
vulnerabilities Microsoft hasn&#8217;t fixed, in which case IE has more
vulnerabilities.
Some people haven&#8217;t looked at these numbers closely, and think
that they are an argument <i>for</i> the security of IE, which is nonsense.
I think vulnerability counts are a lousy metric, so it&#8217;s fine to
complain about that&#8230; I do!
But DON&#8217;T rig the metric and <i>ignore</i> known vulnerabilities
just because a supplier does&#8230; that is rediculous.
</li>
<li>
Added a reference to
<a href="http://www.investors.com/editorial/IBDArticles.asp?artsec=16&issue=20050921">an Investors article on OSS/FS commercialization</a>.
</li>
<li>
Added
<a href="http://www-1.ibm.com/linux/whitepapers/robertFrancesGroupLinuxTCOAnalysis05.pdf">RFG&#8217;s August 2005 TCO report</a>
</li>
<li>
Updated the OpenSSH marketshare data.
Their September 2004 survey shows them dominating the SSH market,
with 87.9% share.  What&#8217;s possibly more important is the trend
line; there&#8217;s no evidence that OpenSSH is being eliminated by
proprietary products at all.
</li>
<li>
Noted newer Coverity study of Linux kernel defect rate (August 2005), which
complements their earlier studies).
</li>
<li>
Referenced
more recent summaries as of August 2005, which suggest
that Internet Explorer is still
more dangerous than the OSS/FS Firefox.  David Hammond&#8217;s
<a href="http://nanobox.chipx86.com/ie_is_dangerous.php">
Internet Explorer is dangerous</a> examined the Secunia reports on
Internet Explorer, Firefox, and Opera, as of August 4, 2005.
Firefox did far better than IE, both historically and currently.
</li>
<li>
Added <a href="http://bcheck.scanit.be/bcheck/page.php?name=STATS2004">
statistics</a> by Scanit&#8217;s Browser Security Test group, which
found that 98% of time in 2004 Internet Explorer was vulnerable
to dangerous known remote attacks,
compared to 17% for Opera and 15% for Mozilla/Firefox.
I also added a link to an
<a href="http://www.internetnews.com/security/article.php/3374931">
article that explains the context of DHS&#8217;s earlier warnings.</a>
</li>
<li>
Added a reference to an
<a href="http://www.multicians.org/fjcc1.html">paper about
Multics</a>, which shows that even back
then, people thought that it was critical to have source code publicly
avaiable if security was important.
Here&#8217;s what it said:
&#8220;It is expected that the Multics system will be published when it is
operating substantially and will therefore be available for
implementation on any equipment with suitable characteristics. Such
publication is desirable for two reasons: First, the system should
withstand public scrutiny and criticism volunteered by interested
readers; second, in an age of increasing complexity, it is an
obligation to present and future system designers to make the inner
operating system as lucid as possible so as to reveal the basic
system issues&#8230;
The system will evolve under the influence of the users and their
activities for a long time and in directions which are hard to
predict at this time&#8230;  It is
expected that most of the system additions will come from the users
themselves and the system will eventually become the repository of
the procedure and data knowledge of the community.&#8221;

<li>
Noted that GNU/Linux basically owns the high-end computing area.
60% of all supercomputers run GNU/Linux, including
the world&#8217;s fastest, as of March 2005;
80% of the top ten supercomputers run GNU/Linux, and
Noted that the Internet Archive (the world&#8217;s biggest library
counting by text) uses GNU/Linux.
</li>
</ol>
</p>
<p>
Were I to start now, I think I&#8217;d use the term &#8220;FLOSS&#8221;
(Free-Libre / Open Source Software) as my all-encompassing term,
so I mention that at the beginning.
FLOSS is much easier to say than some of the alternatives.
The term &#8220;Free Software&#8221; is widely misunderstood as being &#8220;no cost&#8221;, so
by itself I find that it&#8217;s not helpful for explaining things.
The term Free-Libre is a big improvement because it
at least hints at what its promulgators intended the term to mean.
However, I&#8217;ve used the term OSS/FS all over, and it&#8217;s awkward to change now
(and people might not find the document they were looking for), so
I haven&#8217;t changed my own documents.

Enjoy!
