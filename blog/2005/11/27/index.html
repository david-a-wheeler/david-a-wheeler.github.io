<p>
Ever since Richard Stallman wrote his article
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/java-trap.html">Free But Shackled -
The Java Trap</a>,
many developers have avoided using Java.
Why? At the time, there was no practical way to delivery fully
free-libre / open source software (FLOSS) using Java while still
being fully functional.
Not because it was illegal to have a FLOSS Java implementation,
but simply because the FLOSS tools and libraries weren&#8217;t available.
</p>
<p>
But things have been moving quickly; many developers have been working
hard to develop an implementation of Java that doesn&#8217;t depend on
proprietary software.
The problem is that there hasn&#8217;t been a simple way to understand
what&#8217;s going on &#8212; unless you&#8217;re an &#8220;insider&#8221;.
</p>
<p>
Thankfully, that&#8217;s changed.
<a href="http://developer.classpath.org/support/">
Escaping the Java Trap: A practical road map to the Free Software and Open
Source alternatives</a>
is a simple 3-page summary that surveys the many different FLOSS projects
that are building, testing, and distributing a complete FLOSS Java
implementation (including mountains of libraries).
As the roadmap notes,
&#8220;Important
large applications like JOnAS, OpenOffice.org 2, Eclipse 3 and Tomcat 5 are
known to work. This document provides a road map of the various projects; how
they work together, where they are, where they&#8217;re going, and how we make sure
that they work well and are compatible.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
This is the roadmap I noted earlier
<a href="http://www.dwheeler.com/essays/fisl2005.html#javaimp">
as part of my FISL 2005 travelogue</a>.
Although I helped the other authors write it, I really operated as
a ghost writer rather than speaking with my own voice.
Basically, I really wanted to know what the state of FLOSS Java
implementations was, and I was fortunate to be able to talk with the
top experts at FISL.
I promised them if they told me about the various parts, I would in turn
help them describe it in a simple way.
So the material is really all theirs &#8212; I was just lucky enough to
be the first recipient of it.
</p>
<p>
Other articles also help give more perspectives on the topic, too.
<a href="http://www.redhat.com/magazine/012oct05/features/java/">
The state of Java on Linux</a> by Tom Tromey
has some interesting material, for example.
But I know of no other document that gives such a wide overview of
how a full FLOSS implementation of Java (TM) is getting built,
tested, and distributed.
