&lt;p&gt;
I&amp;#8217;ve posted an update of
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dwheeler.com/oss_fs_why.html&quot;&gt;&amp;#8220;Why Open Source Software /
Free Software (OSS/FS, FLOSS, FOSS)? Look at the Numbers!&amp;#8221;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The biggest change?
I&amp;#8217;ve added a large set of studies about the market penetration of the Mozilla
web browsers (primarily the newer Mozilla Firefox, but the
older Mozilla suite is also in use), as compared to Internet Explorer (IE).
A multitude of studies show that IE is losing market share,
while OSS/FS web browsers (particularly Firefox) are gaining market share.
Sources of data include
general market surveys like
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.websidestory.com/services-solutions/datainsights/spotlight.html&quot;&gt;WebSideStory&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.onestat.com/html/aboutus_pressbox36.html&quot;&gt;OneStat&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.informationweek.com/&quot;&gt;Information Week/Net Applications&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thecounter.com/stats/&quot;&gt;thecounter.com&lt;/a&gt;,
and
&lt;a href=&quot;&quot;http://www.figby.com/archives/2005/02/28/browser-stats-the-state-of-firefox/&quot;&gt;quotationspage.com&lt;/a&gt;,
as well as more specialized sources such as
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.w3schools.com/browsers/browsers_stats.asp&quot;&gt;W3Schools&lt;/a&gt;
(web developers)
and
Ars Technica (computer technologists).
The figure below extracts data from several sources (there are far
more in my paper than I can legibly show), but they all show the
market trend over time.
The red squares are Internet Explorer&amp;#8217;s market share (all versions),
and the blue circles are the combination of the older Mozilla suite and
the newer Mozilla Firefox web browser (both of which are OSS/FS):
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dwheeler.com/frozen/browser-marketshare-20050402.png&quot;&gt;
&lt;img align=&quot;middle&quot; src=&quot;http://www.dwheeler.com/frozen/browser-marketshare-20050402.png&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;272&quot; alt=&quot;Web Browser Market Share (Wheeler Summary) - IE is losing market share while Mozilla Firefox gains market share&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The data seems to show a small, gradual trend in the general web
browsing community, with a much larger and more rapid
move towards Mozilla and Mozilla Firefox
in the home user, technical, web development, and blogging communities.
In some cases (such as the Ars Technica technical site and the
Boing Boing blog site), Firefox has become the &lt;i&gt;leading&lt;/i&gt;
web browser!
That&amp;#8217;s interesting particularly because it can be easily argued that
the technical, web development, and blogging communities are leading
indicators; these are the developers of the web sites you&amp;#8217;ll see tomorrow and
some of the heaviest users of the web, all making a switch.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
One study not shown in the figure above
(because it&amp;#8217;s a single point of data) is from
XitiMonitor. They surveyed a sample of websites used on a Sunday
(March 6, 2005), totalling 16,650,993 visits, and categorized
various European users.
By surveying on Sunday, they intended to primarily find out what people
&lt;i&gt;choose&lt;/i&gt; to use, from their homes.
Of the German users, an astonishing 21.4% were using Firefox.
The other countries surveyed were France (12.2%), England (10.9%),
Spain (9%), and Italy (8.6%).
Here is
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.xitimonitor.com/etudes/equipement4.asp&quot;&gt;
the original XitiMonitor study of 2005-03-06&lt;/a&gt;,
an
&lt;a href=&quot;http://translate.google.com/translate?u=http%3A//www.xitimonitor.com/etudes/equipement4.asp&amp;amp;langpair=fr%7Cen&amp;amp;prev=/language_tools&quot;&gt;
automated translation of the XitiMonitor study&lt;/a&gt;,
and
&lt;a href=&quot;http://standblog.org/blog/2005/03/15/93114061-firefox-usage-in-europe-during-week-ends&quot;&gt;a blog summary of the XitiMonitor study&lt;/a&gt;
observing that,
&amp;#8220;Web sites aiming at the consumer have [no] other choice but [to make]
sure that they are compatible with Firefox &amp;#8230;
Ignoring compatibility with Firefox and other modern browsers
does not make sense business-wise.&amp;#8221;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I analyzed this data to determine that
13.3% of European home users were using Firefox
on this date in March 2005.
How can I justify that figure?
Well, we can use these major European countries as representatives of
Europe as a whole; they&amp;#8217;re &lt;i&gt;certainly&lt;/i&gt; representative of western
Europe, since they&amp;#8217;re the most populous countries.
Presuming that the vast majority of Sunday users are home users is
quite reasonable for Europe.
We can then make the reasonable presumption that the number of
web browser users is proportional to the general
population.
Then we just need to get the countries&amp;#8217; populations; I used the
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/&quot;&gt;CIA World Fact Book
updated to 2005-02-10&lt;/a&gt;.
These countries&amp;#8217; populations (in millions) are, in the same order as above,
82, 60, 60, 40, and 58;
calculating
(21.4%*82 + 12.2%*60 + 10.9%*60 + 9%*40 + 8.6%*58) / (82+60+60+40+58)
yields 13.3%.
&lt;!--
Germany  82,424,609
France  60,424,213
U.K.  60,270,708
Spain  40,280,780
Italy  58,057,477
--&gt;
This is something you &lt;i&gt;won&amp;#8217;t&lt;/i&gt; find on other pages; this is
new analysis unique to my paper.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
For all the detail on web browser market surveys, see
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dwheeler.com/oss_fs_why.html#browser-marketshare&quot;&gt;
http://www.dwheeler.com/oss_fs_why.html#browser-marketshare&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
And yes, I&amp;#8217;ve made lots of other improvements to the paper.
Here are a few examples:
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
I made a number of small improvements to the government section.
For example,
I expanded the introductory section, and
I added a reference to the collection of essays
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.aei.brookings.org/publications/abstract.php?pid=296&quot;&gt;
&amp;#8220;Government Policy toward Open Source Software&amp;#8221; &lt;/a&gt;
I noted that many governments like the ability to
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.adityanag.org/articles/ooo_interview.htm&quot;&gt;internationalize
their software&lt;/a&gt;.
I also noted that the
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/egov/a-1-fea.html&quot;&gt;
United States&amp;#8217; Federal Enterprise Architecture
includes the Technical Reference Model (TRM)&lt;/a&gt;,
and TRM version 1.1 (August 2003) includes both Linux and Apache.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
Added a reference to
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.onlamp.com/pub/a/onlamp/2005/03/24/shared_source.html&quot;&gt;
happy customers of Microsoft&amp;#8217;s OSS/FS WiX project&lt;/a&gt; &amp;#8212; even Microsoft
finds that this OSS/FS seems to work for them.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
I added a reference to a book on OSS/FS licensing,
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/osfreesoft/book/&quot;&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Understanding Open Source and Free Software Licensing&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
by Andrew M. St. Laurent.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
Added references to Lessig&amp;#8217;s
&lt;a href=&quot;http://codebook.jot.com/Book&quot;&gt;&amp;#8220;Code and Other Laws of Cyberspace&amp;#8221;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
I added a discussion about
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dwheeler.com/oss_fs_why.html#visual_basic&quot;&gt;
Visual Basic for .NET, aka Visual Fred&lt;/a&gt;.
This is a particularly shocking example: here we have a
proprietary vendor who is essentially abandoning a common, widely-used product,
even after there&amp;#8217;s been a public outcry.
The &amp;#8220;new&amp;#8221; Visual Basic is completely incompatible with the old version of
Visual Basic, so different that people now call the new version
&amp;#8220;Visual Fred&amp;#8221;.
There&amp;#8217;s no practical upgrade path; Visual Basic programs have to be
essentially rewritten to use the &amp;#8220;new&amp;#8221; version, and about 2/3 of current
Visual Basic programmers end up switching to a new language
(not Visual Fred, which is just as proprietary and risky as the
previous Visual Basic).
Everyone knows that if a proprietary company goes out of business, people
who depend on their software will be in trouble.
But people often forget that a proprietary company can choose to go in a
different direction for their own reasons, even if that will cost you
billions of dollars&amp;#8230; and there&amp;#8217;s little you can do about it if there
are no alternatives.
This is a good cautionary tale about why people should
choose languages that are standardized with multiple vendors or
have a viable OSS/FS implementation;
that way, users have a way to continue maintenance if the
original developer decides to go in a way against the users&amp;#8217; interests.
Depending on a proprietary computer language,
with a single proprietary implementation, has
been known to be a risky decision for decades.
Unfortunately, it appears that this lesson never really gets learned.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://news.zdnet.co.uk/software/linuxunix/0,39020390,39190950,00.htm&quot;&gt;
Added information on an unintentional reliability study done by
Heinz Trober.&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
Added a quote from Unisys&amp;#8217; Steve Rawsthorn.
Years ago Unisys was a strong holdout against supporting Linux,
compared to most companies.
But Unisys found that they were repeatedly losing competitive bids to
other companies who &lt;i&gt;did&lt;/i&gt; support Linux.
Finally, Unisys decided to support Linux systems because they wanted to
be able to make money;
Linux was what their potential customers wanted to buy.
Hmm, supporting Linux so that you can make money?
Now &lt;i&gt;that&amp;#8217;s&lt;/i&gt; a reason for doing something that &lt;i&gt;everyone&lt;/i&gt;
understands!
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
I&amp;#8217;ve improved the text explaining the Fuzz results,
and added a chart to make their results clearer.
This is all part of the
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dwheeler.com/oss_fs_why.html#reliability&quot;&gt;reliability
section&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
And a trivial change:
clarified that &amp;#8220;GPL&amp;#8221; stands for the &amp;#8220;GNU General Public License&amp;#8221;.
There are other &amp;#8220;General Public Licenses&amp;#8221; out there, but
everyone means the GNU license unless otherwise stated.
That way, I can just say &amp;#8220;GPL&amp;#8221; and appeal to the definition
at the top of the paper, which clarifies that it&amp;#8217;s the GNU version.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
