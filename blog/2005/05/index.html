<p>
I&#8217;ll be speaking at the
<a href="http://fisl.softwarelivre.org/6.0/index.php?language=en">
&#8220;6th International Free Software Forum&#8221; in Porto Alegre, Brazil</a>.
Its Portuguese name is 6&#176; F&#243;rum Internacional Software
Livre, so this is abbreviated as &#8220;FISL&#8221;.
The conference itself is 1-4 June, 2005.
</p>
<p>
I&#8217;ll be speaking on June 3, 2005, from 17:15-18:15.
I&#8217;ll be presenting in room 41A (in the 41 building).
This is their biggest room, with 1000 person capacity and
sessions with simultaneous translation.
That may sound like a lot, but
as of May 27 there were 3,180 attendees registered, and I&#8217;m sure there will be
more at the door.
So if you&#8217;re interested, please come early!
</p>
<p>
My presentation will summarize my work,
<a href="http://www.dwheeler.com/oss_fs_why.html">Why Open Source Software /
Free Software (OSS/FS)? Look at the Numbers!</a>
Here&#8217;s the summary:
<blockquote>
&#8220;The goal of this lecture is to convince you to consider using OSS/FS
when you’re looking for software, using quantitive measures. Some
sites provide a few anecdotes on why you should use OSS/FS, but for many
that’s not enough information to justify using OSS/FS. Instead, this
paper emphasizes quantitative measures (such as experiments and market
studies) to justify why using OSS/FS products is in many circumstances
a reasonable or even superior approach.&#8221;
</blockquote>
</p>
<p>
I hope to see you there!

<p><a name="dennis-fife"><font size="+2"><b>In memorium: Dennis W. Fife</b></font></a></p><p></p>
<p>
My long-time boss, mentor, and friend,
Dr. Dennis W. Fife, passed away on April 28, 2005.
His funeral was held on May 2, 2005.
</p>
<p>
Dennis was a good man, who dearly loved truth.
On many occasions he spoke the truth to those he worked for,
even when the truth was very unpopular.
Yet he never did this maliciously; he always did this gently,
trying to help people move to a more productive path.
</p>
<p>
He was smart, and enjoyed learning new things.
He wrote important documents of their time on approaches to
managing software development; many of his ideas are still applied
today (though not always acknowledged!).
He later helped many others apply computing to solve real problems.
Indeed, he was always willing to share his knowledge with others, including
the mentoring of many who are very grateful for his guidance.
When asked a question, he&#8217;d think about it for a moment, and afterwards
he&#8217;d often reply with a helpful insight into the situation.
</p>
<p>
Dennis also had a dry, subtle wit that many of us grew to love.
Dennis enjoyed comics like the &#8220;Far Side&#8221;, with its often twisted
view of the world.
He would often would say subtle things with a twinkle in his eye&#8230;
it might take you a moment to get it, and then you&#8217;d laugh out loud.
</p>
<p>
I will greatly miss him.

<p><a name="simple-markup"><font size="+2"><b>Trend: Simple, readable text markup languages</b></font></a></p><p></p>
<p>
Here&#8217;s a new(?) trend, that shows that everything old
really <i>is</i> sometimes new again.
What&#8217;s the trend? Simple, highly readable markup languages.
</p>
<p>
In some situations, typical document formats
(such as OpenDocument or Word .doc format) simply don&#8217;t work well.
This includes massive collaboration over an internet, or for
creating relatively simple/short documents.
Although existing markup languages
like DocBook, HTML/XHTML, LaTex, and nroff/man all work,
they&#8217;re often complicated to write and read.
You could use SGML or XML to create your own markup language, but
that doesn&#8217;t really address the need for simplicity.
None of these work very well if you expect to
have many users who don&#8217;t really understand computers deeply
(HTML comes closest, but complicated HTML documents become unreadable
in a hurry).
</p>
<p>
Thus, there&#8217;s been a resurgence of new markup languages that are really
easy to read and write, which can then be automatically translated
to other formats.
Two especially capable examples of this trend seem to be
AsciiDoc and MediaWiki:
<ol>
<li><a href="http://www.methods.co.nz/asciidoc/">AsciiDoc</a>
looks very reasonable if you want to create documents or websites;
it can generate HTML, XML, DocBook, PDF, and man pages
(DocBook can in turn generate other formats; it can also generate
the obsolete LinuxDoc format).
This is no trivial capability; it can handle cross-links, tables, and so on.
Technically, AsciiDoc processing requires an implementation
to look ahead to the next line to
understand text; some find this annoying, but if it makes the language
easy to read, I think that&#8217;s quite reasonable.
<li><a href="http://www.wikipedia.org">Wikipedia&#8217;s markup language (supported
by MediaWiki)</a>
has grown a lot of capabilities (to support creating an encyclopedia),
yet it&#8217;s still easy to use (and thus is a really capable example of this).
There are a vast number of users of this notation, but setting up a processor
for it isn&#8217;t so easy.
</ol>
</p>
<p>
The various Wiki languages, such as MoinMoin&#8217;s, etc.,
are also examples of this.
But there are a lot of different ones, all incompatible.
Here&#8217;s some text on
<a href="http://zwiki.org/StructuredText">StructuredText</a>,
<a href="http://zwiki.org/ReStructuredText">ReStructuredText</a>,
and
<a href="http://collab.blueoxen.net/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?WikiText">WikiText</a>.
Many Wiki languages use CamelCase to create links, unfortunately;
a lot of people (including me) find that convention ugly and awkward
(MediaWiki dumped CamelCase years ago; MediaWiki internal links look like this:
[[MediaWiki link]]).
Most Wiki languages are too limiting for wider use.
</p>
<p>
No doubt there are others.
One I learned about recently is
<a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown</a>.
Markdown
is a notation for simply writing text and generating HTML or XHTML;
it seems to be focused on helping bloggers.
</p>
<p>
Anyway, it&#8217;s an interesting trend!
I&#8217;ve created a new essay about this at
<a href="http://www.dwheeler.com/essays/simple-markup.html">
http://www.dwheeler.com/essays/simple-markup.html</a>; if I
learn about interesting new links related to this, I&#8217;ll add them there.
