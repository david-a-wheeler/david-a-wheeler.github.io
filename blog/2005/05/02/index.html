<p><a name="simple-markup"><font size="+2"><b>Trend: Simple, readable text markup languages</b></font></a></p><p></p>
<p>
Here&#8217;s a new(?) trend, that shows that everything old
really <i>is</i> sometimes new again.
What&#8217;s the trend? Simple, highly readable markup languages.
</p>
<p>
In some situations, typical document formats
(such as OpenDocument or Word .doc format) simply don&#8217;t work well.
This includes massive collaboration over an internet, or for
creating relatively simple/short documents.
Although existing markup languages
like DocBook, HTML/XHTML, LaTex, and nroff/man all work,
they&#8217;re often complicated to write and read.
You could use SGML or XML to create your own markup language, but
that doesn&#8217;t really address the need for simplicity.
None of these work very well if you expect to
have many users who don&#8217;t really understand computers deeply
(HTML comes closest, but complicated HTML documents become unreadable
in a hurry).
</p>
<p>
Thus, there&#8217;s been a resurgence of new markup languages that are really
easy to read and write, which can then be automatically translated
to other formats.
Two especially capable examples of this trend seem to be
AsciiDoc and MediaWiki:
<ol>
<li><a href="http://www.methods.co.nz/asciidoc/">AsciiDoc</a>
looks very reasonable if you want to create documents or websites;
it can generate HTML, XML, DocBook, PDF, and man pages
(DocBook can in turn generate other formats; it can also generate
the obsolete LinuxDoc format).
This is no trivial capability; it can handle cross-links, tables, and so on.
Technically, AsciiDoc processing requires an implementation
to look ahead to the next line to
understand text; some find this annoying, but if it makes the language
easy to read, I think that&#8217;s quite reasonable.
<li><a href="http://www.wikipedia.org">Wikipedia&#8217;s markup language (supported
by MediaWiki)</a>
has grown a lot of capabilities (to support creating an encyclopedia),
yet it&#8217;s still easy to use (and thus is a really capable example of this).
There are a vast number of users of this notation, but setting up a processor
for it isn&#8217;t so easy.
</ol>
</p>
<p>
The various Wiki languages, such as MoinMoin&#8217;s, etc.,
are also examples of this.
But there are a lot of different ones, all incompatible.
Here&#8217;s some text on
<a href="http://zwiki.org/StructuredText">StructuredText</a>,
<a href="http://zwiki.org/ReStructuredText">ReStructuredText</a>,
and
<a href="http://collab.blueoxen.net/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?WikiText">WikiText</a>.
Many Wiki languages use CamelCase to create links, unfortunately;
a lot of people (including me) find that convention ugly and awkward
(MediaWiki dumped CamelCase years ago; MediaWiki internal links look like this:
[[MediaWiki link]]).
Most Wiki languages are too limiting for wider use.
</p>
<p>
No doubt there are others.
One I learned about recently is
<a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown</a>.
Markdown
is a notation for simply writing text and generating HTML or XHTML;
it seems to be focused on helping bloggers.
</p>
<p>
Anyway, it&#8217;s an interesting trend!
I&#8217;ve created a new essay about this at
<a href="http://www.dwheeler.com/essays/simple-markup.html">
http://www.dwheeler.com/essays/simple-markup.html</a>; if I
learn about interesting new links related to this, I&#8217;ll add them there.
