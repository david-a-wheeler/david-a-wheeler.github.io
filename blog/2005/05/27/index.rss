&lt;p&gt;
I&amp;#8217;ll be speaking at the
&lt;a href=&quot;http://fisl.softwarelivre.org/6.0/index.php?language=en&quot;&gt;
&amp;#8220;6th International Free Software Forum&amp;#8221; in Porto Alegre, Brazil&lt;/a&gt;.
Its Portuguese name is 6&amp;#176; F&amp;#243;rum Internacional Software
Livre, so this is abbreviated as &amp;#8220;FISL&amp;#8221;.
The conference itself is 1-4 June, 2005.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I&amp;#8217;ll be speaking on June 3, 2005, from 17:15-18:15.
I&amp;#8217;ll be presenting in room 41A (in the 41 building).
This is their biggest room, with 1000 person capacity and
sessions with simultaneous translation.
That may sound like a lot, but
as of May 27 there were 3,180 attendees registered, and I&amp;#8217;m sure there will be
more at the door.
So if you&amp;#8217;re interested, please come early!
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
My presentation will summarize my work,
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dwheeler.com/oss_fs_why.html&quot;&gt;Why Open Source Software /
Free Software (OSS/FS)? Look at the Numbers!&lt;/a&gt;
Here&amp;#8217;s the summary:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&amp;#8220;The goal of this lecture is to convince you to consider using OSS/FS
when you’re looking for software, using quantitive measures. Some
sites provide a few anecdotes on why you should use OSS/FS, but for many
that’s not enough information to justify using OSS/FS. Instead, this
paper emphasizes quantitative measures (such as experiments and market
studies) to justify why using OSS/FS products is in many circumstances
a reasonable or even superior approach.&amp;#8221;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I hope to see you there!
&lt;/p&gt;
