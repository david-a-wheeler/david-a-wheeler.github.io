<p>
I&#8217;ll be speaking at the
<a href="http://fisl.softwarelivre.org/6.0/index.php?language=en">
&#8220;6th International Free Software Forum&#8221; in Porto Alegre, Brazil</a>.
Its Portuguese name is 6&#176; F&#243;rum Internacional Software
Livre, so this is abbreviated as &#8220;FISL&#8221;.
The conference itself is 1-4 June, 2005.
</p>
<p>
I&#8217;ll be speaking on June 3, 2005, from 17:15-18:15.
I&#8217;ll be presenting in room 41A (in the 41 building).
This is their biggest room, with 1000 person capacity and
sessions with simultaneous translation.
That may sound like a lot, but
as of May 27 there were 3,180 attendees registered, and I&#8217;m sure there will be
more at the door.
So if you&#8217;re interested, please come early!
</p>
<p>
My presentation will summarize my work,
<a href="http://www.dwheeler.com/oss_fs_why.html">Why Open Source Software /
Free Software (OSS/FS)? Look at the Numbers!</a>
Here&#8217;s the summary:
<blockquote>
&#8220;The goal of this lecture is to convince you to consider using OSS/FS
when you’re looking for software, using quantitive measures. Some
sites provide a few anecdotes on why you should use OSS/FS, but for many
that’s not enough information to justify using OSS/FS. Instead, this
paper emphasizes quantitative measures (such as experiments and market
studies) to justify why using OSS/FS products is in many circumstances
a reasonable or even superior approach.&#8221;
</blockquote>

<p>
I hope to see you there!
