&lt;p&gt;
As I noted earlier, I spoke at the
&lt;a href=&quot;http://fisl.softwarelivre.org/6.0/index.php?language=en&quot;&gt;
&amp;#8220;6th International Free Software Forum&amp;#8221; /
F&amp;#243;rum Internacional Software Livre (FISL)&lt;/a&gt;.
The conference was 1-4 June, 2005.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I&amp;#8217;ve just posted
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dwheeler.com/essays/fisl2005.html&quot;&gt;my
travelogue of the 6th International Free Software Forum in
Porto Alegre, Brazil.&lt;/a&gt;
If you didn&amp;#8217;t get to go, this may give you an idea what it was like.
I also try to make some observations along the way, which
hopefully you&amp;#8217;ll find interesting.
For example, I comment about
Brazil&amp;#8217;s relationship with open source software / Free software (OSS/FS),
which I found very interesting.
I also try to explain how I ended up helping to document
the complicated inter-relationships between some of the many
OSS/FS Java projects.
&lt;/p&gt;
