&lt;p&gt;
Software and mathematics are often difficult for others to visualize.
Computer hardware engineers can often have cool props to distribute
during their talks, but software developers and mathematicians work
with ideas of the mind - no physical objects involved.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
This can sometimes make it difficult to explain important ideas like
open source software (OSS).
The idea of &amp;#8220;people collaborating to produce something&amp;#8221;
is easy enough, but getting a true visceral understanding of what
happens can be hard.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://gource.io/&quot;&gt;Gource&lt;/a&gt; is a cool visualization tool
that makes it easy to see &amp;#8220;collaboration in action&amp;#8221;.
The Gource project even has a
&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/acaudwell/Gource/wiki/Videos&quot;&gt;web page
showing some examples of Gource visualization&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I recently created a
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XC1g8FmFcUU&quot;&gt;Gource visualization
of the Metamath set.mm project&lt;/a&gt;.
Some context is important here.
In mathematics, claims are supposed to be rigorously proven, but
humans are fallible; they make mistakes, and others often miss those mistakes.
The solution to this problem is to rigorously describe mathematics
in a formal way so that
every step can be rigorously and automatically checked by a computer.
This turns out to be difficult, and requires that a lot of people
work together.
Now&amp;#8230; how can you visualize people working together to rigorously
prove mathematical claims?
One way is to use Gource&amp;#8230; because while it doesn&amp;#8217;t show everything, you
at least get a sense of the collaboration.
In this case, 48 people have contributed so far.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
This visualization shows a common feature: in many cases, a single
person starts and makes all the contributions for a while.
The same thing happens if you view, for example, a
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNBtDstOTmA&quot;&gt;Gource visualization
of the Python programming language&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://gource.io/&quot;&gt;Gource&lt;/a&gt; is itself OSS, so you can download it
and use it to create your own visualizations.
I strongly recommend that you automate doing it as much as possible.
For example, if you process data first, use a script to automate processing
the data.
You&amp;#8217;ll need to give Gource various options;
store options in its config file or a scripts.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
If you create a Gource video, I &lt;i&gt;strongly&lt;/i&gt; recommend adding some music
or at least an audio commentary.
If you add music, make sure it&amp;#8217;s legal to add;
the safe route is to use music released under open licenses such as
&lt;a href=&quot;https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/&quot;&gt;Creative Commons
Attribution (CC-BY)&lt;/a&gt; or
&lt;a href=&quot;https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/&quot;&gt;CC0
Public Domain Dedication (CC0)&lt;/a&gt;.
Beware of the &amp;#8220;non-commercial use&amp;#8221; licenses - your releases might count
as &amp;#8220;commercial&amp;#8221; even if you don&amp;#8217;t think they do (talk to a lawyer if
you want to go down that path).
A great place to start for Gource music is
&lt;a href=&quot;https://audionautix.com/&quot;&gt;audionautix.com&lt;/a&gt;,
which has released lots of music under the
Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported License;
you can select from lots of different styles and get some great options.

&gt;Improving Gource Videos with Background and Audio&lt;/a&gt;
has some tips and instructions.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
In conclusion: enjoy my
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XC1g8FmFcUU&quot;&gt;Gource visualization
of the Metamath set.mm project&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#8230; and perhaps
it will inspire you to do something similar.
I&amp;#8217;ve embedded the video below so you can easily view it (if you like):
