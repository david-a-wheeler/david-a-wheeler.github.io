<p>
GitHub just made a change that I think will make a big improvement
to the security of open source software (OSS).  It’s now possible to
<i>privately</i> report vulnerabilities to OSS projects on GitHub
via
<a href="https://github.blog/changelog/2019-05-23-maintainer-security-advisories">maintainer security advisories</a>!
This wasn’t possible before, and you can
blame me (in part), because I&#8217;m the one who got this ball rolling.
I also want to give a big <i>congrats</i> to the GitHub team,
who actually made it happen.
</p>

<p>
Here some details, in case you&#8217;re curious.
</p>

<p>
As you probably know, there are more OSS projects on GitHub than any other
hosting service.
However, there has been no way to privately report
security vulnerabilities on OSS projects.  It’s hard to fault GitHub
too much (they’re providing a service for free!), yet because so much
software is maintained on GitHub this has led to widespread problems
in reporting and handling vulnerabilities.  It can be worked around,
but this has been a long-standing systemic problem with GitHub.
</p>

<p>
Why is this a problem?  In a word: attackers.
Ideally software would have no defects, including vulnerabilities.
Since vulnerabilities can harm users,
developers should certainly be using a variety of techniques to limit the
number and impact of vulnerabilities in the software they develop
If you&#8217;re developing OSS, a great way to see if you&#8217;re doing that
(and show others the same) is to get a
<a href="https://bestpractices.coreinfrastructure.org/">CII
Best Practices badge</a> from the Linux Foundation&#8217;s
Core Infrastructure Initiative (I lead this effort).
But mistakes sometimes happen, no matter what you do, so you need to
be prepared for them.
It&#8217;s hard to respond to vulnerability reports if it&#8217;s hard to
get the vulnerability reports or discuss them within a project.
Of course, a project needs to rapidly <i>fix</i> a vulnerability once it
is reported, but we need to make that first step easy.
</p>

<p>
In September 2018 I went to a meeting at Harvard to discuss OSS security
(in support of the Linux Foundation).  There I met Devon Zuegel, who was
helping Microsoft with their recently-announced acquisition of GitHub.
I explained the problem to her, and she agreed that this was a problem
that needed to be fixed. She shared it with Nat Friedman (who was
expected to become the GitHub CEO), who also agreed that it made sense.
They couldn’t do anything until after the acquisition was complete,
but they planned to make that change once the acquisition was complete.
The acquisition did complete, so the obvious question is, did they
make the change? Well&#8230;
</p>

<p>
I am very happy to report that GitHub has just announced
the beta release of
<a href="https://github.blog/changelog/2019-05-23-maintainer-security-advisories">maintainer security advisories</a>,
which allow people to privately report vulnerabilities without
immediately alerting every attacker out there.
My sincere thanks to
Devon Zuegel, Nat Friedman, and the entire team of developers at GitHub
for making this happen.
</p>

<p>
This seems to be part of a larger effort by GitHub
to support security (including for OSS).
<a href="https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-security-alerts-for-vulnerable-dependencies">GitHub&#8217;s security alerts</a>
make it easy for GitHub-hosted projects to learn about
vulnerable dependencies (that is, a version of a
software component that you depend on but is vulnerable).
</p>

<p>
It&#8217;s easy to get discouraged about software security, because
the vulnerabilities keep happening.
Part of the problem is that most
software developers know very little about developing secure software.
After all, almost no one is teaching them how to do it
(<a href="https://dwheeler.com/secure-class">I teach a graduate class
at George Mason University to try to counter that problem</a>).
I hope that over time more developers <i>will</i> learn how to do it.
I also hope that more and more developers will use more and more
tools will help them create secure software, such as my
<a href="https://dwheeler.com/flawfinder/">flawfinder</a> and
<a href="https://railroader.org/">Railroader</a> tools.
Tools can&#8217;t replace knowledge, but they are a necessary piece of the puzzle;
putting tools into a CI/CD pipeline (and an auditing process if you
can afford one) can eliminate a vast number of problems.
</p>

<p>
These changes show that it <i>is</i> possible to make
systemic changes to improve security.
Let&#8217;s keep at it!

<h1>Fri, 10 May 2019</h1>
<p><a name="linux-desktop"><font size="+2"><b>The year of Linux on the desktop</b></font></a></p><p></p>
<p>
For those who know their computer history, wild things are going on
regarding Linux this year.
</p>
<p>
Linux is already in widespread use.
For years
<a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/266136/global-market-share-held-by-smartphone-operating-systems/">the vast majority of smartphones run Android</a>, and Android runs on Linux,
so most smartphones run on Linux.
<a href="https://www.top500.org/statistics/details/osfam/1">As of November 2018
100% of all top 500 supercomputers worldwide run on Linux</a>.
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usage_share_of_operating_systems#Market_share_by_category">Best estimates for servers using Linux are around 66.7%</a>,
and Linux is widely used in the cloud and in embedded devices.
</p>
<p>
But something different is going on in 2019.
<a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/all-chromebooks-will-also-be-linux-laptops-going-forward/">All Chromebooks are also going to be
Linux laptops going forward</a>.
<a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/commandline/shipping-a-linux-kernel-with-windows/">Later this year Microsoft will include the Linux kernel as a component in Windows</a>.
In a sense, 2019 is the year of the Linux desktop.
This was not in the way it was envisioned in the past,
but perhaps that&#8217;s what makes it most interesting.
No, it does not mean that everyone is interacting directly with Linux as their
main laptop OS, and so you can certainly argue that this doesn&#8217;t count.
But increasingly that is measurement is less important; people
today access computers via browsers, not the underlying OS, and that
system is often running and/or developed using Linux.
