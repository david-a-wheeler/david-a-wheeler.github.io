&lt;p&gt;
I&amp;#8217;ve kicked off the &lt;a href=&quot;https://railroader.org/&quot;&gt;Railroader&lt;/a&gt;
project to maintain a security static analysis tool for
&lt;a href=&quot;https://rubyonrails.org/&quot;&gt;Ruby on Rails&lt;/a&gt;
that is
&lt;a href=&quot;https://opensource.org/osd-annotated&quot;
&gt;open source software&lt;/a&gt;.
If you are developing with Ruby on Rails, please consider using
&lt;a href=&quot;https://railroader.org/&quot;&gt;Railroader&lt;/a&gt;.
We would also really love contributions, so please contribute!
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
A security static analysis tool (analyzer) examines software
to help you identify vulnerabilities (without running the possibly-vulnerable
program).
This helps you find and fix vulnerabilities &lt;i&gt;before&lt;/i&gt; you field
your web application.
Ruby on Rails is a popular framework for developing web applications;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.netguru.com/blog/top-10-sites-built-with-ruby-on-rails&quot;
&gt;sites that use Rails include
GitHub, Airbnb, Bloomberg, Soundcloud, Groupon, Indiegogo,
Kickstarter, Scribd, MyFitnessPal, Shopify, Urban Dictionary, Twitch.tv&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a href=&quot;https://about.gitlab.com/2018/10/29/why-we-use-rails-to-build-gitlab/&quot;
&gt;GitLab&lt;/a&gt;,
and the
&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/coreinfrastructure/best-practices-badge&quot;
&gt;Core Infrastructure Initiative (CII) Best Practices Badge&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
In the past the obvious tool for this purpose was
&lt;a href=&quot;https://brakemanscanner.org/&quot;
&gt;Brakeman&lt;/a&gt;.
However,
&lt;a href=&quot;https://brakemanscanner.org/blog/2018/06/28/brakeman-has-been-acquired-by-synopsys/index.html&quot;
&gt;Brakeman has switched to the
Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 Public License
(CC-BY-NC-SA-4.0)&lt;/a&gt;.
This is not an
&lt;a href=&quot;https://opensource.org/osd-annotated&quot;
&gt;open source software license&lt;/a&gt;
since it cannot be used commercially
(an OSS license cannot discriminate against a field of endeavor).
Similarly, it is not a
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.en.html&quot;&gt;free software
license&lt;/a&gt; (since you cannot run the program as you wish / for any purpose).
You can verify this by looking at the &lt;a
href=&quot;https://brakemanscanner.org/blog/2019/01/17/brakeman-4-dot-4-dot-0-released&quot;
&gt;Brakeman 4.4.0 release announcement&lt;/a&gt;, the
&lt;a href=&quot;https://spdx.org/licenses/&quot;&gt;SPDX license list&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a href=&quot;https://wiki.debian.org/DFSGLicenses#Creative_Commons_Attribution-Non_Commercial-Share_Alike_.28CC-by-nc-sa.29&quot;
&gt;Debian&amp;#8217;s &amp;#8220;The Debian Free Software Guidelines (DFSG)
and Software Licenses&amp;#8221;&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gnu.org/licenses/license-list#CC-BY-NC&quot;
&gt;Various Licenses and Comments about Them (Free Software Foundation)&lt;/a&gt;,
and
&lt;a href=&quot;https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Licensing:Main#Bad_Licenses_3&quot;
&gt;Fedora&amp;#8217;s Licensing:Main (Bad Licenses list)&lt;/a&gt;.
Railroader conitinues using the original licenses:
MIT for code and CC-BY-3.0 for the website.
MIT, of course, is a very well-known and widely-used
open source software license.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
If you are currently using Brakeman,
&lt;b&gt;do not update to Brakeman version 4.4.0 or later&lt;/b&gt; until you
&lt;b&gt;first talk with your lawyer&lt;/b&gt;.
At the very least, if you plan to use newer versions of Brakeman,
check their new license &lt;i&gt;carefully&lt;/i&gt; to make sure that there
is no possibility of a legal issue.
This license change was part of a purchase of Brakeman by Synopsys.
Synopsys is a big company, and they definitely
have the resources to sue people who don&amp;#8217;t obey their legal terms.
Even if they didn&amp;#8217;t, it is not okay to use software
when you don&amp;#8217;t have the right to do so.
Either make sure that you have no legal issues&amp;#8230; or just switch
to Railroader, where nothing has changed.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Unfortunately,
it is really easy to &amp;#8220;just upgrade to the latest release&amp;#8221;
of Brakeman
without realizing that this is a &lt;i&gt;major&lt;/i&gt; license change.
I suspect a lot of people will just automatically download and run
the latest version, and have no idea that this is happening.
I only noticed because I routinely use software license checkers
(&lt;tt&gt;license_finder&lt;/tt&gt; in my case) so that I immediately notice
license changes in a newer version.
I strongly recommend adding static source code analyzers &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt;
license checkers as part of your continuous integration (CI).
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
We assume that &amp;#8220;Brakeman&amp;#8221; is now a trademarked by Synopsys, Inc,
so we&amp;#8217;ve tried to rename everything so that the projects
are clearly distinct. If we&amp;#8217;ve missed something,
please let us know and we&amp;#8217;ll fix it. The term &amp;#8220;Railroader&amp;#8221; is a
play on the word Rails, but it is obviously a completely different word.
Railroader shares a common code base historically with Brakeman,
and that&amp;#8217;s important to explain, but they are not the same projects and
we are expressly trying to not infringe on any Brakeman trademark.
It&amp;#8217;s obviously legal to copy and modify materials licensed under the
MIT and CC-BY-3.0 licenses
(that&amp;#8217;s the purpose of these licenses), so we believe there is no
legal problem.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I think I have a reasonable background for starting this project.
I created and maintain &lt;a href=&quot;https://dwheeler.com/flawfinder&quot;
&gt;flawfinder&lt;/a&gt;, a security static analysis tool for C/C++,
since 2001.
I literally wrote the book on developing secure software; see my book
&lt;a href=&quot;https://dwheeler.com/secure-programs/&quot;
&gt;&lt;i&gt;Secure Programming HOWTO&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.
I even &lt;a href=&quot;https://dwheeler.com/secure-class/&quot;
&gt;teach a graduate class at George Mason Univerity (GMU) on
how to develop secure software&lt;/a&gt;.
For an example of how I approach securing software
in an affordable way, see my video
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a5D4d6hcEY&quot;
&gt;&lt;i&gt;How to Develop Secure Applications: The BadgeApp Example&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
(2017-09-18) or the related document
&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/coreinfrastructure/best-practices-badge/blob/master/doc/security.md&quot;
&gt;BadgeApp Security: Its Assurance Case&lt;/a&gt;.
I have also long analyzed software licenses, e.g., see
&lt;a href=&quot;https://dwheeler.com/essays/floss-license-slide.html&quot;
&gt;The Free-Libre / Open Source Software (FLOSS) License Slide&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a href=&quot;https://dwheeler.com/essays/commercial-floss.html&quot;
&gt;Free-Libre / Open Source Software (FLOSS) is Commercial Software&lt;/a&gt;, and
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.csiac.org/journal-article/publicly-releasing-open-source-software-developed-for-the-u-s-government/&quot;
&gt;Publicly Releasing Open Source Software Developed for the U.S. Government&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
While Railroader is a project fork, we hope that this is not a hosttile fork.
We will not accept software licensed only under CC-BY-NC-SA-4.0, since
that is not an OSS license. But we&amp;#8217;ll gladly accept good contributions
from anyone if they are released under the original OSS licenses
(MIT for software, CC-BY-3.0 for website content).
If the Brakeman project wants to cooperate in some way, we&amp;#8217;d love to
talk! We are all united in our desire to squash out vulnerabilities
before they are deployed. In addition, we&amp;#8217;re grateful for all the work
that the Brakeman community has done.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
So, again:
If you are developing with Ruby on Rails, please consider using
&lt;a href=&quot;https://railroader.org/&quot;&gt;Railroader&lt;/a&gt;.
We would also really love contributions, so please contribute!
&lt;/p&gt;
