<p>
I&#8217;ve kicked off the <a href="https://railroader.org/">Railroader</a>
project to maintain a security static analysis tool for
<a href="https://rubyonrails.org/">Ruby on Rails</a>
that is
<a href="https://opensource.org/osd-annotated"
>open source software</a>.
If you are developing with Ruby on Rails, please consider using
<a href="https://railroader.org/">Railroader</a>.
We would also really love contributions, so please contribute!
</p>

<p>
A security static analysis tool (analyzer) examines software
to help you identify vulnerabilities (without running the possibly-vulnerable
program).
This helps you find and fix vulnerabilities <i>before</i> you field
your web application.
Ruby on Rails is a popular framework for developing web applications;
<a href="https://www.netguru.com/blog/top-10-sites-built-with-ruby-on-rails"
>sites that use Rails include
GitHub, Airbnb, Bloomberg, Soundcloud, Groupon, Indiegogo,
Kickstarter, Scribd, MyFitnessPal, Shopify, Urban Dictionary, Twitch.tv</a>,
<a href="https://about.gitlab.com/2018/10/29/why-we-use-rails-to-build-gitlab/"
>GitLab</a>,
and the
<a href="https://github.com/coreinfrastructure/best-practices-badge"
>Core Infrastructure Initiative (CII) Best Practices Badge</a>.
</p>

<p>
In the past the obvious tool for this purpose was
<a href="https://brakemanscanner.org/"
>Brakeman</a>.
However,
<a href="https://brakemanscanner.org/blog/2018/06/28/brakeman-has-been-acquired-by-synopsys/index.html"
>Brakeman has switched to the
Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 Public License
(CC-BY-NC-SA-4.0)</a>.
This is not an
<a href="https://opensource.org/osd-annotated"
>open source software license</a>
since it cannot be used commercially
(an OSS license cannot discriminate against a field of endeavor).
Similarly, it is not a
<a href="https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.en.html">free software
license</a> (since you cannot run the program as you wish / for any purpose).
You can verify this by looking at the <a
href="https://brakemanscanner.org/blog/2019/01/17/brakeman-4-dot-4-dot-0-released"
>Brakeman 4.4.0 release announcement</a>, the
<a href="https://spdx.org/licenses/">SPDX license list</a>,
<a href="https://wiki.debian.org/DFSGLicenses#Creative_Commons_Attribution-Non_Commercial-Share_Alike_.28CC-by-nc-sa.29"
>Debian&#8217;s &#8220;The Debian Free Software Guidelines (DFSG)
and Software Licenses&#8221;</a>,
<a href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/license-list#CC-BY-NC"
>Various Licenses and Comments about Them (Free Software Foundation)</a>,
and
<a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Licensing:Main#Bad_Licenses_3"
>Fedora&#8217;s Licensing:Main (Bad Licenses list)</a>.
Railroader conitinues using the original licenses:
MIT for code and CC-BY-3.0 for the website.
MIT, of course, is a very well-known and widely-used
open source software license.
</p>

<p>
If you are currently using Brakeman,
<b>do not update to Brakeman version 4.4.0 or later</b> until you
<b>first talk with your lawyer</b>.
At the very least, if you plan to use newer versions of Brakeman,
check their new license <i>carefully</i> to make sure that there
is no possibility of a legal issue.
This license change was part of a purchase of Brakeman by Synopsys.
Synopsys is a big company, and they definitely
have the resources to sue people who don&#8217;t obey their legal terms.
Even if they didn&#8217;t, it is not okay to use software
when you don&#8217;t have the right to do so.
Either make sure that you have no legal issues&#8230; or just switch
to Railroader, where nothing has changed.
</p>

<p>
Unfortunately,
it is really easy to &#8220;just upgrade to the latest release&#8221;
of Brakeman
without realizing that this is a <i>major</i> license change.
I suspect a lot of people will just automatically download and run
the latest version, and have no idea that this is happening.
I only noticed because I routinely use software license checkers
(<tt>license_finder</tt> in my case) so that I immediately notice
license changes in a newer version.
I strongly recommend adding static source code analyzers <i>and</i>
license checkers as part of your continuous integration (CI).
</p>

<p>
We assume that &#8220;Brakeman&#8221; is now a trademarked by Synopsys, Inc,
so we&#8217;ve tried to rename everything so that the projects
are clearly distinct. If we&#8217;ve missed something,
please let us know and we&#8217;ll fix it. The term &#8220;Railroader&#8221; is a
play on the word Rails, but it is obviously a completely different word.
Railroader shares a common code base historically with Brakeman,
and that&#8217;s important to explain, but they are not the same projects and
we are expressly trying to not infringe on any Brakeman trademark.
It&#8217;s obviously legal to copy and modify materials licensed under the
MIT and CC-BY-3.0 licenses
(that&#8217;s the purpose of these licenses), so we believe there is no
legal problem.
</p>

<p>
I think I have a reasonable background for starting this project.
I created and maintain <a href="https://dwheeler.com/flawfinder"
>flawfinder</a>, a security static analysis tool for C/C++,
since 2001.
I literally wrote the book on developing secure software; see my book
<a href="https://dwheeler.com/secure-programs/"
><i>Secure Programming HOWTO</i></a>.
I even <a href="https://dwheeler.com/secure-class/"
>teach a graduate class at George Mason Univerity (GMU) on
how to develop secure software</a>.
For an example of how I approach securing software
in an affordable way, see my video
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a5D4d6hcEY"
><i>How to Develop Secure Applications: The BadgeApp Example</i></a>
(2017-09-18) or the related document
<a href="https://github.com/coreinfrastructure/best-practices-badge/blob/master/doc/security.md"
>BadgeApp Security: Its Assurance Case</a>.
I have also long analyzed software licenses, e.g., see
<a href="https://dwheeler.com/essays/floss-license-slide.html"
>The Free-Libre / Open Source Software (FLOSS) License Slide</a>,
<a href="https://dwheeler.com/essays/commercial-floss.html"
>Free-Libre / Open Source Software (FLOSS) is Commercial Software</a>, and
<a href="https://www.csiac.org/journal-article/publicly-releasing-open-source-software-developed-for-the-u-s-government/"
>Publicly Releasing Open Source Software Developed for the U.S. Government</a>.
</p>

<p>
While Railroader is a project fork, we hope that this is not a hosttile fork.
We will not accept software licensed only under CC-BY-NC-SA-4.0, since
that is not an OSS license. But we&#8217;ll gladly accept good contributions
from anyone if they are released under the original OSS licenses
(MIT for software, CC-BY-3.0 for website content).
If the Brakeman project wants to cooperate in some way, we&#8217;d love to
talk! We are all united in our desire to squash out vulnerabilities
before they are deployed. In addition, we&#8217;re grateful for all the work
that the Brakeman community has done.

If you are developing with Ruby on Rails, please consider using

We would also really love contributions, so please contribute!
