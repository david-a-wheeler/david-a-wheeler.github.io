No one thing creates secure software, so you
need to do a set of things to make adequately secure software.
But no one has infinite resources; how can you have confidence
that you are doing the right set?
Many experts (including me) have recommended creating an
<i>assurance case</i> to connect the various approaches together
to an efficient, cohesive whole.
It can be hard to start an assurance case, though, because
there are few public examples.

<p>
So I am pleased to report that you can now freely get my paper
<a href="https://www.ida.org/idamedia/Corporate/Files/Publications/IDA_Documents/ITSD/2019/P-9278.pdf"><i>A Sample Security Assurance Case Pattern</i> by David A. Wheeler, December 2018</a>.
This paper discusses how to create secure software by applying an
assurance case, and uses the
<a href="https://github.com/coreinfrastructure/best-practices-badge/blob/master/doc/security.md">Badge Application&#8217;s assurance case</a> as
an example.
If you are trying to create a secure application, I hope you
will find it useful.
