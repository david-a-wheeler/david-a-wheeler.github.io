<p>
No one thing creates secure software, so you
need to do a set of things to make adequately secure software.
But no one has infinite resources; how can you have confidence
that you are doing the right set?
Many experts (including me) have recommended creating an
<i>assurance case</i> to connect the various approaches together
to an efficient, cohesive whole.
It can be hard to start an assurance case, though, because
there are few public examples.
</p>

<p>
So I am pleased to report that you can now freely get my paper
<a href="https://www.ida.org/idamedia/Corporate/Files/Publications/IDA_Documents/ITSD/2019/P-9278.pdf"><i>A Sample Security Assurance Case Pattern</i> by David A. Wheeler, December 2018</a>.
This paper discusses how to create secure software by applying an
assurance case, and uses the
<a href="https://github.com/coreinfrastructure/best-practices-badge/blob/master/doc/security.md">Badge Application&#8217;s assurance case</a> as
an example.
If you are trying to create a secure application, I hope you
will find it useful.

<p><a name="dont-use-iso-14977-ebnf"><font size="+2"><b>Don’t Use ISO/IEC 14977 Extended Backus-Naur Form (EBNF)</b></font></a></p><p></p>
<p>
Sometimes people want to do something, find a standard, and do
not realize the downsides of using that standard.
I have an essay in that genre titled
<a href="/essays/dont-use-iso-14977-ebnf.html"
>Don’t Use ISO/IEC 14977 Extended Backus-Naur Form (EBNF)</a>.
The problem is that although there is a ISO/IEC 14977:1996 specification,
in most cases you should not use it.
If you have to write a specification for a programming language
or complex data structure, please take a look at why I think that!
