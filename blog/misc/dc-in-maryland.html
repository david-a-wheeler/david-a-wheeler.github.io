The U.S. has encouraged democracy abroad through the years.
Yet due to strange quirks of history, residents of the U.S. capital &#8212;
Washington, DC &#8212; cannot vote in U.S. Congressional elections.
That is, simply put, absurd.
I&#8217;m a big believer in democracy, and this is a quirk that needs fixing.
Several solutions have been proposed, but I think one solution
in particular stands above the rest and hasn&#8217;t gotten the
attention it deserves.
What&#8217;s that solution?
