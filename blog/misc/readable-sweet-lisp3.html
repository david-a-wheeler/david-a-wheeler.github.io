<a href="http://www.dwheeler.com/blog/2006/06/17/#readable-sweet-lisp">
Back in 2006 I posted my basic ideas about &#8220;sweet-expressions&#8221;</a>.
Lisp-based programming languages
normally represent programs as <i>s-expressions</i>, and though they are
regular, most people find them hard to read.
I hope to create an alternative to s-expressions that have their
advantages, and not their disadvantages.
You can see more at my
<a href="http://www.dwheeler.com/readable">readable Lisp</a> page.
I&#8217;ve gotten lots of feedback, based on both my prototype of the idea,
as well as on the mailing list discussing it.
</p>

<p>
I&#8217;ve just posted a
<a href="http://www.dwheeler.com/readable/version02.html">a draft of
version 0.2 of sweet-expressions</a>.
This takes that feedback into account, in particular, it&#8217;s now
<i>much</i> more backwards-compatible.
There&#8217;s still a big question about whether or not infix should be a default;
see the page for more details.
</p>

<p>
Here are the improvements over version 0.1:
<ol>
<li>This version is <i>much</i> more compatible with existing Lisp code.
The big change is that
an unprefixed &#8220;(&#8221; immediately calls the underlying s-expression reader.
This way, people can quietly replace their readers with a sweet-reader,
without harming most existing code.
In fact, many implementations could quietly switch to a sweet-reader and
users might not notice until they use the new features.
Instead of using (&#8230;), this uses {..} and [&#8230;] for grouping expressions
without disabling sweet-expressions.
</li>
<li>It can work more cleanly with
macros that provide infix precedence (for those who want precedence rules).
</li>
<li>It extends version 0.1&#8217;s &#8220;name-prefixing&#8221; into &#8220;term-prefixing&#8221;.
This is not only more general, it also makes certain kinds of functional
programming much more pleasant.
</li>
<li>It adds syntax for the common case of accessing maps
(such as indexed or associative arrays) - now a[j] is translated into
(bracketaccess a j).
</li>
<li>Infix default supports arbitrarily-spelled infix operators, and it
automatically accepts &#8220;and&#8221; and &#8220;or&#8221;.
</li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>
Here&#8217;s an example of (ugly) s-expressions:
<pre>
 (defun factorial (n)
   (if (&lt;= n 1)
       1
       (* n (factorial (- n 1)))))
</pre>
</p>

<p>
Here&#8217;s sweet-expressions version 0.1:
<pre>
 defun factorial (n)
   if (n &lt;= 1)
       1
       n * factorial(n - 1)
</pre>
</p>

<p>
Here is sweet-expressions version 0.2 (draft), with infix default
(it figures out when you have an infix operation from the spelling of the
operation):
<pre>
 defun factorial (n)
   if {n &lt;= 1}
       1
       n * factorial(n - 1)
</pre>
</p>

<p>
Here is sweet-expressions version 0.2 (draft), with infix non-default
(you <i>must</i> surround every infix operator with {&#8230;}):
<pre>
 defun factorial (n)
   if {n &lt;= 1}
       1
       {n * factorial{n - 1}}
</pre>
</p>
