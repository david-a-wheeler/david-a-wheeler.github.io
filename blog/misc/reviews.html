I read voraciously, and occasionally I&#8217;ve even been known to see a movie.
So I&#8217;ve started to write down
<a href="http://www.dwheeler.com/reviews.html">Reviews of
Books, Movies and Other Stuff</a>.
There you can see what I think of various books, movies, etc.
It&#8217;s not huge yet, but I intend to make it grow.

In many cases you can click on it to get your own copy via
Amazon.com.  If you buy something that way, I even get a small cut.
I won&#8217;t get rich that way, but if you choose to buy something by doing that,
thanks very much!
