I&#8217;ve been having a great deal of success countering spam
using a simple technique that I call &#8220;email passwords&#8221;.
It&#8217;s been <a href="http://www.dwheeler.com/contactme.html">mentioned
on my website for a long time</a>, but I thought
it might be helpful to others if I gave a more detailed description
of them and how they work.
<p>
As a result, I&#8217;ve just released a short essay titled
<a href="http://www.dwheeler.com/essays/spam-email-password.html">
&#8220;Countering Spam Using Email Passwords&#8221;</a>
which describes email passwords, including how they work
and how to implement them.
The idea is pretty simple: if a stranger wants to contact you,
tell them to include an &#8216;email password&#8217; in the subject line.
Then provide the email password in a shrouded way on your website
so that legitimate senders can get it, but so
it&#8217;s a pain for a spammer to get.
If a spammer gets the email password, you can simply change it.
I also use a &#8220;reply indicator&#8221; text phrase in my replies, so that legitimate
replies are also less likely to be labelled as spam.
But simple isn&#8217;t necessarily bad!
Combined with other anti-spam tricks (like whitelists,
content filters, and blacklists), I get really useful results.
<p>
I suspect other people have done this too, but I haven&#8217;t
seen anything written about email passwords before.
Maybe it&#8217;s in many places and I just missed it; sorry if I have.
Maybe some people will point me to prior work
(I could update my essay to reference some).
But since I&#8217;ve read about many anti-spam approaches without seeing
a discussion of this approach, I suspect others haven&#8217;t heard of this either.
It&#8217;s similar to challenge-response systems, but there&#8217;s no actual challenge.
While it&#8217;s not perfect, it definitely helps.
<p>
In the long term, I believe that governments must step in and
make spamming illegal, with serious legal teeth (including possible
prison terms and financial bankrumptcy)
for the spammer and the people who fund them, as well
as making spamming itself illegal (instead of just fraudulent headers
and spamming after a &#8220;please stop&#8221; message).
Spamming is a massive denial-of-service attack against people&#8217;s
email accounts, and it&#8217;s basically a theft of service.
After all, it doesn&#8217;t matter if you own an email account
if you can&#8217;t use it.
But the history of computer crime law shows that this takes time;
it took a long time for laws to be written to criminalize computer crime,
and it&#8217;s really still in process.
Current laws are completely ineffective (especially the U.S. law),
but that&#8217;s not surprising; lawmakers often try to make small steps in
the hopes that they will solve the problem.
Eventually laws with real teeth
will have to be written, or email will be useless.
Since legislatures like to use email, and have constituents who will
throw them out if their email is taken away, in the long term this will
be addressed.
<p>
But in the short term, we need to use email in spite of inadequate laws.
Approaches like email passwords will hopefully make it possible to
keep using our email until the legislatures around the world
catch up to the technology.
