&lt;p&gt;
I read voraciously, and occasionally I&amp;#8217;ve even been known to see a movie.
So I&amp;#8217;ve started to write down
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dwheeler.com/reviews.html&quot;&gt;Reviews of
Books, Movies and Other Stuff&lt;/a&gt;.
There you can see what I think of various books, movies, etc.
It&amp;#8217;s not huge yet, but I intend to make it grow.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In many cases you can click on it to get your own copy via
Amazon.com.  If you buy something that way, I even get a small cut.
I won&amp;#8217;t get rich that way, but if you choose to buy something by doing that,
thanks very much!
&lt;/p&gt;
