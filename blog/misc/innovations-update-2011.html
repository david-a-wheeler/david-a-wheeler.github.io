<p>
I&#8217;ve made various updates to my list of
<a href="http://www.dwheeler.com/innovation/innovation.html">
The Most Important Software Innovations</a>.
I&#8217;ve added Distributed Version Control System (DVCS);
these are all over now in the form of git, Mercurial (hg),
Bazaar, Monotone, and so on, but
these were influenced by the earlier BitKeeper, which was
in turn influenced by the earlier Teamware (developed by Sun starting in 1991).
As is often the case, &#8220;new&#8221; innovations are actually much older
than people realize.
I also added <i>make</i>, originally developed in 1977, and
quicksort, developed in 1960-1961 by C.A.R. (Tony) Hoare.
I&#8217;ve also improved lots of material that was already there,
such as a better description of the history of
the remote procedure call (RPC).
