<p>
Lisp-based programming languages
normally represent programs as <i>s-expressions</i>,
where an operation and its parameters are surrounded by parentheses.
The operation to be performed is identified first,
and each parameter afterwards is
separated by whitespace.  So the traditional &#8220;2+3&#8221; is written as
&#8220;(+&nbsp;2&nbsp;3)&#8221; instead.
This is regular, but most people find this hard to read.
Here&#8217;s a longer example of an s-expression - notice the many parentheses
and the lack of infix operations:
<pre>
 (defun factorial (n)
   (if (&lt;= n 1)
       1
       (* n (factorial (- n 1)))))
</pre>
</p>

<p>
I think there&#8217;s a small resurging interest in Lisp-based systems, because Lisp
is still very good at &#8220;programs that manipulate programs&#8221;.
The major branches of Lisp (Common Lisp, Scheme, and Emacs Lisp) have
not disappeared, after all.
And I recently encountered a very cool and very new language in development,
<a href="http://www.coyotos.org/docs/bitc/spec.html">BitC</a>.
This language was created to write low-level programs
(e.g., operating system kernels and real-time programs)
that are easy to mathematically <i>prove</i> correct.
I learned about this very cool idea while writing my paper
<a href="http://www.dwheeler.com/essays/high-assurance-floss.html">
High Assurance (for Security or Safety) and
Free-Libre / Open Source Software (FLOSS)&#8230; with Lots on Formal Methods</a>.
BitC combines ideas from Scheme, ML, and C, but it&#8217;s represented using
s-expressions because it&#8217;s easy to manipulate program fragments that way.
I don&#8217;t know how well it&#8217;ll succeed, but it has a good chance;
if nothing else, I don&#8217;t know of <i>anyone</i> who&#8217;s tried this particular
approach.
The program-prover
<a href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/moore/acl2/">ACL2</a> uses
Common Lisp as a basis, for the same reason: program-manipulating programs
are easy.
The FSF backs guile (a Scheme dialect) as their recommended
tool for scripting; guile gives lots of power in a small package.
</p>

<p>
But many software developers avoid Lisp-based languages,
even in cases where they would be a good tool to use, because
most software developers find s-expressions really hard to read.
S-expressions are very regular&#8230; but so is a Turing machine.
They don&#8217;t call it
&#8216;Lots of Irritating Superfluous Parentheses&#8217; for nothing.
Even if you can read it, most developers have to work with others.
Some people like s-expressions as they are - and if so, fine!
But many others are not satisfied with the status quo.
Lots of people have tried to create easier-to-read versions, but
they generally tend to lose the advantages of s-expressions
(such as powerful macro and quoting capabilities).
Can something be done to make it easy to create easier-to-read
code for Lisp-like languages - without spoiling their advantages?
</p>

<p>
I think something can be done, and
I hope to spur a discussion about various options.
To get that started, I&#8217;ve developed my own approach, &#8220;sweet-expressions&#8221;,
which I think is actually a plausible solution.
</p>

<p>
A sweet-expression reader will accept the traditional s-expressions
(except for some pathological cases),
but it also supports various extensions that make it easier to read.
Sweet-expressions are automatically translated into s-expressions, so
they lose no power.
Here&#8217;s how that same program above could be written using sweet-expressions:
<pre>
 defun factorial (n)         ; Parameters can be indented, but need not be
   if (n &lt;= 1)               ; Supports infix, prefix, &amp; function &lt;=(n 1)
       1                     ; This has no parameters, so it's an atom.
       n * factorial(n - 1)  ; Function(...) notation supported
</pre>
</p>

<p>
Sweet-expressions add the following abilities:
<ol>
<li><b>Indentation</b>. Indentation may be used instead
of parentheses to start and end
expressions: any indented line is a parameter of its parent,
later terms on a line are parameters of the first term,
lists of lists are marked with GROUP, and
a function call with 0 parameters is surrounded or followed by a pair of
parentheses [e.g., (pi) and pi()].
A &#8220;(&#8221; disables indentation until its matching &#8220;)&#8221;.
Blank lines at the beginning of a new expression are ignored.
A term that begins at the left edge and is immediately followed by newline
is immediately executed, to make interactive use pleasant.
<li><b>Name-ending</b>. Terms of the form &#8216;NAME(x y&#8230;)&#8217;, with no whitespace before
&#8216;(&#8217;, are interpreted as &#8216;(NAME x y&#8230;)&#8217;;.
Parameters are space-separated inside.
If its content is an infix expression, it&#8217;s considered one parameter instead
(so f(2 + 3) passes the its parameter, 5, to f).
<li><b>Infix</b>.  Optionally,
expressions are automatically interpreted as infix
if their second parameter is an infix operator
(by matching an &#8220;infix operator&#8221; pattern of symbols),
the first parameter is not an infix operator,
and it has at least three parameters.
Otherwise, expressions are interpreted as
normal &#8220;function first&#8221; prefix notation.
To disable infix interpretation, surround the second parameter with as(&#8230;).
Infix expressions must have an odd number of parameters with the
even ones being binary infix operators.
You must separate each infix operator with whitespace on both sides;
precedence is supported.
Use the &#8220;name-ending&#8221; form for unary operations, e.g., -(x) for &#8220;negate x&#8221;.
Thus &#8220;2 + y * -(x)&#8221; is a valid expression, equivalent to (+ 2 (* y (- x))).
Infix operators must match this pattern (and in Scheme cannot be =&gt;):
<pre>
    [+-\*/&lt;&gt;=&amp;\|\p{Sm}]{1-4}|\:
</pre>
</ol>
</p>

<p>
I call this combination &#8220;sweet-expressions&#8221;,
because by adding syntactic sugar (which are essentially abbreviations),
I hope to create a sweeter result.
</p>

<p>
For more information on sweet-expressions or on making
s-expressions more readable in general, see my website page at
<a href="http://www.dwheeler.com/readable">http://www.dwheeler.com/readable</a>.
For example, I provide a sweet-expression reader in Scheme
(under the MIT license), as well as an indenting pretty-printer in
Common Lisp.
In particular, you can
<a href="http://www.dwheeler.com/readable/readable-s-expressions.html">
see my lengthy paper about why sweet-expressions do what they do, and
some plausible alternatives.</a>
You can also download some other implementation code.
</p>

<p>
I&#8217;ve set up a
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/readable">
SourceForge project named &#8220;readable&#8221;</a> to
discuss options in making s-expressions more readable,
and to distribute open source software to implement them
(unimplemented ideas don&#8217;t go far!).
I will probably need to work on other things for a while, but
since I had this idea, I thought it&#8217;d be a good idea to
write the idea and a quick sample demo of it, so that others could
build on top of it.
There hasn&#8217;t a single place for people to discuss how to make
s-expressions more readable.. so now there is one.
There are a lot of smart people out there; giving like-minded parties
a place to discuss them is likely to produce something good.
