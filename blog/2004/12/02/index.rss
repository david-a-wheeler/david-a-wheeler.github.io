&lt;p&gt;
The Federal Trade Commission (FTC)
and National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)
are considering their options for email authentication as
a technique to partially counter spam.
I recommend that they make two fundamental decisions.
First, FTC and NIST should urge lawmakers to make spam illegal,
so that technological measures will have legal standing.
Authentication has little anti-spam value without it.
Second, FTC and NIST should insist that any anti-spam technical standard
must be implementable by all suppliers of email
infrastructure, both proprietary and open source software.
&lt;p&gt;
This essay responded to a Federal Register request supporting the
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/workshops/e-authentication/&quot;&gt;
&amp;#8220;Email Authentication Summit&amp;#8221; of November 9-10, 2004&lt;/a&gt;.
I sent the original version of this essay on September 27, 2004.
Although it was
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ftc.gov/os/comments/emailauthentication/index.htm&quot;&gt;
publicly posted&lt;/a&gt;,
and quoted in places such as
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.groklaw.net/article.php?story=20041109031629840&amp;query=FTC+Wheeler&quot;&gt;Groklaw&amp;#8217;s FTC Email Authentication Summit article&lt;/a&gt;,
it had various formatting problems, a few minor grammatical
mistakes, and it mentioned only NIST and not the FTC.
This version is much easier to read since I converted it to HTML
and had these minor problems fixed.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So, for those of you who wanted a nicer copy of this essay &amp;#8212; enjoy!
