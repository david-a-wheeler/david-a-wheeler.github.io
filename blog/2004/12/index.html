<b>Secure programmer: Call Components Safely</b></a>.

Here&#8217;s the abstract:
<blockquote>
Application programs typically make calls to other components, such as the
underlying operating system, database systems, reusable libraries, Internet
services (like DNS), Web services, and so on. This article explains how to
prevent attackers from exploiting those calls to other components by
discussing the use of only secure components, passing only valid data, making
sure the data will be correctly interpreted, checking return values and
exceptions, and protecting data as it flows between applications and
components.

<p><a name="securing-windows"><font size="+2"><b>New paper on how to secure Microsoft Windows for home and small business users</b></font></a></p><p></p>
As a security expert, I occasionally get asked by Microsoft Windows
users questions like &#8220;I got this strange error message &#8212; do I have spyware?&#8221;
or &#8220;How do I keep my [Windows] computer secure?&#8221;
Large businesses employ people who secure computer systems as a full-time job,
but that doesn&#8217;t help if you&#8217;re a home or small business user.
&#8220;Small business&#8221; here includes small non-profits, too.
<p>
So, I&#8217;ve posted on my website information on how to secure
your Microsoft Windows system.
It&#8217;s basically a checklist of things you can do to make things better.

<p><a name="email-authentication-ftc"><font size="+2"><b>Comments on Email Authentication for Countering Spam</b></font></a></p><p></p>
<p>
The Federal Trade Commission (FTC)
and National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)
are considering their options for email authentication as
a technique to partially counter spam.
I recommend that they make two fundamental decisions.
First, FTC and NIST should urge lawmakers to make spam illegal,
so that technological measures will have legal standing.
Authentication has little anti-spam value without it.
Second, FTC and NIST should insist that any anti-spam technical standard
must be implementable by all suppliers of email
infrastructure, both proprietary and open source software.
<p>
This essay responded to a Federal Register request supporting the
<a href="http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/workshops/e-authentication/">
&#8220;Email Authentication Summit&#8221; of November 9-10, 2004</a>.
I sent the original version of this essay on September 27, 2004.
Although it was
<a href="http://www.ftc.gov/os/comments/emailauthentication/index.htm">
publicly posted</a>,
and quoted in places such as
<a href="http://www.groklaw.net/article.php?story=20041109031629840&query=FTC+Wheeler">Groklaw&#8217;s FTC Email Authentication Summit article</a>,
it had various formatting problems, a few minor grammatical
mistakes, and it mentioned only NIST and not the FTC.
This version is much easier to read since I converted it to HTML
and had these minor problems fixed.
</p>
<p>
<p>
So, for those of you who wanted a nicer copy of this essay &#8212; enjoy!
