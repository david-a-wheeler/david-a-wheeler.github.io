As I&amp;#8217;ve noted before,
due to strange quirks of history, residents of the U.S. capital &amp;#8212;
Washington, DC &amp;#8212; cannot vote in U.S. Congressional elections.
I&amp;#8217;m a big believer in democracy, and this is a quirk that needs fixing.
I earlier wrote
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dwheeler.com/essays/dc-in-maryland.html&quot;&gt;Treat Washington, DC as Part of Maryland for Congressional Elections&lt;/a&gt;.
to describe what I think is a solution that deserves more consideration.
I&amp;#8217;ve now added to that essay an important way that result could
be obtained: the courts.
This situation wasn&amp;#8217;t established by the U.S. Constitution
(as commonly thought), but by a later 1801 law;
before that time, residents of the current DC land voted as Marylandians.
So, DC residents could bring a suit to the courts, claiming that
the disenfranchisement is unconstitutional.
If the U.S. Supreme Court agrees, then voila &amp;#8212; DC residents can
suddenly vote in Congressional elections, as they did before 1801.
