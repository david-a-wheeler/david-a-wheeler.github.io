On October 27 I&amp;#8217;ll be speaking at the
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mdhitech.org/Calendar/html/412.html&quot;&gt;
Open Source Enterprise Solutions Conference&lt;/a&gt;
in Rockville, Maryland.
This event is put on by the
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mdhitech.org/&quot;&gt;Tech Council of Maryland&lt;/a&gt;.
My topic is security and open source software; those who&amp;#8217;ve
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dwheeler.com/secure-programs&quot;&gt;read my books and
articles&lt;/a&gt; won&amp;#8217;t be terribly surprised by the content.
I debunk extreme views like &amp;#8220;open source is always more secure&amp;#8221; and
&amp;#8220;open source is never more secure,&amp;#8221; for example.
&lt;p&gt;
One surprising thing is how many open source software / Free Software
(OSS/FS) security-related companies and projects
are based in Maryland.
There are quite a number!
They include:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sourcefire.com/&quot;&gt;Sourcefire&lt;/a&gt;,
lead developer of the
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sourcefire.com/snort/snortorg.html&quot;&gt;
most popular network intrusion detection system (IDS)&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.snort.org/&quot;&gt;Snort&lt;/a&gt;.
Snort&amp;#8217;s so popular that many other IDS systems accept its data format.
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bastille-linux.org/&quot;&gt;Bastille Linux&lt;/a&gt;,
an excellent Linux operating system hardening project.
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.owasp.org/&quot;&gt;Open Web Application
Security Project (OWASP)&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.owasp.org/about/contact.html&quot;&gt;headquartered in
Columbia, Maryland&lt;/a&gt; and sponsored by folks such as
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.aspectsecurity.com/&quot;&gt;Aspect Security&lt;/a&gt;.
OWASP publishes a very popular top ten, but they also have tools and
other projects.
&lt;li&gt;
The
&lt;a href=&quot;http://ferret.crhc.uiuc.edu/&quot;&gt;Ferret Security Auditing Toolset&lt;/a&gt;
is a project from the University of Maryland.
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nsa.gov/selinux/&quot;&gt;
Security-Enhanced Linux (SELinux)&lt;/a&gt;, a research project that
added significant new access control capabilities to GNU/Linux
operating systems.
SELinux is now included in several Linux distributions.
&lt;li&gt;
There are many other consulting companies.
I did a quick search of the
&lt;a href=&quot;http://openbsdpl.sourceforge.net/www/support.html&quot;&gt;
companies providing OpenBSD support&lt;/a&gt;, and they included
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.CodefusionIS.com&quot;&gt;
Codefusion Internet Services&lt;/a&gt; of
Cumberland, Maryland,
who provide Unix-based consulting services to
small businesses and organizations, particularly
with *BSD Unix (OpenBSD, FreeBSD) and Linux systems.
&lt;/ul&gt;
My point is that there&amp;#8217;s a &lt;i&gt;lot&lt;/i&gt; going on in Maryland
that combines security with open source software, which is very interesting.
