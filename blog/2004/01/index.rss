Those of you who have been following my website will notice a
brand-new feature&amp;#8230; a blog!  I intend to use this
blog to help people keep track of &amp;#8220;new things&amp;#8221; that happen
on the website, as well as let people hear my latest
ramblings (and find them later).  Each entry will have a
static location, so you can link to it for later reference.
&lt;p&gt;
I&amp;#8217;m not supporting community discussions.  I don&amp;#8217;t have the disk space,
it&amp;#8217;s not clear I have the bandwidth, and most importantly,
that is much more complicated to secure.
