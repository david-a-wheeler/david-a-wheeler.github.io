Those of you who have been following my website will notice a
brand-new feature&#8230; a blog!  I intend to use this
blog to help people keep track of &#8220;new things&#8221; that happen
on the website, as well as let people hear my latest
ramblings (and find them later).  Each entry will have a
static location, so you can link to it for later reference.
<p>
I&#8217;m not supporting community discussions.  I don&#8217;t have the disk space,
it&#8217;s not clear I have the bandwidth, and most importantly,
that is much more complicated to secure.
