The FFII has learned that the
&lt;a href=&quot;http://swpat.ffii.org/news/04/cons0507/index.en.html&quot;&gt;
EU Council of Ministers has decided to ignore the EU Parliment,
and instead plan to
establish a reckless &amp;#8220;patent everything&amp;#8221; approach to software and
business models&lt;/a&gt;.
This is an incredibly bad idea; US experience has shown uncontrolled
patenting is an unmitigated disaster for commerce,
and there&amp;#8217;s no reason for Europe to import &lt;i&gt;bad&lt;/i&gt; ideas.
It&amp;#8217;s also exposing some serious problems with EU governance;
members of the European Parliament across the political spectrum
are condemning this blatant disrespect for democracy in Europe.
&lt;p&gt;
See the &lt;a href=&quot;http://ffii.org&quot;&gt;FFII for more information&lt;/a&gt;,
including a simple example of why patents are bad &amp;#8212; they have
&lt;a href=&quot;http://webshop.ffii.org/&quot;&gt;
a demo web page that would be illegal if these laws were passed&lt;/a&gt;,
because Europe has already granted patents on the idea of a web store, etc.
In the process of gathering information on
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dwheeler.com/innovation&quot;&gt;software innovation&lt;/a&gt;
it became quite clear to me that, while patents may be useful in the
hardware fields they were intended for, patents actually
impede innovation in software and business methods.
Which is why US law originally forbid them (until these laws were
stealthily overturned by patent lawyers), and why most countries
still forbid them.
&lt;p&gt;
I urge Europeans to
&lt;a href=&quot;http://kwiki.ffii.org/SwpDemo0405En&quot;&gt;
get involved - see this FFII page for more information&lt;/a&gt;.
