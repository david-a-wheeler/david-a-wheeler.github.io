For those of you who were trying to reach the website recently &amp;#8212;
sorry about that!
The website was unavailable for a little while.
The problem wasn&amp;#8217;t on the website system itself,
but on a communications link (at the ATM level) to the outside world.
In any case, it&amp;#8217;s obviously been fixed, and hopefully we won&amp;#8217;t
be having that kind of problem again&amp;#8230;. at least for a very long time.
