For those of you who were trying to reach the website recently &amp;#8212;
sorry about that!
The website was unavailable for a little while.
The problem wasn&amp;#8217;t on the website system itself,
but on a communications link (at the ATM level) to the outside world.
In any case, it&amp;#8217;s obviously been fixed, and hopefully we won&amp;#8217;t
be having that kind of problem again&amp;#8230;. at least for a very long time.

    <title>New release of &amp;#8220;Why OSS/FS? Look at the Numbers!&amp;#8221;</title>

I&amp;#8217;ve made a new release of my paper
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dwheeler.com/oss_fs_why.html&quot;&gt;&amp;#8220;Why Open Source Software /
Free Software (OSS/FS)? Look at the Numbers!&amp;#8221;&lt;/a&gt;
This is basically a minor release, with various small additions
and improvements here and there.
Here are some highlights:
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
I&amp;#8217;ve noted the substantial rise in Gecko-based browsers, which in some
ways can be viewed as a flight from the security
problems in Internet Explorer I noted earlier.
I include links to
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.w3schools.com/browsers/browsers_stats.asp&quot;&gt;w3schools&amp;#8217; data&lt;/a&gt;,
for example.
&lt;li&gt;
Regarding innovation, I note that
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.businesswire.com/cgi-bin/f_headline.cgi?bw.091404/242585281&quot;&gt;Torvalds just won an award for innovation from &lt;i&gt;The Economist&lt;/i&gt;
for his work on the OSS/FS Linux kernel&lt;/a&gt;.
I also noted
&lt;a href=&quot;http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&amp;cid=1093&amp;e=6&amp;u=/pcworld/20040824/tc_pcworld/117531&quot;&gt;
an innovation (a virus throttler) that
could NOT be deployed on a proprietary system, but worked well on OSS/FS&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;li&gt;
I noted the
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theregister.co.uk/2004/09/09/ms_capgemini_newham_report&quot;&gt;
controversy&lt;/a&gt; regarding the source of some TCO figures used by Newham.
&lt;li&gt;
I also noted some
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,,1637079,00.asp&quot;&gt;EWeek&lt;/a&gt; and
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.vnunet.com/analysis/1157431&quot;&gt;vnunet&lt;/a&gt; articles
blasting silly overstatements like &amp;#8220;proprietary vendors no longer
sit on vulnerabilities.&amp;#8221;
The reality, of course, is you need to check your suppliers; assume nothing.
&lt;li&gt;
I referenced the new
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.report.cpr.ca.gov/cprrpt/issrec/stops/it/so10.htm&quot;&gt;
State of California report&lt;/a&gt;.
Interestingly enough,  I&amp;#8217;m in the references!
&lt;/ol&gt;

So, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dwheeler.com/oss_fs_why.html&quot;&gt;take a peek
at the paper&lt;/a&gt;.
