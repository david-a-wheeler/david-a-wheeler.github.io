For those of you who were trying to reach the website recently &#8212;
sorry about that!
The website was unavailable for a little while.
The problem wasn&#8217;t on the website system itself,
but on a communications link (at the ATM level) to the outside world.
In any case, it&#8217;s obviously been fixed, and hopefully we won&#8217;t
be having that kind of problem again&#8230;. at least for a very long time.

<p><a name="oss-why-20040919"><font size="+2"><b>New release of &#8220;Why OSS/FS? Look at the Numbers!&#8221;</b></font></a></p><p></p>
I&#8217;ve made a new release of my paper
<a href="http://www.dwheeler.com/oss_fs_why.html">&#8220;Why Open Source Software /
Free Software (OSS/FS)? Look at the Numbers!&#8221;</a>
This is basically a minor release, with various small additions
and improvements here and there.
Here are some highlights:
<ol>
<li>
I&#8217;ve noted the substantial rise in Gecko-based browsers, which in some
ways can be viewed as a flight from the security
problems in Internet Explorer I noted earlier.
I include links to
<a href="http://www.w3schools.com/browsers/browsers_stats.asp">w3schools&#8217; data</a>,
for example.
<li>
Regarding innovation, I note that
<a href="http://www.businesswire.com/cgi-bin/f_headline.cgi?bw.091404/242585281">Torvalds just won an award for innovation from <i>The Economist</i>
for his work on the OSS/FS Linux kernel</a>.
I also noted
<a href="http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&cid=1093&e=6&u=/pcworld/20040824/tc_pcworld/117531">
an innovation (a virus throttler) that
could NOT be deployed on a proprietary system, but worked well on OSS/FS</a>.
<li>
I noted the
<a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2004/09/09/ms_capgemini_newham_report">
controversy</a> regarding the source of some TCO figures used by Newham.
<li>
I also noted some
<a href="http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,,1637079,00.asp">EWeek</a> and
<a href="http://www.vnunet.com/analysis/1157431">vnunet</a> articles
blasting silly overstatements like &#8220;proprietary vendors no longer
sit on vulnerabilities.&#8221;
The reality, of course, is you need to check your suppliers; assume nothing.
<li>
I referenced the new
<a href="http://www.report.cpr.ca.gov/cprrpt/issrec/stops/it/so10.htm">
State of California report</a>.
Interestingly enough,  I&#8217;m in the references!
</ol>

So, <a href="http://www.dwheeler.com/oss_fs_why.html">take a peek
at the paper</a>.
