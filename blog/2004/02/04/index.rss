Well, I&amp;#8217;m happy to announce that
my fourth developerworks article on secure development is
now out for the public.
Go take a look at
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www-106.ibm.com/developerworks/linux/library/l-sp4.html&quot;&gt;
Secure programmer: Countering buffer overflows&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;p&gt;
The world is littered with buffer overflow articles, but I didn&amp;#8217;t
feel I could really write a good series on writing secure software
without covering the topic.
My goal was to discuss well-trodden ground while keeping it interesting
and trying to bring in new material; hopefully I&amp;#8217;ve succeeded at both.
I suspect that a lot of developers know vaguely about buffer overflows,
but haven&amp;#8217;t heard about some of the interesting research to counter them
that are finally getting out to the field.
If you&amp;#8217;re one of those people, you&amp;#8217;ll still probably find it interesting.
&lt;p&gt;
My goal in all this is to get developers to understand how to write
secure programs.
If at some developers learn from this stuff, and avoid some
old problems, I&amp;#8217;ve have succeeded.
