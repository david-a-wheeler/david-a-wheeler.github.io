I&#8217;ve just revised my paper
<a href="http://www.dwheeler.com/essays/gpl-compatible.html">
Make Your Open Source Software GPL-Compatible. Or Else</a>.
Among other things, the new version notes the interesting
events surrounding Apache and XFree86.
<p>
Apache has changed their license, claiming they&#8217;re now
GPL-compatible; the FSF doesn&#8217;t agree that it&#8217;s compatible.
Regardless of which version the courts will agree on, it&#8217;s
clear that some people who deal with Apache&#8217;s license agree
that GPL compatibility is important.
<p>
The XFree86 situation is even more muddled.
David Dawes of XFree86 plans to change the XFree86 code license
to be GPL-incompatible, and that&#8217;s started a firestorm.
<p>
I continue to use the original title, which only uses the term
&#8220;Open Source Software&#8221; (OSS) instead of &#8220;OSS/FS&#8221;.
The real reason for the original title is that when I submitted
this to OsOpinion, they had strict size limits that I needed to
adhere to.
Although OsOpinion is no more (and only my copy survives), it&#8217;s still
helpful for searchers to keep the same title.
Besides, those who prefer the term &#8220;Free Software&#8221; don&#8217;t really need
this explanation; people who use the term &#8220;Free Software&#8221; and intentionally
use GPL-incompatible licenses are rare indeed, and almost always
consider the ramifications of their decisions.
This essay is aimed at those who have <i>not</i> fully considered the
ramifications of choosing a GPL-incompatible license.
