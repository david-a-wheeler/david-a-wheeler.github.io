<p><a name="new-government-oss"><font size="+2"><b>New presentation on Government and OSS/FS (LinuxWorld 2004, eGov)</b></font></a></p><p></p>
I&#8217;ve just posted a new presentation,
<a href="http://www.dwheeler.com/government_oss.pdf">What Should
Governments Examine in Acquiring COTS Open Source Software (OSS)?</a>
This is the presentation I gave at
LinuxWorld on January 22, 2004 (with a few tweaks).
LinuxWorld was in New York City&#8217;s Javits center, and many U.S. government
folks weren&#8217;t there.
So, I&#8217;m also going to be giving the same presentation
on February 3, 2004, at the
<a href="http://www.e-gov.com/events/2004/we_gov/conference">Web-enabled
Government conference</a> in Washington, DC (at the Ronald Reagan building).
In both cases this presentation is part of a set of short presentations
by panel members, followed by a panel question and answer period.
If you&#8217;re curious, the other panelists include
Tony Stanco (George Washington University), Terry Bollinger (MITRE),
and Peter Gallagher (devIS).
If you&#8217;re not curious, I can&#8217;t help you.
<p>
This presentation is pretty short; it has to be, since each of
us has only has 10 minutes to give our initial presentation.
So much information had to be kept out to fit in 10 minutes&#8217; time!!
Still, I think this presentation would be
useful for those who are thinking about
the relationship betwen governments and
open source software / Free Software (OSS/FS).
I talk about in what way OSS/FS is the same as proprietary software,
how OSS/FS is different in terms of its implications,
challenges in employing OSS/FS, and closing remarks.
I think the challenges in particular need more thinking about.
For example, acquisition processes were designed before OSS/FS was common;
it&#8217;s easy to unintentionally exclude perfectly good OSS/FS options from
consideration.
<p>
This presentation is yet another example of a minor terminology problem.
I normally use &#8220;OSS/FS&#8221; in my writing, as a broad term covering the
definitions of both open source software (as defined by OSI)
and Free Software (as defined by the FSF).
However, &#8220;OSS/FS&#8221; is a complicated thing to say.
In this briefing, I just use the term &#8220;OSS&#8221;; for this audience,
that works reasonably well.
However, some seem to think that this term
excludes &#8220;Free Software&#8221; (I don&#8217;t mean to), and
for some government types this term is slightly confusing
(since &#8220;open source&#8221; in governmentese means &#8220;available to the public&#8221;).
I&#8217;m thinking about starting to use the term
&#8220;FLOSS&#8221; (Free-Libre / Open Source Software), since FLOSS is easier to
say and deals with the problem that to many, &#8220;free software&#8221; means
&#8220;free of cost&#8221; and not the intended &#8220;freedoms provided&#8221;.
F/OSS (Free / Open Source Software)
is also easy to say, but that phrase leaves the second problem untouched.
It&#8217;d be far too much of a hassle to change my current documents, though.
Since FLOSS has &#8220;open source software&#8221; embedded in it, people searching
for &#8220;open source software&#8221; could at least still find it.
<p>
One last-minute addition to the presentation is a set of web sites
that might be of special interest to someone examining the issue of
government and open source software.
I&#8217;ve listed as interesting papers my own
<a href="http://www.dwheeler.com/oss_fs_why.html">Why OSS/FS?
Look at the Numbers!</a> paper,
the MITRE &#8220;Use of Free and Open Source Software in the US Dept. of Defense&#8221;,
the President&#8217;s Information Technology Advisory Committee (PITAC) - Panel
on Open Source Software for High End Computing, and the
DoD policy memo &#8220;Open Source Software (OSS) in the DoD&#8221; signed by
John P. Stenbit (DoD Chief Information Officer) on May 28, 2003.
Interesting sites include the
<a href="http://www.egovos.org">Center of Open Source and Government
(eGovOS)</a>, <a href="http://opensector.org">OpenSector.org</a>,
and
the <a href="http://www.osaia.org">Open Source and Industry Alliance</a>.
And of course, the
<a href="http://www.opensource.org">Open Source Initiative (OSI)</a>
and
<a href="http://www.fsf.org">Free Software Foundation (FSF)</a>.
Obviously there are many other potentially interesting sites and papers;
a longer list is in my list of
<a href="http://www.dwheeler.com/oss_fs_refs.html">OSS/FS references</a>.
<p>
Note that, as with all things on my personal site, this
presentation is not formally endorsed by my employer, government,
or guinea pig.  I&#8217;ll work on the guinea pig.
