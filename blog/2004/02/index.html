Today Slashdot posted
<a href="http://books.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=04/02/21/228241">
my review of David J. Agan&#8217;s <i>Debugging:
The 9 Indispensable Rules for Finding Even the Most Elusive Software
and Hardware Problems.</i></a>
The bottom line: it&#8217;s a really good book.
<i>Debugging</i> explains the fundamentals of finding and
fixing bugs (once a bug has been detected),
rather than any particular technology.
It&#8217;s best for developers who are novices or who are only
moderately experienced,
but even old pros will find helpful reminders of things they
know they should do but forget in the rush of the moment.

<p><a name="scm1"><font size="+2"><b>New: Comments on Software Configuration Management (SCM) Systems</b></font></a></p><p></p>
I&#8217;ve just posted a new essay,
<a href="http://www.dwheeler.com/essays/scm.html">
Comments on Software Configuration Management (SCM) Systems</a>.
It primarily compares CVS, Subversion, and GNU arch.
If you need a way to manage software development,
there&#8217;s lots of interesting stuff going on; take a look.

<p><a name="apache-xfree86"><font size="+2"><b>Modified &#8220;GPL-Compatible. Or Else&#8221; noting Apache and XFree86</b></font></a></p><p></p>

I&#8217;ve just revised my paper
<a href="http://www.dwheeler.com/essays/gpl-compatible.html">
Make Your Open Source Software GPL-Compatible. Or Else</a>.
Among other things, the new version notes the interesting
events surrounding Apache and XFree86.
<p>
Apache has changed their license, claiming they&#8217;re now
GPL-compatible; the FSF doesn&#8217;t agree that it&#8217;s compatible.
Regardless of which version the courts will agree on, it&#8217;s
clear that some people who deal with Apache&#8217;s license agree
that GPL compatibility is important.
<p>
The XFree86 situation is even more muddled.
David Dawes of XFree86 plans to change the XFree86 code license
to be GPL-incompatible, and that&#8217;s started a firestorm.
<p>
I continue to use the original title, which only uses the term
&#8220;Open Source Software&#8221; (OSS) instead of &#8220;OSS/FS&#8221;.
The real reason for the original title is that when I submitted
this to OsOpinion, they had strict size limits that I needed to
adhere to.
Although OsOpinion is no more (and only my copy survives), it&#8217;s still
helpful for searchers to keep the same title.
Besides, those who prefer the term &#8220;Free Software&#8221; don&#8217;t really need
this explanation; people who use the term &#8220;Free Software&#8221; and intentionally
use GPL-incompatible licenses are rare indeed, and almost always
consider the ramifications of their decisions.
This essay is aimed at those who have <i>not</i> fully considered the
ramifications of choosing a GPL-incompatible license.

<p><a name="homepage-reorg"><font size="+2"><b>Reorganizing the home page</b></font></a></p><p></p>
I now have so much information on my website that I decided
a little reorganization was necessary.  Hopefully, you&#8217;ll
like the new look and find it more helpful.
<p>
The main thing I&#8217;ve done is
put the various links in multiple columns, so that more will
fit on the screen or on paper.  Also, I&#8217;ve added a way to
quickly search this site for information (it uses Google).
<p>
I&#8217;m not done; I intend to soon add above the search capability
a set of items like this:
<pre>
My Blog | About Site | About Me | Contact Me
</pre>
<p>
The home page is now automatically generated; I use
a self-created XSLT script to extract the most recent blog entries
(from /blog/index.rss), and use sed to update the front page with them.

<p><a name="article4"><font size="+2"><b>Security Article 4 - Buffer Overflows</b></font></a></p><p></p>
Well, I&#8217;m happy to announce that
my fourth developerworks article on secure development is
now out for the public.
Go take a look at
<a href="http://www-106.ibm.com/developerworks/linux/library/l-sp4.html">
Secure programmer: Countering buffer overflows</a>.
<p>
The world is littered with buffer overflow articles, but I didn&#8217;t
feel I could really write a good series on writing secure software
without covering the topic.
My goal was to discuss well-trodden ground while keeping it interesting
and trying to bring in new material; hopefully I&#8217;ve succeeded at both.
I suspect that a lot of developers know vaguely about buffer overflows,
but haven&#8217;t heard about some of the interesting research to counter them
that are finally getting out to the field.
If you&#8217;re one of those people, you&#8217;ll still probably find it interesting.
<p>
My goal in all this is to get developers to understand how to write
secure programs.
If at some developers learn from this stuff, and avoid some
old problems, I&#8217;ve have succeeded.

<p><a name="new-government-oss"><font size="+2"><b>New presentation on Government and OSS/FS (LinuxWorld 2004, eGov)</b></font></a></p><p></p>
I&#8217;ve just posted a new presentation,
<a href="http://www.dwheeler.com/government_oss.pdf">What Should
Governments Examine in Acquiring COTS Open Source Software (OSS)?</a>
This is the presentation I gave at
LinuxWorld on January 22, 2004 (with a few tweaks).
LinuxWorld was in New York City&#8217;s Javits center, and many U.S. government
folks weren&#8217;t there.
So, I&#8217;m also going to be giving the same presentation
on February 3, 2004, at the
<a href="http://www.e-gov.com/events/2004/we_gov/conference">Web-enabled
Government conference</a> in Washington, DC (at the Ronald Reagan building).
In both cases this presentation is part of a set of short presentations
by panel members, followed by a panel question and answer period.
If you&#8217;re curious, the other panelists include
Tony Stanco (George Washington University), Terry Bollinger (MITRE),
and Peter Gallagher (devIS).
If you&#8217;re not curious, I can&#8217;t help you.
<p>
This presentation is pretty short; it has to be, since each of
us has only has 10 minutes to give our initial presentation.
So much information had to be kept out to fit in 10 minutes&#8217; time!!
Still, I think this presentation would be
useful for those who are thinking about
the relationship betwen governments and
open source software / Free Software (OSS/FS).
I talk about in what way OSS/FS is the same as proprietary software,
how OSS/FS is different in terms of its implications,
challenges in employing OSS/FS, and closing remarks.
I think the challenges in particular need more thinking about.
For example, acquisition processes were designed before OSS/FS was common;
it&#8217;s easy to unintentionally exclude perfectly good OSS/FS options from
consideration.
<p>
This presentation is yet another example of a minor terminology problem.
I normally use &#8220;OSS/FS&#8221; in my writing, as a broad term covering the
definitions of both open source software (as defined by OSI)
and Free Software (as defined by the FSF).
However, &#8220;OSS/FS&#8221; is a complicated thing to say.
In this briefing, I just use the term &#8220;OSS&#8221;; for this audience,
that works reasonably well.
However, some seem to think that this term
excludes &#8220;Free Software&#8221; (I don&#8217;t mean to), and
for some government types this term is slightly confusing
(since &#8220;open source&#8221; in governmentese means &#8220;available to the public&#8221;).
I&#8217;m thinking about starting to use the term
&#8220;FLOSS&#8221; (Free-Libre / Open Source Software), since FLOSS is easier to
say and deals with the problem that to many, &#8220;free software&#8221; means
&#8220;free of cost&#8221; and not the intended &#8220;freedoms provided&#8221;.
F/OSS (Free / Open Source Software)
is also easy to say, but that phrase leaves the second problem untouched.
It&#8217;d be far too much of a hassle to change my current documents, though.
Since FLOSS has &#8220;open source software&#8221; embedded in it, people searching
for &#8220;open source software&#8221; could at least still find it.
<p>
One last-minute addition to the presentation is a set of web sites
that might be of special interest to someone examining the issue of
government and open source software.
I&#8217;ve listed as interesting papers my own
<a href="http://www.dwheeler.com/oss_fs_why.html">Why OSS/FS?
Look at the Numbers!</a> paper,
the MITRE &#8220;Use of Free and Open Source Software in the US Dept. of Defense&#8221;,
the President&#8217;s Information Technology Advisory Committee (PITAC) - Panel
on Open Source Software for High End Computing, and the
DoD policy memo &#8220;Open Source Software (OSS) in the DoD&#8221; signed by
John P. Stenbit (DoD Chief Information Officer) on May 28, 2003.
Interesting sites include the
<a href="http://www.egovos.org">Center of Open Source and Government
(eGovOS)</a>, <a href="http://opensector.org">OpenSector.org</a>,
and
the <a href="http://www.osaia.org">Open Source and Industry Alliance</a>.
And of course, the
<a href="http://www.opensource.org">Open Source Initiative (OSI)</a>
and
<a href="http://www.fsf.org">Free Software Foundation (FSF)</a>.
Obviously there are many other potentially interesting sites and papers;
a longer list is in my list of
<a href="http://www.dwheeler.com/oss_fs_refs.html">OSS/FS references</a>.
<p>
Note that, as with all things on my personal site, this
presentation is not formally endorsed by my employer, government,
or guinea pig.  I&#8217;ll work on the guinea pig.
