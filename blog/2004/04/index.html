<p><a name="scm-security1"><font size="+2"><b>Updated my essay on Software Configuration Management Security</b></font></a></p><p></p>
I&#8217;ve updated my essay on
<a href="http://www.dwheeler.com/essays/scm-security.html">Software Configuration Management (SCM) Security</a>.
That essay is relatively new, and I&#8217;ve added more now.
Today we use SCM tools to manage our complicated software,
yet we&#8217;re not paying enough attention to those tools&#8217; security
requirements.
<p>
For example, few SCM tools think about the problem of handling
malicious developers (who are <i>trying</i> to insert Trojan horses) or
about countering people who gain root access on a centralized system
being used as the SCM data repository&#8230; even though that&#8217;s already
happening.
There <i>are</i> ways to deal with those kinds of attacks&#8230; but you
have to think about them to counter them.
<p>
One of the recent additions to the essay
is based on an interesting email I received from
Dr. Carsten Bormann of the University of Bremen.
He mentioned a specialized attack that he terms the
&#8220;encumbrance pollution attack&#8221;.
In an encumberance pollution attack, the attacker inserts material
that cannot be legally included.
<p>
To understand it, first
imagine an SCM with perfectly indestructible history.
The attacker steals developer credentials, or is himself a malicious
developer, and checks in a change that contains some encumbered material.
&#8220;Encumbered&#8221; material is simply material which cannot be legally included.
Examples include child pornography, slanderous/libelous statements, or
code which has copyright or patent encumberances.
This could be very advantageous, for example, a company
might hire a malicious developer to insert that company&#8217;s code into a
competing product, and then sue the competitor for copyright infringement,
knowing that their SCM system &#8220;can&#8217;t&#8221; undo the problem.
Or a lazy programmer might copy code that they have no right to copy
(this is rare in open source software projects, because every line of code
and who provided it is a matter of public record, but it proprietary
projects do have this risk).
<p>
Any SCM can record a change that essentially undoes a previous change,
but if the history is indestructable and viewable by all, then
you can&#8217;t get rid of the history.
This makes your SCM archive irrevocably encumbered.
This can especially be a problem if the SCM is indestructably recording
proposals by outsiders!
<p>
Anyway, take a look at

<p><a name="dc-in-maryland"><font size="+2"><b>Treat Washington, DC as Part of Maryland for Congressional Elections</b></font></a></p><p></p>
The U.S. has encouraged democracy abroad through the years.
Yet due to strange quirks of history, residents of the U.S. capital &#8212;
Washington, DC &#8212; cannot vote in U.S. Congressional elections.
That is, simply put, absurd.
I&#8217;m a big believer in democracy, and this is a quirk that needs fixing.
Several solutions have been proposed, but I think one solution
in particular stands above the rest and hasn&#8217;t gotten the
attention it deserves.
What&#8217;s that solution?
<a href="http://www.dwheeler.com/essays/dc-in-maryland.html">Treat Washington, DC as Part of Maryland for Congressional Elections</a>.

<p><a name="european-patent2004"><font size="+2"><b>Stop European Software Patents</b></font></a></p><p></p>
As you can tell, I&#8217;ve placed a protest on my front page
about the push in Europe to permit software patents.
Patent lawyers are trying to get laws passed to
permit unlimited patenting of software, a foolish idea
that the European Parliment has already rejected.
The <a href="http://ffii.org">ffii.org</a> and other
groups have more information on the topic.
Please get others to stop this thing.

<p><a name="microsoft-tco"><font size="+2"><b>NewsForge interviews me on Proprietary vs. OSS/FS TCO</b></font></a></p><p></p>
<a href="http://software.newsforge.com/software/04/04/02/179211.shtml?tid=132&amp;tid=150&amp;tid=82">
NewsForge has just posted an interview of me, where I discuss
the Microsoft-funded studies claiming that Microsoft&#8217;s proprietary products
have a lower total cost of ownership (TCO) than
Open Source Software/Free Software (OSS/FS)</a>.
<p>
My answers shouldn&#8217;t be surprising to those who&#8217;ve read
my other writings.  For example, I say that:
<blockquote>
&#8220;TCO is extremely sensitive to a specific circumstance, so
a TCO for one situation doesn&#8217;t usually apply to other cases.
I&#8217;m sure that there are cases where Microsoft&#8217;s approach has
a lower TCO than alternatives, so in those specific cases it&#8217;s true.
However, there are also cases where open source software or
Linux-based solutions have a lower TCO.
You really have to consider all the costs for your specific situation,
and your results may differ.&#8221;
</blockquote>
<p>
I don&#8217;t have a lot of faith in Microsoft&#8217;s studies,
because Microsoft funded almost all of them&#8230; a concern I
discuss in the interview.
As I say,
&#8220;There may be useful information in the self-funded studies,
but I don&#8217;t have any way to be confident with them.&#8221;
There are just too many ways for a vendor to tweak studies they fund.
Oh, and I&#8217;d say the same thing about a study funded by Red Hat or IBM or
Apple or anyone else.
You should give much more weight to <i>independent</i> studies.
