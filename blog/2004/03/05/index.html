On March 11, 2004, I&#8217;ll be speaking at the conference
<a href="http://www.governmentevents.ca/fca.html">
You Paid What? A Workshop On Full Cost Accounting Methodology
For Information Technology Projects In The Public Sector</a>
in Ottawa, Canada.
My talk will be based on my paper,
<a href="http://www.dwheeler.com/oss_fs_eval.html">Evaluating
OSS/FS Programs</a>.
<p>
What&#8217;s Full Cost Accounting (FCA)? It&#8217;s the idea that
instead of making information technology purchasing decisions
on the basis of a single-project cash-flow,
you should use a framework (FCA) to assess value-for-money
from an enterprise perspective, and when appropriate,
in consideration of the wider community
(this particular conference is aimed at governments,
which in the end exist to serve the wide community of their citizens).
