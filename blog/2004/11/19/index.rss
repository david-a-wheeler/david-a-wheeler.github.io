I like playing chess, but the effort to memorize enough
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dwheeler.com/chess-openings/&quot;&gt;chess opening moves&lt;/a&gt;
to be just a passable player isn&amp;#8217;t that much fun.
I&amp;#8217;ve enjoyed &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dwheeler.com/essays/Fischer_Random_Chess.html&quot;&gt;
Fischer Random Chess (aka Chess960)&lt;/a&gt;;
it&amp;#8217;s a nice board game, without the endless memorizing.
&lt;p&gt;
But I&amp;#8217;ve also found something new: Arimaa.
Arimaa is a fun board game that you can play using chess pieces, but
it&amp;#8217;s really a completely different game.
Its rules are very simple, much simpler than chess &amp;#8212; kids
can learn the rules in a few minutes.
Yet with those simple rules you end up with
a very strategic and interesting game.
&lt;p&gt;
The &lt;a href=&quot;http://arimaa.com/arimaa/&quot;&gt;official Arimaa web site&lt;/a&gt;
has lots of great stuff - a fancy presentation on how to play,
official rules, and ways to sit down and start playing both computers
and humans right away.
The
&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arimaa&quot;&gt;Wikipedia entry on Arimaa&lt;/a&gt;
has lots of good information, and Wikipedia also has information on
&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arimaa_Tactics&quot;&gt;Arimaa Tactics&lt;/a&gt;
and
&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arimaa_Strategy&quot;&gt;Arimaa Strategy&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;p&gt;
Arimaa was designed to
be hard for computers to play (while being easy for humans), and there&amp;#8217;s
even a prize for a computer that can beat the best human Arimaa players.
Which is an interesting angle, story-wise.
Its creator hopes that by creating better computer players, we might
learn more about computerizing strategy.
If that turns out to happen, I&amp;#8217;ll certainly be interested in those
results.
But either way, it&amp;#8217;s a fun game to play, and that&amp;#8217;s a useful
thing in its own right.
