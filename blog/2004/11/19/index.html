I like playing chess, but the effort to memorize enough
<a href="http://www.dwheeler.com/chess-openings/">chess opening moves</a>
to be just a passable player isn&#8217;t that much fun.
I&#8217;ve enjoyed <a href="http://www.dwheeler.com/essays/Fischer_Random_Chess.html">
Fischer Random Chess (aka Chess960)</a>;
it&#8217;s a nice board game, without the endless memorizing.
<p>
But I&#8217;ve also found something new: Arimaa.
Arimaa is a fun board game that you can play using chess pieces, but
it&#8217;s really a completely different game.
Its rules are very simple, much simpler than chess &#8212; kids
can learn the rules in a few minutes.
Yet with those simple rules you end up with
a very strategic and interesting game.
<p>
The <a href="http://arimaa.com/arimaa/">official Arimaa web site</a>
has lots of great stuff - a fancy presentation on how to play,
official rules, and ways to sit down and start playing both computers
and humans right away.
The
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arimaa">Wikipedia entry on Arimaa</a>
has lots of good information, and Wikipedia also has information on
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arimaa_Tactics">Arimaa Tactics</a>
and
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arimaa_Strategy">Arimaa Strategy</a>.
<p>
Arimaa was designed to
be hard for computers to play (while being easy for humans), and there&#8217;s
even a prize for a computer that can beat the best human Arimaa players.
Which is an interesting angle, story-wise.
Its creator hopes that by creating better computer players, we might
learn more about computerizing strategy.
If that turns out to happen, I&#8217;ll certainly be interested in those
results.
But either way, it&#8217;s a fun game to play, and that&#8217;s a useful
thing in its own right.
