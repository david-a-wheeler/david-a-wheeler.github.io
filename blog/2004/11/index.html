<p><a name="patent-20041123"><font size="+2"><b>Software patents &#8212; keep protesting</b></font></a></p><p></p>
<p>
<a href="http://nosoftwarepatents.com/en/m/intro/app0411.html">
Linus Torvalds (lead developer of the Linux kernel),
Michael Widenius (lead for MySQL) and Rasmus Lerdorf (lead for PHP)
have written an appeal to the EU Council against
software patents in Europe.</a>
This letter is useful as yet another ray of sunlight into
a sea of deceptive practices.  Here&#8217;s what the letter reveals:
&#8220;The draft directive in question is deceptive because it leads laymen, and even
those legal professionals who are not familiar with the intricacies of patent
law, to falsely believe that it would exclude software from patentability.
However, it is actually a compilation of the entirety of the excuses with
which the patent system has, for many years, been circumventing article 52 of
the European Patent Convention in order to grant patents on software ideas.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
I think that the
<a href="http://webshop.ffii.org/">patented webshop</a> in particular
shows why patents have always been excluded from patenting
in Europe (and were originally excluded everywhere, until big money
bought the laws of some countries).
You should also see this
<a href="http://www.ffii.org.uk/ftc/ftc.html">link
to relevant excerpts from the U.S. Federal
Trade Commission Report</a>.
For example:
<blockquote>
Many panelists and participants expressed the view that software
and Internet patents are impeding innovation.
They stated that such patents are impairing follow-on incentives,
increasing entry barriers, creating uncertainty that harms
incentives to invest in innovation, and producing patent thickets.
Panelists discussed how defensive patenting increases the complexity
of patent thickets and forces companies to divert resources from
R&amp;D into obtaining patents.
Commentators noted that patent thickets make it more
difficult to commercialize new products and raise uncertainty
and investment risks. Some panelists also noted that hold-up
has become a problem that can result in higher prices being passed
along to consumers. 
</blockquote>
Note that after discussing the various ways that patents
are intended to spur innovation,
&#8220;Commentators were generally skeptical about the benefits of the
patent system in these [software and Internet] industries.&#8221;

<p><a name="arimaa"><font size="+2"><b>Cool new board game: Arimaa</b></font></a></p><p></p>
I like playing chess, but the effort to memorize enough
<a href="http://www.dwheeler.com/chess-openings/">chess opening moves</a>
to be just a passable player isn&#8217;t that much fun.
I&#8217;ve enjoyed <a href="http://www.dwheeler.com/essays/Fischer_Random_Chess.html">
Fischer Random Chess (aka Chess960)</a>;
it&#8217;s a nice board game, without the endless memorizing.
<p>
But I&#8217;ve also found something new: Arimaa.
Arimaa is a fun board game that you can play using chess pieces, but
it&#8217;s really a completely different game.
Its rules are very simple, much simpler than chess &#8212; kids
can learn the rules in a few minutes.
Yet with those simple rules you end up with
a very strategic and interesting game.
<p>
The <a href="http://arimaa.com/arimaa/">official Arimaa web site</a>
has lots of great stuff - a fancy presentation on how to play,
official rules, and ways to sit down and start playing both computers
and humans right away.
The
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arimaa">Wikipedia entry on Arimaa</a>
has lots of good information, and Wikipedia also has information on
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arimaa_Tactics">Arimaa Tactics</a>
and
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arimaa_Strategy">Arimaa Strategy</a>.
<p>
Arimaa was designed to
be hard for computers to play (while being easy for humans), and there&#8217;s
even a prize for a computer that can beat the best human Arimaa players.
Which is an interesting angle, story-wise.
Its creator hopes that by creating better computer players, we might
learn more about computerizing strategy.
If that turns out to happen, I&#8217;ll certainly be interested in those
results.
But either way, it&#8217;s a fun game to play, and that&#8217;s a useful
thing in its own right.

<p><a name="ham-password"><font size="+2"><b>New Edition: Countering Spam by Using Ham Passwords (Email Passwords)</b></font></a></p><p></p>

I&#8217;ve released a new version of my article,
<a href="http://www.dwheeler.com/essays/spam-email-password.html">
Countering Spam by Using Ham Passwords (Email Passwords)</a>.
In particular, I&#8217;ve christened the approach with a new name:
&#8220;ham passwords&#8221;.
I&#8217;ve found that
ham passwords are a simple and effective technique for countering spam;
<a href="http://www.dwheeler.com/contactme.html">I use it myself</a>.
A ham password is a special password you ask strangers, or senders in
general, to include in email they send to you, typically in the subject line.
If the sender wants the receiver to receive an email, then the sender
should send the ham password to prove that they are authorized to
send the email.
This technique is excellent in countering the major weakness of
spam filters: incorrectly labelling ham as spam.
This approach is inexpensive, requires no changes to any software code,
and is simple to understand.
It especially works well when combined with other techniques that
handle non-strangers.

<p><a name="firefox-coming"><font size="+2"><b>Firefox is coming November 9, 2004&#8230;</b></font></a></p><p></p>
The official release of the Firefox web browser is coming soon,
on November 9, 2004.
Of course, &#8220;new&#8221; is misleading; much of the infrastructure of Firefox
is based on Mozilla, which is based on Netscape Navigator&#8217;s original code.
But Mozilla underwent a major redesign in 1998 to make its infrastructure
design far better, and now the same is happening to the outer browser.
The result - a very nice browser.
It&#8217;s clean and simple, yet it&#8217;s easy to add extensions that do lots of
extremely useful things.
I really like it; if you haven&#8217;t checked it out, you need to.
<p>
Firefox has lots of useful capabilities.
I love tabbed browsing, which it supports;
I find it truly painful now to use a browser without
tabbed browsing (such as Internet Explorer (IE)).
Firefox&#8217;s built-in tabbed searching and finding is really nice.
There&#8217;s much to like from a security point of view:
it won&#8217;t load harmful ActiveX controls, it has a built-in pop-up blocker,
and frankly it&#8217;s got a better security history to recommend it.
Indeed, CERT&#8217;s taken the unusual step of suggesting that a good
solution to IE&#8217;s endless woes is to switch browsers;
<a href="http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,1759,1617931,00.asp">
eWEEK.com Senior Editor Steven J. Vaughan-Nichols recommends dumping
IE as too dangerous</a>.
<p>
But something very nice about Firefox - and not as clearly crowed by
its developers - is that Firefox is far more standards-compliant.
This isn&#8217;t just an idle claim;
<a href="http://www.quirksmode.org/css/contents.html">this detailed analysis
of CSS support</a> clearly shows how badly IE supports CSS, a key web standard.
No browser is perfect; Firefox is based on Mozilla, and you&#8217;ll notice
some weaknesses of Mozilla in that paper.
But you want a browser that&#8217;s
close and in the process of fixing any minor problems.
Even though many web application developers have complained mightily
to Microsoft for years for them to fix the many bugs and
incomplete capabilities of Internet Explorer,
<a href="http://news.com.com/2100-1032-5088642.html">
Internet Explorer has continued to poorly implement the web standards for
years, with little evidence they&#8217;ll be fixed soon.</a>
<p>
There are lots of nice extras you can get.
I like the &#8220;Google Cache&#8221; and &#8220;Internet Archive&#8221; extensions; they&#8217;re
very handy for research.
<p>
Firefox also runs on just about anything: Windows, Mac, Linux, Unix.
Notice that it runs on old versions of Windows (like Windows 98), too.
<p>
<a href="http://www.spreadfirefox.com/?q=affiliates&amp;id=31988&amp;t=60">If
you&#8217;re curious, download and try Firefox out - it&#8217;s free!</a>

<h1>Wed, 03 Nov 2004</h1>
<p><a name="oss-why-20041103"><font size="+2"><b>November 2004 release of &#8220;Why OSS/FS? Look at the Numbers!&#8221;</b></font></a></p><p></p>
I&#8217;ve made a somewhat major re-release of my paper
<a href="http://www.dwheeler.com/oss_fs_why.html">&#8220;Why Open Source Software /
Free Software (OSS/FS)? Look at the Numbers!&#8221;</a>
I made many changes, here are some of the highlights:
<ol>
<li>
I significantly rewrote the section on innovation.
In particular, I
added a number of references to OSS/FS innovation research at MIT
by von Hippel and others (such as Lakhani), including a reference to
<a href="http://www.cio.com/archive/101500/something.html">an interview</a>.
This research is very interesting.
von Hippel has studied innovation, and in particular
user influence on innovation, for decades; he brings an
incredibly interesting perspective to his study of OSS/FS.
I dropped the Sweetcode.org site reference;
it hasn&#8217;t been updated in a long time.

<li>
I created a
<a href="http://www.dwheeler.com/oss_fs_why.html#governments">new section
on governments</a>, and
completely reorganized the material.
It now has subsections for U.S., Europe, and other countries.
Hopefully it&#8217;ll be easier to follow now.
I added some material, such as the OMB policy for the U.S.

<li>
Noted that it&#8217;s sometimes illegal to independently
criticize proprietary products, due to
UCITA in some places, and legal ambiguity in many cases.
Included a few links to justify this, such as
<a href="http://www.infoworld.com/articles/op/xml/00/01/24/000124opfoster.html">
Ed Foster&#8217;s examples</a>,
<a href="http://weblog.infoworld.com/foster/2004/10/30.html">
Microsoft&#8217;s .NET clause</a>, and
<a href="http://www.ucita.com/">AFFECT</a>.

<li>
Modified the front of the paper so that it has
lots of links to subsections.
That will make it easier to jump to specific sections from the front.

<li>
I added interesting information from Linus Torvalds, who looked up
U.S. copyright law and found that the US Code specifically
notes exchange of copyrighted material as an <i>expected</i> potential
gain between parties.
So the basic idea of OSS/FS is specifically noted in the US Code itself.
This is in the section
<a href="http://www.dwheeler.com/oss_fs_why.html#ossfs-is-compatible-with-capitalism">is OSS/FS compatible with capitalism?</a>

<li>
Added more references to the vast amount of material available
from the Interchange of Data Between Administrations (IDA),
including news, case studies, etc.  This is especially of interest
to European readers, but I&#8217;m sure it&#8217;ll be interesting to others too.

<li>
Added more references to Firefox&#8217;s significantly growing
market share (and slightly shrinking IE market share).

<li>
Mentioned
<a href="http://www.dwheeler.com/oss_fs_why.html#mi2g">
mi2g&#8217;s November 2004 report</a>, and some of the issues about it, so
that people won&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve forgotten it.
I put it AFTER the main list of quantitative figures.
This report doesn&#8217;t take malware into account
in their main numbers - an absurdity.
They don&#8217;t take into account market share,
or whether or not a system is up-to-date on its patches, either.
What you REALLY want to know is the probability
that YOUR system will be broken into, given a particular OS,
and that info doesn&#8217;t seem to be available from them - at least not
from their public statements.
A lot of people have investigated mi2g and have many issues with it, too;
it seems only fair to mention all sides.

<li>
Added a reference to James Boyle&#8217;s
<a href="http://news.ft.com/cms/s/78d9812a-2386-11d9-aee5-00000e2511c8.html#U101244209021g4">
&#8220;Give me liberty and give me death?&#8221;</a>,
a response article that is better than the article it responds to
(my thanks to Groklaw, who pointed this article out on Nov 2, 2004).
This response article notes something rather extraordinary:
&#8220;IBM now earns more from what it calls &#8216;Linux-related revenues&#8217;
than it does from traditional patent licensing,
and IBM is the largest patent holder in the world.&#8221;
I added this to the section
<a href="http://www.dwheeler.com/oss_fs_why.html#ossfs-economically-viable">
Is OSS/FS economically viable?</a>

<li>
Added a reference to
<a href="http://opensource.mit.edu/">MIT&#8217;s website</a>, which has an impressive
collection of OSS/FS papers.

<li>
Added
<a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2004/10/22/security_report_windows_vs_linux.pdf">Nicholas Petreley&#8217;s security analysis</a>.

<li>
Added reference to
<a href="http://www.researchandmarkets.com/info/about.asp">
Research and Market&#8217;s TCO study</a>.

<li>
Added references to
<a href="http://www.ogc.gov.uk/index.asp?docid=2190">
UK policy and report</a>

<li>
Added reference to Communications of the ACM, October 2004.
