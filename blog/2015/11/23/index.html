<p>
<a href="http://motherboard.vice.com/read/ransomware-is-coming-to-medical-devices">Forrester Research has an interesting
cybersecurity prediction for 2016: We’ll see ransomware for a medical device or wearable</a>.
</p>

<p>
This is, unfortunately, plausible.
I don&#8217;t know if it will happen in 2016, but it&#8217;s pretty reasonable.
Indeed, I can see threats.. even if we can&#8217;t be sure that
the ransomware is even installed.
</p>

<p>
After all,
<a href="http://www.popsci.com/article/gadgets/how-dick-cheney-took-his-heart-offline-thwart-hackers">Dick Cheney had his pacemaker’s Wifi disabled because of this concern</a>
(see also
<a href="http://www.ibtimes.com/dick-cheney-deactivates-pacemaker-wi-fi-former-vp-felt-threatened-hackers-wanted-avoid-homeland">here</a>).
<a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/science/science-news/11212777/Terrorists-could-hack-pacemakers-like-in-Homeland-say-security-experts.html">People have already noted that terrorists might use this, since medical devices are often poorly secured</a>.
The additional observation is that may be a better way to (criminally)
make money.  We already have ransomware, including organizations who are
getting better at extorting with it. Traditional ransomware is foiled
by good backups; in this case backups won’t help, and victims will
(understandably) be willing to pay much, much more.  And I think that
medical devices are actually a softer target.
</p>

<p>
With luck, this won&#8217;t come true in 2016.
The question is, is that because it doesn&#8217;t show up until 2017 or 2018&#8230;
or because the first ones were in 2015?
<a href="https://gcn.com/articles/2015/11/18/medical-device-cybersecurity.aspx">DHS is funding work in this area</a>, and that&#8217;s good&#8230;
but while research can help, the real problem is that we have
too many software developers who do not have a clue how to develop
secure software&#8230; and too many people (software developers or not)
who think that&#8217;s acceptable.
</p>

<p>
In short,
we still have way too many people building safety-critical devices who
don&#8217;t understand that security is necessary for safety.
I hope that this changes - and quickly.
