&lt;a href=&quot;http://motherboard.vice.com/read/ransomware-is-coming-to-medical-devices&quot;&gt;Forrester Research has an interesting
cybersecurity prediction for 2016: We’ll see ransomware for a medical device or wearable&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
This is, unfortunately, plausible.
I don&amp;#8217;t know if it will happen in 2016, but it&amp;#8217;s pretty reasonable.
Indeed, I can see threats.. even if we can&amp;#8217;t be sure that
the ransomware is even installed.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
After all,
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.popsci.com/article/gadgets/how-dick-cheney-took-his-heart-offline-thwart-hackers&quot;&gt;Dick Cheney had his pacemaker’s Wifi disabled because of this concern&lt;/a&gt;
(see also
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ibtimes.com/dick-cheney-deactivates-pacemaker-wi-fi-former-vp-felt-threatened-hackers-wanted-avoid-homeland&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;).
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/science/science-news/11212777/Terrorists-could-hack-pacemakers-like-in-Homeland-say-security-experts.html&quot;&gt;People have already noted that terrorists might use this, since medical devices are often poorly secured&lt;/a&gt;.
The additional observation is that may be a better way to (criminally)
make money.  We already have ransomware, including organizations who are
getting better at extorting with it. Traditional ransomware is foiled
by good backups; in this case backups won’t help, and victims will
(understandably) be willing to pay much, much more.  And I think that
medical devices are actually a softer target.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
With luck, this won&amp;#8217;t come true in 2016.
The question is, is that because it doesn&amp;#8217;t show up until 2017 or 2018&amp;#8230;
or because the first ones were in 2015?
&lt;a href=&quot;https://gcn.com/articles/2015/11/18/medical-device-cybersecurity.aspx&quot;&gt;DHS is funding work in this area&lt;/a&gt;, and that&amp;#8217;s good&amp;#8230;
but while research can help, the real problem is that we have
too many software developers who do not have a clue how to develop
secure software&amp;#8230; and too many people (software developers or not)
who think that&amp;#8217;s acceptable.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
In short,
we still have way too many people building safety-critical devices who
don&amp;#8217;t understand that security is necessary for safety.
I hope that this changes - and quickly.
&lt;/p&gt;
