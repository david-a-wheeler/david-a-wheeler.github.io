&lt;p&gt;
The Chrome web browser is starting to lie to users about the URL you
are viewing, for example, by removing &amp;#8220;www.&amp;#8221; if it is a prefix.
I do not like this, because I think it is dangerous to tell people
incorrect information.
I&amp;#8217;ve had a website for a very long time, and when I started it,
the recommended practice was to use &amp;#8220;www.&amp;#8221; prefixes for websites&amp;#8230;
so that is what I have been doing.
Since I cannot prevent Chrome from lying, and I want people to accurately see
name of the website they are looking at, I&amp;#8217;m going to switch this
site&amp;#8217;s standard name to be &amp;#8220;dwheeler.com&amp;#8221;
instead of &amp;#8220;www.dwheeler.com&amp;#8221;.
That will not fix the problem for other sites, but it will fix it for this one.
I will set up a redirection and slowly switch some links to the new name.
&lt;/p&gt;
