<p>
The Chrome web browser is starting to lie to users about the URL you
are viewing, for example, by removing &#8220;www.&#8221; if it is a prefix.
I do not like this, because I think it is dangerous to tell people
incorrect information.
I&#8217;ve had a website for a very long time, and when I started it,
the recommended practice was to use &#8220;www.&#8221; prefixes for websites&#8230;
so that is what I have been doing.
Since I cannot prevent Chrome from lying, and I want people to accurately see
name of the website they are looking at, I&#8217;m going to switch this
site&#8217;s standard name to be &#8220;dwheeler.com&#8221;
instead of &#8220;www.dwheeler.com&#8221;.
That will not fix the problem for other sites, but it will fix it for this one.
I will set up a redirection and slowly switch some links to the new name.
