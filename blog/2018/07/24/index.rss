&lt;p&gt;
Historically most email has been unencrypted, and that has a serious flaw:
unencrypted email can be read and modified by anyone between
the sender and final receiver.
Tools to do &amp;#8220;end-to-end&amp;#8221; encryption of email
(to prevent reading and/or modifying it)
have been available for decades,
but they are often hard to use by &amp;#8220;normal&amp;#8221; users.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Thankfully, there&amp;#8217;s been work to significantly improve email security.
In particular, STARTTLS email encryption is now widely supported, and
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.starttls-everywhere.org/&quot;&gt;the
Electronic Frontier Foundation &amp;#8220;STARTTLS Everywhere&amp;#8221; initiative&lt;/a&gt;
is working to get &lt;i&gt;everyone&lt;/i&gt; to support STARTTLS in their
email systems. Therefore:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Organizations: support STARTTLS if you don&amp;#8217;t already!&lt;/b&gt;
If you support STARTTLS, then
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.starttls-everywhere.org&quot;&gt;check your STARTTLS configuration,
join the &amp;#8220;STARTTLS Policy List&amp;#8221;, and check that policy list before
sending an email&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Individuals:
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.starttls-everywhere.org&quot;&gt;see if your organization
properly supports STARTTLS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;. If they do not,
bug your organization to get that fixed.
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
STARTTLS is not perfect, as I&amp;#8217;ll discuss below.
My point is that it&amp;#8217;s &lt;i&gt;way&lt;/i&gt; more secure
than most email without it, because it improves security without
requiring end-users to do anything.
Below is additional information that I think you&amp;#8217;ll find interesting.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
First, here&amp;#8217;s how STARTTLS works.
Email is transmitted by a series of &amp;#8220;hops&amp;#8221;;
if the hop recipient supports STARTTLS, email is
&lt;i&gt;automatically&lt;/i&gt; encrypted on that hop as it
goes through the infrastructure, &lt;i&gt;without&lt;/i&gt; requiring
email users to do anything special.
That ease-of-use is a &lt;i&gt;big deal&lt;/i&gt; - users normally do whatever is the
default, so if the default is secure, then users will normally do
the secure thing.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Lots&lt;/i&gt; of organizations now support STARTTLS.
Google reports that by 2018-07-24
90% of its incoming email, and 90% of outgoing email, was
encrypted using STARTTLS
(&amp;#8220;&lt;a href=&quot;https://transparencyreport.google.com/safer-email/overview&quot;&gt;Email encryption in transit&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#8221;).
Many email services support STARTTLS, including
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.starttls-everywhere.org/results/?gmail.com&quot;&gt;Gmail&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.starttls-everywhere.org/results/?yahoo.com&quot;&gt;Yahoo.com&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.starttls-everywhere.org/results/?outlook.com&quot;&gt;Outlook.com&lt;/a&gt;,
and
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.starttls-everywhere.org/results/?runbox.com&quot;&gt;runbox.com&lt;/a&gt;.
(This includes the
&lt;a href=&quot;https://morningconsult.com/2017/06/21/poll-gmail-dominates-email-use/&quot;&gt;top email services&lt;/a&gt;.)
Many other organizations support STARTTLS, including
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.starttls-everywhere.org/results/?google.com&quot;&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.starttls-everywhere.org/results/?microsoft.com&quot;&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.starttls-everywhere.org/results/?bankofamerica.com&quot;&gt;Bank of America&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.starttls-everywhere.org/results/?redcross.org&quot;&gt;The American Red Cross&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.starttls-everywhere.org/results/?salvationarmy.org&quot;&gt;The Salvation Army&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.starttls-everywhere.org/results/?sei.cmu.edu&quot;&gt;The Software Engineering Institute (SEI)&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.starttls-everywhere.org/results/?cmu.edu&quot;&gt;Carnegie Mellon University (CMU)&lt;/a&gt;,
and
&lt;a href=&quot;https://starttls-everywhere.org/results/?berkeley.edu&quot;&gt;University of California, Berkeley&lt;/a&gt;.
I give this list to show that there are many different kinds of organizations
that support STARTTLS.
The &lt;a href=&quot;https://starttls-everywhere.org/policy-list/&quot;&gt;STARTTLS
Policy List&lt;/a&gt; has an incomplete list of organizations
known to be supporting STARTTLS.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.starttls-everywhere.org/&quot;&gt;The
Electronic Frontier Foundation &amp;#8220;STARTTLS Everywhere&amp;#8221; initiative&lt;/a&gt;
is an effort to get lagging organizations to support STARTTLS.
As I noted earlier,
you should use their tools to see if your organization properly supports
STARTTLS on its incoming emails, and if not, complain to get that fixed.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
There are some historical problems that
the STARTTLS Everywhere project is working to fix:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some people allow the absurdly old vulnerable protocols SSLv2 and SSLv3
when using STARTTLS, instead of using the newer TLS protocols.
TLS version 1.0 came out in January 1999, so there&amp;#8217;s been plenty of
time to transition away from SSLv2 and SSLv3.
The STARTTLS Everywhere project expressly warns about that, and
won&amp;#8217;t give credit unless you&amp;#8217;re using TLS.
&lt;li&gt;Some sites with STARTTLS use invalid certificates.
STARTTLS Everywhere tells you about that, and also explains some solutions
so you can use valid certificates instead.
&lt;li&gt;Historically active attackers can downgrade email encryption by
stripping away the STARTTLS request, or can interpose nonsense certificates
so that they receive the encrypted email instead.
The STARTTLS Everywhere project
has created a &amp;#8220;STARTTLS Policy List&amp;#8221; where supporting organizations
can assert that they always use STARTTLS using a valid certificate.
Organizations should join that list and check that list before they send email.
Once they do, email transmissions cannot be downgraded and certificates
cannot replaced, because senders will know to only use STARTTLS with valid
certificates for those organizations.
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
STARTTLS is &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; an end-to-end encryption system.
STARTTLS only encrypts while the email is being sent between systems (&amp;#8220;hops&amp;#8221;).
That&amp;#8217;s not all bad.
For example, it means that receiving organizations can continue to
examine the emails to check for viruses/malware, counter spam, and so on.
But of course, there are downsides.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
STARTTLS is, in general, &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; as strong as an end-to-end
encryption system (from the point-of-view of providing confidentiality
and integrity).
For example, receiving organizations (and anyone who subverts their
email system) can see and modify the email.
Users who do not trust their email service providers should &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt;
depend on STARTTLS; they &lt;i&gt;must&lt;/i&gt; use end-to-end encryption.
In general, end-to-end encryption is stronger,
so we should still work to make end-to-end email encryption easier
to use and deploy.
But for various reasons it&amp;#8217;s hard to deploy end-to-end email encryption,
and we&amp;#8217;ve spent decades trying.
Also, STARTTLS works just fine &lt;i&gt;with&lt;/i&gt; end-to-end encryption.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Please indulge me: I think a small rant is appropriate here.
There are some security specialists who think that only the perfect is
acceptable.
Nonsense! Requiring perfection is crazy.
I think it is important, when creating and maintaining systems, to have
an &lt;i&gt;engineering&lt;/i&gt; mindset.
In particular, you must always remember that
that choices have trade-offs.
It is not possible to have no risk; an asteroid might land
on your head tomorrow.
It is not reasonable to demand that systems be used regardless of their
difficulty or expense; we all have limited time and money.
Security issues are real, and we &lt;i&gt;do&lt;/i&gt; need to address them,
but time, money, and ease-of-use also matter greatly.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Unlike most other systems,
STARTTLS is completely automatic (end-users don&amp;#8217;t have to do anything)
once it is set up, it is not hard to set up,
and it counters a large class of attacks.
For almost all users, email encryption with STARTTLS
is a major improvement over what they had before.
Let&amp;#8217;s keep working to deploy even better systems,
but let&amp;#8217;s take partial victories where we can get them.
&lt;/p&gt;
