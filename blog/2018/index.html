Are you developing open source software (OSS)? Selecting some?
If you&#8217;re developing OSS, earn a best practices badge from
the Linux Foundation Core Infrastructure Initiative (CII).
If you&#8217;re selecting OSS, prefer OSS that has earned a badge.
The badge shows that the project is applying
the best practices for today&#8217;s projects.

<p><a name="allsome"><font size="+2"><b>The allsome quantifier</b></font></a></p><p></p>
<p>
For over 100 years formal logic has routinely represented
ideas like &#8220;all Xs are Ys&#8221; using something called the
&#8220;for all quantifier&#8221;, abbreviated as &forall;.
This lets people mathematically represent statements like
&#8220;All Martians are green&#8221;.
This is <i>really</i> important today, because these mathematical
statements can be used to determine if systems work correctly;
in some cases this can be used to save lives.
</p>

<p>
However, there is a problem.
It is easy to mistranslate informal statements into formal logic,
and these errors can cause serious problems.
For example, in formal logic,
the normal way to represent the statements
&#8220;All Martians are green&#8221;
and
&#8220;All Martians are not green&#8221;
can be <i>simultaneously</i> true (namely, when there are no Martians).
</p>

<p>
Informal statements with this format often embed the assumption
that the situation occurs
(that is, that there is at least one Martian).
This mismatch between formal logic and informal statements could lead
to problems, and conceivably to deaths.
</p>

<p>
I propose a small solution -
a new formal logic quantifier called
&#8220;allsome&#8221; (aka &#8220;all some&#8221;) that is designed
to make some of these mistranslations less likely.
The allsome quantifier, abbreviated &forall;!,
simultaneously expresses for all (&forall;)
and there exists (&exist;) in a way that models many informal
statements.
I hope that this new quantifier will
reduce the risk of mistranslations of informal statements into
formal expressions, and that
others will eventually agree that allsome is awesome.

<p><a name="no-mobile-apps"><font size="+2"><b>Do not install or develop mobile apps unless you have to</b></font></a></p><p></p>
<p>
If you are thinking about installing another mobile app on your smartphone,
or thinking about developing a mobile app, I have a simple recommendation:
<i>Don&#8217;t do it</i> unless you must do it to get the
capability you want.
In many cases, using or developing just a web application is the better choice.
</p>

<p>
First, if you install a mobile application, that mobile
application often has a lot of access to information that you
probably don&#8217;t want it to have.
What&#8217;s more, many of the organizations developing mobile apps
have a business model that involves subtly getting as much personal data
about you as possible, and selling that to others.
Smartphone operating systems have security mechanisms that try to reduce
the impact of these problems, by providing some control over what the
application can access, and that&#8217;s a good thing.
However,
it&#8217;s hard to stem the tide because smartphone operating systems <i>do</i>
have direct access to a lot of data about you.
Smartphone operating systems have direct access to your location,
fixed personal identifiers like your cell phone number,
and often have direct access to information such as your list of contacts.
There <i>are</i> cases
where it needs to be shared, so in the name of &#8220;making things easy&#8221;
these mobile applications often end up with far more privileges
than they should have.

<p>
In contrast, web browsers have long had to counter web applications that
try to extract data from you.
They certainly do not prevent all problems, but they are designed so that
they do <i>not</i> give away location, cell phone numbers, or your contact
list so easily.
Many services are perfectly workable through web browsers instead of
web applications, at least for typical uses.
This includes
sites such as <a href="https://youtube.com">Youtube</a>,
<a href="https://facebook.com">Facebook</a>, and
<a href="https://twitter.com">Twitter</a>.
In addition, once you do <i>not</i> install those apps, you will have room
for applications that really <i>do</i> need to be a mobile app&#8230;
and thus will not need to upgrade your smartphone as often.
</p>

<p>
And if you&#8217;re thinking about developing a mobile app: Don&#8217;t do it,
at least without seeing if there&#8217;s a viable alternative.
For many situations, creating mobile applications is a huge waste of money.
The
<a href="https://govinsider.asia/smart-gov/why-britain-banned-mobile-apps/">United Kingdom essentially banned the development of mobile applications</a>,
noting that mobile applications are “very expensive to produce,
and they’re very very expensive to maintain
because you have to keep updating them when
there are software changes.”
A related problem is that if you develop mobile apps
you typically have to write at least three versions of the software:
an iOS mobile app, an Android mobile app,
and a web application so people can use large screens.
If you&#8217;re a commercial organization, a mobile application can not only
be costly to develop (in part because you will have to develop the application
multiple times), but in practice
you&#8217;ll have to pay a large cut of your revenue to Google and Apple
(<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/19/16502152/google-play-store-android-apple-app-store-subscription-revenue-cut">typically 15% of your revenue</a>).
Are you really sure you want to spend or lose that much money?
</p>

<p>
What&#8217;s more, web applications can increasingly be used
<i>instead</i> of mobile/native applications, even in cases where it was
impossible at one time.
I should first note that I&#8217;m using an expansive definition of
&#8220;web application&#8221; here - I just mean anything you can access
using a web browser.
Historically, the main reason you needed to create
a mobile or native application was because you
needed the application to work offline.
However,
<a href="https://caniuse.com/#feat=serviceworkers">service workers
now make it practical to create many offline applications and
are widely available</a>.
Internet Explorer (IE) is the only major browser that does not support
service workers, but people who have IE can easily use or install a modern
web browser instead (such as Firefox, Chrome, or Edge).
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Apps/Fundamentals/Offline">There are other ways to develop offline web applications too</a>.
Another reason to create mobile or native applications was speed,
but recent JavaScript optimization work has made web applications much faster.
In addition, <a href="https://webassembly.org/">WebAssembly</a> makes it
possible to create some applications that run <i>far</i> faster and is
supported by Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge.
When developing web applications to handle all devices you need to use
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsive_web_design">responsive
web design</a>, but that is already good practice and widely supported.
Since April 2015 Google&#8217;s search engine has
penalized web sites that are not mobile-friendly; this really is not
anything new.
Users can easily bookmark your web application to get there later, too.
</p>

<p>
There are many advantages of just developing a web application.
There are a huge number of tools already developed to help you develop
web applications, for one thing.
Many of those tools are open source software and no-cost.
A large number of people already know how to develop web applications, too.
Perhaps most importantly, web applications are standards-based;
you are not locked into any one organization&#8217;s ecosystem.
</p>

<p>
Most obviously: If you are already going to develop a web application,
maybe you don&#8217;t need to write two more versions of the same software
and try to maintain them too.
There are tools that let you try to write software that ports between
iOS and Android, but software you do not need to write at all is
the easiest to maintain.
</p>

<p>
Do you need to create a vanity mobile app for your conference so
that attendees can see what talks are where?  Often the answer is no.
Do you need a mobile app so that people can fill in a simple
form (such as for government services)?
Again, the answer is often no.
</p>

<p>
Of course, there are perfectly valid reasons to create a mobile application
(or other kind of native application)
for end-users, and that means there are good
reasons to install a mobile app.
Some applications require access to specialized device services that are not
accessible from a web browser, or have speed requirements beyond
what a web browser can currently provide.
In addition, some apps are older and are not likely to be rewritten.
But today I find that many people are not thinking about the alternatives,
and ignoring alternatives is a mistake.
Before installing or creating (multiple) mobile applications, ask yourself,
<i>do I need to?</i>.
If you don&#8217;t need to do that, and can use or create a web application
instead, you might be able to save yourself a lot of trouble.

<p><a name="removing-www"><font size="+2"><b>Removing www prefix on this website due to Chrome nonsense</b></font></a></p><p></p>
<p>
The Chrome web browser is starting to lie to users about the URL you
are viewing, for example, by removing &#8220;www.&#8221; if it is a prefix.
I do not like this, because I think it is dangerous to tell people
incorrect information.
I&#8217;ve had a website for a very long time, and when I started it,
the recommended practice was to use &#8220;www.&#8221; prefixes for websites&#8230;
so that is what I have been doing.
Since I cannot prevent Chrome from lying, and I want people to accurately see
name of the website they are looking at, I&#8217;m going to switch this
site&#8217;s standard name to be &#8220;dwheeler.com&#8221;
instead of &#8220;www.dwheeler.com&#8221;.
That will not fix the problem for other sites, but it will fix it for this one.
I will set up a redirection and slowly switch some links to the new name.

<p><a name="verified-voting"><font size="+2"><b>Verified voting still necessary, paperless voting still untrustworthy</b></font></a></p><p></p>
<p>
In
<a href="https://www.dwheeler.com/blog/2006/10/14/">2006 I wrote
&#8220;Direct Recording Electronic (DRE) Voting: Why Your Vote Doesn&#8217;t Matter&#8221;</a>.
Over a decade later, voting systems are <i>still</i> being used that
are fundamentally insecure - though things are <i>better</i> in some places.
</p>

<p>
First, the basics.
If a voting system uses anything other than voter-verified paper
to vote, then that voting system is
<b>not secure</b>.  Paper does not automatically make a voting system secure,
but a system that does not use voter-verified paper <i>cannot</i> be secure.
Verified voting using paper ballots is a <i>minimum</i>
requirement for a trustworthy voting system.
Direct recording equipment (DRE) and mobile phone voting systems
<i>cannot</i> be adequately secure for elections of government positions.
These insecure systems are simply invitations for vote tampering.
</p>

<p>
The article <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/aug/13/us-election-cybersecurity-hacking-voting">&#8220;Why US elections remain &#8216;dangerously vulnerable&#8217; to cyber-attacks&#8221;</a>
discusses some of the reasons why many of the US voting systems are
fundamentally untrustworthy.
One quote:
&#8220;Georgia&#8217;s election officials continue to defend the state&#8217;s
electronic voting system that is demonstrably unreliable and insecure,
and have repeatedly refused to take administrative, regulatory or
legislative action to address the election security failures.&#8221;
Another quote:
&#8220;there is little mystery about the safest available voting technology -
optically scanned paper ballots, now used by about 80% of US voters.
Some of the states that don&#8217;t have this technology, like Louisiana,
would like it but don&#8217;t have the funds to switch. Others, like
Georgia and South Carolina, simply aren&#8217;t interested in ditching their
all-electronic systems despite the compelling reasons to do so.&#8221;
</p>

<p>
<a href="https://money.cnn.com/2018/08/06/technology/mobile-voting-west-virginia-voatz/index.html">&#8220;West Virginia to introduce mobile phone voting for midterm elections&#8221; by Donie O&#8217;Sullivan</a>
discusses West Virginia&#8217;s introduction of mobile phone voting.
Does this require a paper ballot?
No.
Therefore, West Virginia&#8217;s proposed
voting system is horrifically insecure,
and its results will be completely untrustworthy if implemented.
</p>

<p>
<a href="https://xkcd.com/2030/">XKCD&#8217;s &#8220;Voting Software&#8221;</a>
is a funny summary.
In short: experts on computer security agree that computers must not
be directly used for voting when there are important stakes
(such as a vote for a political office).
When experts say &#8220;you cannot adequately trust the systems we build&#8221;
you should believe the experts.
</p>

<p>
<a href="https://www.dwheeler.com/blog/2006/10/14/">As I noted earlier</a>,
&#8220;I used to do magic tricks, and all magic tricks work the same way -
misdirect the viewer, so that what they think they see is not the same
as reality. Many magic tricks depend on rigged props, where what you
see is NOT the whole story. DREs are the ultimate illusion - the naive
think they know what&#8217;s happening, but in fact they have no way to know
what&#8217;s really going on.&#8221;
</p>

<p>
I am sure that some election officials will bristle when told that
we cannot trust the legitimacy of their results.
Too bad.
If your election system uses
technology that is widely known to be easily subverted,
such as voting machines that do not use voter-verified paper ballots,
then your results <i>should</i> be viewed with deep suspicion.
Without voter-verified paper ballots
there is no way to independently verify vote counts, so there
is no <i>reason</i> to trust the results.
This is old information; those who have not replaced insecure systems
are those who have failed to act.
Some states certify or approve the use of voting machines without
voter-verified paper ballots, but that just shows that their certification
or approval processes fail to provide even a minimum level of security.
</p>

<p>
There is more to protecting the legitimacy of votes, of course.
For example, it is critical to ensure
that only eligible voters can vote, that voters can vote at most once,
and that paper votes cannot be added or removed.
But currently many districts are not doing the minimum necessary to have
trustworthy election results, and we need to get systems up to
minimal standards.
</p>

<p>
There is an old phrase:
“It’s not the people who vote that count.
It’s the people who count the votes.”
<a href="https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/stalin-vote-count-quote/">Stalin
did not say that exactly, but he did say something like it</a>.
The point is that if we do not adequately protect the
process of counting votes,
then the vote counts are vulnerable to manipulation.
</p>

<p>
The
<a href="https://www.verifiedvoting.org/voting-system-principles/">Voting
system principles from Verified Voting</a> provides a useful
starting list of requirements; there are other guides too.
Voting systems that fail to meet those principles are untrustworthy toys
that should not be used for real elections.
It is fine to use direct recording equipment, mobile phone voting,
or other insecure systems when you are voting for homecoming queen
or deciding where to go to lunch.
But it is time to stop using fundamentally flawed voting systems like these
for elections that matter.

<p><a name="email-encryption"><font size="+2"><b>Email encryption is here! Use STARTTLS everywhere!</b></font></a></p><p></p>
<p>
Historically most email has been unencrypted, and that has a serious flaw:
unencrypted email can be read and modified by anyone between
the sender and final receiver.
Tools to do &#8220;end-to-end&#8221; encryption of email
(to prevent reading and/or modifying it)
have been available for decades,
but they are often hard to use by &#8220;normal&#8221; users.
</p>

<p>
Thankfully, there&#8217;s been work to significantly improve email security.
In particular, STARTTLS email encryption is now widely supported, and
<a href="https://www.starttls-everywhere.org/">the
Electronic Frontier Foundation &#8220;STARTTLS Everywhere&#8221; initiative</a>
is working to get <i>everyone</i> to support STARTTLS in their
email systems. Therefore:
</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Organizations: support STARTTLS if you don&#8217;t already!</b>
If you support STARTTLS, then
<a href="https://www.starttls-everywhere.org">check your STARTTLS configuration,
join the &#8220;STARTTLS Policy List&#8221;, and check that policy list before
sending an email</a>.
<li><b>Individuals:
<a href="https://www.starttls-everywhere.org">see if your organization
properly supports STARTTLS</a></b>. If they do not,
bug your organization to get that fixed.
</ul>

<p>
STARTTLS is not perfect, as I&#8217;ll discuss below.
My point is that it&#8217;s <i>way</i> more secure
than most email without it, because it improves security without
requiring end-users to do anything.
Below is additional information that I think you&#8217;ll find interesting.
</p>

<p>
First, here&#8217;s how STARTTLS works.
Email is transmitted by a series of &#8220;hops&#8221;;
if the hop recipient supports STARTTLS, email is
<i>automatically</i> encrypted on that hop as it
goes through the infrastructure, <i>without</i> requiring
email users to do anything special.
That ease-of-use is a <i>big deal</i> - users normally do whatever is the
default, so if the default is secure, then users will normally do
the secure thing.
</p>

<p>
<i>Lots</i> of organizations now support STARTTLS.
Google reports that by 2018-07-24
90% of its incoming email, and 90% of outgoing email, was
encrypted using STARTTLS
(&#8220;<a href="https://transparencyreport.google.com/safer-email/overview">Email encryption in transit</a>&#8221;).
Many email services support STARTTLS, including
<a href="https://www.starttls-everywhere.org/results/?gmail.com">Gmail</a>,
<a href="https://www.starttls-everywhere.org/results/?yahoo.com">Yahoo.com</a>,
<a href="https://www.starttls-everywhere.org/results/?outlook.com">Outlook.com</a>,
and
<a href="https://www.starttls-everywhere.org/results/?runbox.com">runbox.com</a>.
(This includes the
<a href="https://morningconsult.com/2017/06/21/poll-gmail-dominates-email-use/">top email services</a>.)
Many other organizations support STARTTLS, including
<a href="https://www.starttls-everywhere.org/results/?google.com">Google</a>,
<a href="https://www.starttls-everywhere.org/results/?microsoft.com">Microsoft</a>,
<a href="https://www.starttls-everywhere.org/results/?bankofamerica.com">Bank of America</a>,
<a href="https://www.starttls-everywhere.org/results/?redcross.org">The American Red Cross</a>,
<a href="https://www.starttls-everywhere.org/results/?salvationarmy.org">The Salvation Army</a>,
<a href="https://www.starttls-everywhere.org/results/?sei.cmu.edu">The Software Engineering Institute (SEI)</a>,
<a href="https://www.starttls-everywhere.org/results/?cmu.edu">Carnegie Mellon University (CMU)</a>,
and
<a href="https://starttls-everywhere.org/results/?berkeley.edu">University of California, Berkeley</a>.
I give this list to show that there are many different kinds of organizations
that support STARTTLS.
The <a href="https://starttls-everywhere.org/policy-list/">STARTTLS
Policy List</a> has an incomplete list of organizations
known to be supporting STARTTLS.
</p>

<p>
<a href="https://www.starttls-everywhere.org/">The
Electronic Frontier Foundation &#8220;STARTTLS Everywhere&#8221; initiative</a>
is an effort to get lagging organizations to support STARTTLS.
As I noted earlier,
you should use their tools to see if your organization properly supports
STARTTLS on its incoming emails, and if not, complain to get that fixed.
</p>

<p>
There are some historical problems that
the STARTTLS Everywhere project is working to fix:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Some people allow the absurdly old vulnerable protocols SSLv2 and SSLv3
when using STARTTLS, instead of using the newer TLS protocols.
TLS version 1.0 came out in January 1999, so there&#8217;s been plenty of
time to transition away from SSLv2 and SSLv3.
The STARTTLS Everywhere project expressly warns about that, and
won&#8217;t give credit unless you&#8217;re using TLS.
<li>Some sites with STARTTLS use invalid certificates.
STARTTLS Everywhere tells you about that, and also explains some solutions
so you can use valid certificates instead.
<li>Historically active attackers can downgrade email encryption by
stripping away the STARTTLS request, or can interpose nonsense certificates
so that they receive the encrypted email instead.
The STARTTLS Everywhere project
has created a &#8220;STARTTLS Policy List&#8221; where supporting organizations
can assert that they always use STARTTLS using a valid certificate.
Organizations should join that list and check that list before they send email.
Once they do, email transmissions cannot be downgraded and certificates
cannot replaced, because senders will know to only use STARTTLS with valid
certificates for those organizations.
</ul>

<p>
STARTTLS is <i>not</i> an end-to-end encryption system.
STARTTLS only encrypts while the email is being sent between systems (&#8220;hops&#8221;).
That&#8217;s not all bad.
For example, it means that receiving organizations can continue to
examine the emails to check for viruses/malware, counter spam, and so on.
But of course, there are downsides.
</p>

<p>
STARTTLS is, in general, <i>not</i> as strong as an end-to-end
encryption system (from the point-of-view of providing confidentiality
and integrity).
For example, receiving organizations (and anyone who subverts their
email system) can see and modify the email.
Users who do not trust their email service providers should <i>not</i>
depend on STARTTLS; they <i>must</i> use end-to-end encryption.
In general, end-to-end encryption is stronger,
so we should still work to make end-to-end email encryption easier
to use and deploy.
But for various reasons it&#8217;s hard to deploy end-to-end email encryption,
and we&#8217;ve spent decades trying.
Also, STARTTLS works just fine <i>with</i> end-to-end encryption.
</p>

<p>
Please indulge me: I think a small rant is appropriate here.
There are some security specialists who think that only the perfect is
acceptable.
Nonsense! Requiring perfection is crazy.
I think it is important, when creating and maintaining systems, to have
an <i>engineering</i> mindset.
In particular, you must always remember that
that choices have trade-offs.
It is not possible to have no risk; an asteroid might land
on your head tomorrow.
It is not reasonable to demand that systems be used regardless of their
difficulty or expense; we all have limited time and money.
Security issues are real, and we <i>do</i> need to address them,
but time, money, and ease-of-use also matter greatly.
</p>

<p>
Unlike most other systems,
STARTTLS is completely automatic (end-users don&#8217;t have to do anything)
once it is set up, it is not hard to set up,
and it counters a large class of attacks.
For almost all users, email encryption with STARTTLS
is a major improvement over what they had before.
Let&#8217;s keep working to deploy even better systems,
but let&#8217;s take partial victories where we can get them.
