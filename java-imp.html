<center><b><font size=+3>Java Implementations</font></b>
<br><b>by David K. Friedman and David A. Wheeler</b>
<br><b>August 5, 2002</b></center>
<b><font size=+3>Abstract</font></b>
<p><i>This article briefly introduces Java, provides a bit of Java history,
and describes various Java implementations.</i>

<p>
As of March 2005, many developers avoid using Java because it has
had inadequate open source software / Free Software (OSS/FS) implementations,
so using Java has meant falling into
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/java-trap.html">the Java trap.</a>
For many users, this makes using Java programs incredibly inconvenient;
few operating system vendors (other than Sun) can or will distribute Sun's
Java implementation, so installing a Java program is currently a big hassle.
That's a death blow for a development tool -- it's
unwise to make products that create extra hassles for customers!
Sun has placed many roadblocks interfering with OSS/FS implementations,
even though many believe this strategy has been very unwise; see
<a href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/let-java-go.html">Eric S. Raymond's
"Let Java Go"</a> and
<a href="http://sys-con.com/story/print.cfm?storyid=43969">comments
by IBM's Bob Sutor</a>.
Many problems arise from the so-called Java "community" process (JCP);
those issues are discussed by
<a href="http://news.com.com/Whats+wrong+with+the+Java+community+process/2008-1082_3-5607094.html">IBM's software chief, senior vice president and group executive Steve Mills</a> and in
<a href="http://linuxintegrators.com/blog/acoliver/news/?permalink=0124.html">
Andrew C. Oliver's comments on the JCP</a>.
Sun's March 2005 efforts to "simplify" their licenses, without actually
meeting the demands of many customers,
<a href="http://www.advogato.org/person/robilad/diary.html?start=65">
have met with widescale derision.</a>

<p>
Thankfully, OSS/FS Java implementations are starting to mature.
The primary problem has been
<a href="http://www.fosdem.org/2005/index/dev_room_classpath/schedule#dev_room_classpath_dev_room_track_002">
inadequate library support for GUIs</a>, but
this appears to be changing, finally.

Eclipse now runs without Sun's JDK</a>.
<a href="http://software.newsforge.com/software/05/02/25/209222.shtml">
OpenOffice.org version 2.0 has been criticized for its Java dependencies</a>
(<a href="http://software.newsforge.com/article.pl?sid=05/03/22/204244&from=rss">multiple times</a>),
but there's ongoing work to
<a href="http://tools.openoffice.org/">make Openoffice.org run
on OSS/FS Java implementations</a> (mainly gcj plus Classpath);
<a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/ml/java/2005-01/msg00023.html">
success for the critical portions was reported in January 2005</a>, and
<a href="http://blogs.linux.ie/caolan/2005/03/10/latest-gcj-and-ooo2-update/">
by March 2005 even more success was reported</a>.
See
<a href="http://www.openoffice.org/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=46241">
OpenOffice.org issue #46241, which asks to have OpenOffice.org run on an
OSS/FS Java Virtual Machine</a>, and
<a href="http://tools.openoffice.org/servlets/BrowseList?list=jdk&by=thread&from=351761">the OpenOffice.org Java policy to encourage portability across
different Java implementations</a>.
<p>
The
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/classpath/classpath.html">
GNU Classpath library project</a> is an important project to create
an OSS/FS Java library.
There many Java implementations, many of which use the GNU Classpath
library.
These implementations include
GNU's <a href="http://sourceware.cygnus.com/java/">gcj</a> Java compiler
(part of the gcc toolsuite),
<a href="http://www.kaffe.org/">Kaffe</a>,
IBM's <a href="http://jikes.sourceforge.net/">Jikes</a>,
and
<a href="http://www.ikvm.net/">IKVM.net</a>.
<a href="http://www.ikvm.net/">IKVM.net</a> implements Java on the
.NET framework (implemented by Microsoft and by
<a href="http://www.mono-project.com/Main_Page">Mono</a>).
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/classpath/stories.html#jvm">
GNU Classpath provides a long list of Java Virtual Machine implementations
that use GNU Classpath</a>.
The
<a href="http://www.fosdem.org/2005/index/dev_room_classpath/schedule">
FOSDEM 2005 conference included a discussion between such projects</a>
so they could work out remaining issues.
For example,
<a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/ml/java/2005-02/msg00145.html">
There's work on streamlining the interactions between gcj and Classpath,</a>
eliminating some unnecessary redundancies.

<b>Warning:</b> Below is an old list of Java implementations.
However, the text below is now very out-of-date, and I don't have
time to keep up right now.
The list below isn't limited to OSS/FS implementations, nor is it
intended to be.
But, you might find it useful, so here it is.

<p><b><font size=+3>Introduction: What's Java?</font></b>
<p><a href="http://www.sun.com">Sun Microsystems</a> has developed
a set of technologies called <a href="http://webopedia.internet.com/TERM/j/Java.html" target="_blank">Java
</a>(TM).
Using Java you can create various kinds of programs including traditional
applications and "applets" that automatically run when a user views a web
page. Many users are very attracted to Java's goal of&nbsp; "write once,
run anywhere" (WORA), that is, using this technology the same program can
be highly portable and run on many different platforms (e.g. Windows, Mac,
Unix, and Linux). The Java technologies can be divided into four components:
<ol>
<li>
<i>The Java Virtual Machine (JVM) which runs class files</i>. The JVM is
an abstract computer that executes programs stored in "class" files. The
JVM can be implemented on real computers in many different ways, and that's
the point: as long as your computer faithfully recreates this abstract
computer, it can run programs stored in class files. For example, the JVM
might be implemented as an interpreter built into a web browser, or as
a separate program that interprets the class files. Your computer could
implement the JVM by transforming the class files into an executable program
specific for that machine just before running them (this is called a "just-in-time"
compiler). In fact, your computer hardware might implement the&nbsp; JVM
directly. As long as you have an implementation of the JVM, you can run
Java programs, compiled into class files. Class files are also called <a href="http://webopedia.internet.com/TERM/b/bytecode.html" target="_blank">bytecode</a>
files.</li>

<li>
<i>The Java language</i>. The Java language is an object oriented computer
programming language that resembles C++ and Objective-C in syntax, with
its semantics being more like a cross between Ada (for typesafety) and
Smalltalk. It supports automatic garbage collection and single inheritance
(with multiple inheritance of interfaces) but lacks enumerations and templates.</li>

<li>
<i>A compiler that generates class files</i>. The JVM runs class files,
so you need a way to create them. Sun has developed a compiler that takes
programs written in the Java language and generates Java class files. Other
vendors have also developed compilers that generate class files. Note that
you don't need to use the Java language to generate Java class files.</li>

<li>
<i>The Java library</i>. The Java technology includes a set of components
for a platform-independent graphical user interface (GUI) as well as other
useful components.</li>
</ol>
Sometimes the terminology can rather confusing. Many people, including
Sun, use the term "Java" for each of these different components and for
the technology as a whole. You'll need to determine what they mean by its
context. The key point is that when people "run a Java program", they're
actually running a set of class files on their version of the JVM.
<p>
Note: the term "Java" is trademarked by Sun.
For purposes of this page, "Java" will also include anything implementing
(or trying to implement) Sun's specifications of Java, but this is not
intended to infringe on the status of Sun's trademark.
<br>&nbsp;
<p>
<p><b><font size=+3>Java History</font></b>
<p>Java is an outgrowth of the Green Project which was started in 1990
by Patrick Naughton, Mike Sheridan, and James Gosling. The idea was simply
to plan and anticipate the "next wave" in computing. Initially, it was
called Oak after a tree outside of James Gosling's office. However, that
name was in use by another product from a different company so the name
Java was used.&nbsp; The technology quickly caught on and Java was christened
on May 23 of 1993 when Netscape Navigator agreed to make Java a part of
its browser software. Today, Java is bigger than ever. It is integral part
of the leading web browsers (Internet Explorer and Netscape Navigator)
and can run applications on nearly every modern operating system.
<p>However, one thing that we would like to make clear, is that Java is
not something which is terribly new. Contrary to what Sun says, virtual
machines existed in the 1980s in UCSD p-code, and researchers have been
discussing mobile code for years. Still, Java productized these well.
<p><b><font size=+3>Why <i>not</i> Sun?</font></b>
<p>Of course, you can always download the current Java Development Kit
(JDK) from Sun's <a href="http://www.javasoft.com">Javasoft</a> and if
you are just learning Java that may be the simplest thing to do. However,&nbsp;
there may be several reasons why you would want software from someone else:

<ol>
<li><b>You want to use <a href="http://www.opensource.org/osd.html">open source</a> /
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html">free software</a>
technology:</b>
When you download from Sun you must agree to a <a href="http://www.javasoft.com/j2se/1.3/j2sdk1_3_0.license">license</a>
which states that you are not allowed to modify or redistribute the software
except under special conditions.&nbsp; If you are a developer, you may
want something that you can modify, port, and so on.
You may also not want some other organization to have that much control
over your infrastructure.
In our list, we have specified which packages are open source, including
those that are <a href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html" target="_blank">GPL</a>
(GNU Public License) or <a href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/lesser.html" target="_blank">LGPL</a>
(Lesser GNU Public License).
For more information, you can see the
<a href="http://www.opensource.org">Open Source Initiative web site</a>, the
<a href="http://www.fsf.org">Free Software Foundation</a>,
<a href="http://www.dwheeler.com/oss_fs_refs.html">Open Source Software / Free Software References</a>, and
<a href="http://www.dwheeler.com/oss_fs_why.html">Quantitative Measures</a>.


<li><b>You would prefer to write in another language:</b>
As stated before you do not need to write Java source code to be able
to create bytecode.&nbsp; We list here several compilers which take source
code from a different language and compile it to bytecode.

<li><b>You would like increased performance:</b>
One of the key problems with the Java virtual machine is that performance
(i.e., speed) may suffer.
For many applications, perhaps performance is not important, but for
other applications it's quite important.
Sun's original Java implementation performed security checks on
code every time it was loaded, and then it interpreted byte codes
one-by-one.
More recently, some implementations include a ``just-in-time'' compiler
which quickly compiles at least some of the code before it's executing
(various heuristics may be used to try to determine what should be compiled).
Some Java implementations take a more traditional (``ahead-of-time'')
approach: they take the Java source code or byte code and
compile it to machine-specific native code.
This code will work faster (especially since the compiler can spend more
time optimizing its results); note that the native code
will only work on that kind of machine.
Some systems support a hybrid approach:
you can compile most code ahead-of-time, but
dynamically load code and have them call each other.
Note that some required portions of the Java language and byte code
(e.g., garbage collection) may make it very difficult for a Java program
to be equal in performance to a well-tuned C/C++ program;
the extent of this difference is often debated.

<li><b>Sun doesn't have a Java Development Kit (JDK) for your platform</b>
Clearly you can't just download from Sun if you are in this boat.
Sun's Java implementation is available on
<a href="http://webopedia.internet.com/TERM/M/Microsoft_Windows.html">Windows</a>
95/98/NT, <a href="http://webopedia.internet.com/TERM/S/Solaris.html">Solaris</a>,
<a href="http://webopedia.internet.com/TERM/L/Linux.html">Linux</a>
(x86 only),
and several other platforms.
The
<a href="http://www.blackdown.org/java-linux/ports.html">
Blackdown team tries to port this to other platforms</a>.
However, your platform may not be supported -
embedded developers often fit in this category.

currently used by the majority of all users. You will get a complete implementation,
including a compiler, virtual machine, and library. Many of the binaries
are available at no charge but you are not allowed to make copies or redistribute
them. They do offer some of the source code for reference purposes only.
You might think twice about looking at the source code though if you want
to be considered a "clean" developer of another implementation, i.e., someone

it to write regular applications and applets.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; TransVirtual claims its
Virtual Machine is several times faster than Sun's and that it is only
30% slower than vanilla C. They offer AWT and Swing support. There is corporate
interest in Kaffe:

<a href="http://www.transvirtual.com/products/schlumberger.html">Schlumberger</a>
and <a href="http://www.transvirtual.com/products/whistle.html">Whistle</a>
have used it for various applications. However, there are also a number
of drawbacks; Kaffe does not have many security features that Sun's implementation
does, including a bytecode verifier and honoring public/private access
modifiers. It does not support the Java 2 security model including stack
inspection and code signing.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Kaffe was written by

Mehlitz.</a>&nbsp; Be aware that there are two distinct versions of Kaffe.
The desktop edition is licensed under the GPL, so you can't use it in a
proprietary project. However, TransVirtual also offers a custom edition
which can be licensed to you for use in a propietary project. This is mirrored
by the two different web sites. From the company website, (<a href="http://www.transvirtual.com">TransVirtual</a>)&nbsp;
you may either obtain the Desktop edition or the Custom edition. From the
<a href="http://www.kaffe.org/">Kaffe.org</a>
site you may only obtain the Open Desktop edition. In general, the .org
site is more oriented toward other developers, and interested parties who
might feel like contributing to the project, and the .com site is more
oriented towards companies who might use Kaffe for their projects.&nbsp;
Kaffe.org has made it clear that your contributions to the GPL version
will not be used in the custom edition without your permission.

This package comes with Microsoft's Java compiler

This was part of a
<a href="http://microsoftsoft.about.com/compute/microsoftsoft/msubMSvsSun.htm">lawsuit</a>
between Microsoft and Sun.
After 3 years, the lawsuit was finally resolved in January 2001.
The resolution was not really a surprise, according to InfoWorld
(Januar 29, 2001), since
it didn't appear that Microsoft was in a position to win the case.
Basically, Microsoft blatantly violated Sun's trademark by repeatedly placing
Sun's Java logo on software that failed to meet Sun's compatibility testing,
in violations of their contract.
Many believe
Microsoft didn't want to meet the compatibility tests since a compatible
Java implementation would enable the same Java software to
run on both Microsoft and non-Microsoft platforms.
As a result of the court decision,
Microsoft has to pay $20 million to Sun, Microsoft
will not receive future Java licenses,
Microsoft is under a permanent injunction against the use of the
Java-compatible logo, and only the existing inventory of Java 1.1.14
can be distributed (under a limited license that expires in seven years).
<!-- Source: "A Line in the Sand: Sun, Microsoft dig in heels on Java",
     by Tom Sullivan and Ed Scannell, InfoWorld, January 29, 2001,

In response, Microsoft is trying to get developers to switch to
Microsoft's proprietary ".NET" program and Microsoft's own "C#" language;
how successful this will be is yet to be seen.

listed them here.

<p><a NAME="Harissa"></a><a href="http://www.irisa.fr/compose/harissa/harissa.html">Harissa</a>,
<a href="http://www.irisa.fr/accueil/index_uk.htm">Irisa</a>&nbsp;
-- Compiles bytecode to C and inclues a small support library. Developed
at a French University this research prototype is at version alpha3.1c.
The last change occurred in January 1999. Harissa only supports JDK 1.0.2.
<p><a NAME="Toba"></a><a href="http://www.cs.arizona.edu/sumatra/toba/">Toba</a>,
<a href="http://www.cs.arizona.edu/">University
of Arizona</a>&nbsp; -- Translates Java class files into C source code.
The current version of Toba is 1.1c which was released in mid April of
1999. The link to license info about the software appears to be dead, also
current development on this project has ceased. It may still may have some
useful nuggets for other projects though.
