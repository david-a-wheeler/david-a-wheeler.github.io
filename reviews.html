<h1 class="title">Reviews of Books, Movies, and Other Stuff</h1>
<h2 class="author">David A. Wheeler</h2>

<p>
Here are reviews of random books, movies, and other media.
I certainly don't agree with everything in the media below, but if they
encourage me to think new thoughts, they are interesting to me.
The ones I find really interesting and recommend reading/seeing
I've marked with "!!!!".
<p>
I've certainly read many more books, and seen many more movies, than
what's listed below.
I just don't have time to comment on all of it,
and I've only just started to put this page together.
But perhaps you'll find pointers to interesting media here, even though
this is quite incomplete.
<p>
Oh, I've included links so you can immediately go to Amazon.com and buy them
in some cases.
If you buy it by following the link, I get a small cut -
which I then use to buy more books.
So if you <i>do</i> follow a link and buy it, my thanks in advance!

<h1>Science Fiction, Fantasy, and Alternate History</h1>
<p>
<ul>
<li><i>The Lord of the Rings (The Fellowship of the Ring, The Two Towers,
and The Return of the King)</i> and <i>The Hobbit</i> by J.R.R. Tolkein,
as well as the Peter Jackson movies based on them, are fabulous.
'Nuf said. !!!!!
<li><i>Foundation Series
(Foundation, Foundation and Empire, Second Foundation)</i> by Isaac Asimov.
Old and good.
The premise is that Hari Seldon develops a science (psychohistory)
that can predict future human events, then uses that to establish
"foundations" to change those future events.
Later books in the series were (in my opinion) lousy.  !!!!!

This is an alternate history series in which the inhabitants of a
small town in West Virginia ("Grantville")
are transported back to Central Germany, May 1631, with no way back.
This thing is a <i>riot</i> - it's a lot of fun.
Basically, the people of Grantville decide to start the American Revolution
150 years early, and it's a fun intellectual exercise to figure out what
modern technology works in this setting... and what doesn't.
This is actually the beginning of a huge number of books and stories, written
by many people, which are both fact and fiction:

Note that 1632 is <i>not</i> for kids; there's more than a little gore,

<h1>History and Society</h1>
<p>
History presented as a "list of facts" is worthless.
But analysis of history to explain what happened (examining cause and effect),
sufficient that it can help us understand the present, predict the future,
or tell us what we should do next, is deeply interesting.
If a book has a theory that explains (parts of) the past and
predicts the future (think psychohistory), then it's an
especially interesting book to me.

This book posits a simple theory
that each human generation belongs to one of four types,
and that these types repeat sequentially in a fixed pattern.
It then examines U.S. history to see if this theory models U.S. history well,
and the book is an extraordinary good case that it <i>does</i> model it well.

by Bernard Lewis.
A fascinating (and saddening) examination of the Islamic world.
He describes an ossified culture, often unable to deal with modernity,
and where violent men advocate even more retreat from modernity
in the perverse belief that it would help.
Every trivial issue seems to be controlled by jurists' rulings, and
constantly prevents them from taking up even many small improvements.
(For centuries they couldn't even stay in the West to learn from them,
and even now rulings seem to forbid critical improvements and freedoms.)
According to Lewis,
freedom of thought is quite limited; religious minorities have been
tolerated, but not in Saudi Arabia, and
though there's a verse about not compelling someone into a religion,
it's a capital punishment to leave the muslim faith (those who try, or tell
muslims about other faiths, are killed).
Political freedom is unavailable in most such countries also.
A small example is illuminating:
wheeled vehicles, commonly used in the area before Islam,
gradually went out of use in Islamic Middle Eastern countries until
they were re-introduced by the West.
"This was a symptom of a bigger problem.  A cart is large and,
for a peasant, relatively costly.  It is difficult to conceal and
easy to requisition.  At a time and place where neither
law nor custom restricted the power of even local authorities,
visible and mobile assets were a poor investment.
The same fear of predatory authority - or neighbors - may be seen in the
structure of traditional houses and narrow alleyways, the careful
avoidance of any visible sigh of wealth...
the advent of paved roads and wheeled vehicles in
modern times brought no alleviation of the larger problems" (p. 157-158).
Indeed, the whole notion of separation of church and state is completely
absent from their thinking (with notable exceptions, such as Turkey which
is doing comparatively well).
Blaming the U.S. or Israel is common, yet they appear to be mere scapegoats;
they didn't even exist before the area's decline.
<p>
"To a Western observer, schooled in the theory and practice of
Western freedom, it is precisely the lack of freedom - freedom
of the mind from constraint and indoctrination,
to question and inquire and speak;
freedom of the economy from corrupt and pervasive mismanagement;
freedom of women from male oppression;
freedom of citizens from tyranny - that underlies so many of the
troubles of the Muslim world.  But the road to democracy, as the
Western experience amply demonstrates, is long and hard, full of
pitfalls and obstacles.
If the peoples of the Middle East continue on their present path,
the suicide bomber may become a metaphor for the whole region,
and there will be no escape from a downward spiral of hate and spite,
rage and self-pity, poverty and oppression, culminating sooner or
later in yet another alien domination... For the time being,
the choice is their own." !!!!!

by Milton Viorst.
It takes a whirlwind view of history, so at time it can be a little
rough to follow, but it's very good at noticing the many failures on
all sides, and the repeated lost opportunities.
There's a particularly nice inight on page 127, discussing 1963:
"The three most powerful Arab states - Nasser's Egypt, Syria, and Iraq -
were committed to a Pan-Arab ideology.  So, apparently, were the Arab masses.
Yet the unification that had once seemed inevitable never occurred...
Each of the Arab countries held firm to its own national identity.
Pan-Arabism's failure demonstrated that Arabs could pledge their bond to
the Arab community, to the <i>umma</i>, while at the same time
embracing the nationalism of the state in which they lived...
Arabs were at ease in the 1960s giving their loyalty to Pan-Arabism as an
ideology, without surrendering their identity as Iraqis, Syrians, or
Egyptians.  Most seem to feel that way today."
Another quotable is on page 133: "Arabs had no good explanation for the
disaster of 1967 and many took the easy route of blaming... the West.
A few brave thinkers adopted the unpopular position that Arabs should
look for the blame within themselves, or at least within their culture.
But Arab society, historically resistant to change, is not by nature
introspective.  Arabs were generally unwilling to upset conventional
values, so many of them rooted in history and Islam.
The catastrophe produced little in the way of useful insights."
Page 153: "[In the 1980s] Islamic nationalists from around the world
mobilized in Afghanistan [against the USSR]... though not quite
admitting the U.S. as their ally, they gladly accepted American weapons...
Thanks in large part to the United States, the Afghan coalition
emerged victorious."
Page 165, on why democracy is not working in Iraq:
"To succeed, democracy requires individuals to make their own judgements.
Sectarianism, tribalism, and regionalism are its enemies... few
Iraqis voted as individuals.  Shi'ites voted as Shi'ites, Sunnis as
Sunnis, Kurds as Kurds... the elections provided no advancement toward
a stable society..."
Page 174, "The solution may well lie in the president's willingness
to turn to the Arab community for help.
The Arab states, every one of them volatile, recognize the jeopardy they
themselves face in Iraq... [they] share with America an interest
in keeping Iraq's society and territorial integrity intact."

by Jared Diamond is stupendously interesting.
He explains that many events of history - particularly the rise of the West
over societies like those in the Americas and Papua New Guinea -
are well-explained by examining the resources available to them.
He also pleas for the creation of a "science of history", in which the
scientific method is used to create theories of causation that can be tested
(he's arguing for something like "psychohistory" in Asimov's Foundation
series, though surprisingly never mentions that).
One problem with this book is that it doesn't sufficiently admit
the strong impact on history from areas other than environment,
such as human ideas/culture
(think Middle Eastern Islam vs. European Christianity),
and stupendously gifted individuals (think Alexander the Great).
Perhaps that's necessary; he's trying to find all important causes <i>not</i>
due to these things, and by putting on such blinders, he manages to delve deep.
In any case, it's really insightful, and worth a read.

<i>Wars, Guns, and Votes: Democracy in Dangerous Places</i>
by Paul Collier.
Coolier's book quantitatively examines the serious problems of power
and endless political violence in the nations
of the "bottom billion" (low-income countries that are caught in one
of four development traps, such as Afghanistan and Zimbabwe).
Instead of making knee-jerk assumptions, he tries to quantitatively
analyze a whole host of political questions, and the results are intriguing.
A few samplers should give an idea.
<p>
In chapter 1, he shows that in countries where the annual per capita
income is $2700 or greater, a democracy tends to less political violence
than an autocracy.
But where the per capita income is less, democracies 
(defined merely as "had an election") tend to have <i>more</i>
violence, for a variety of reasons.
Personally, I think his definition of "democracy" is too weak
(it does not include "rule of law" or
"protection of the rights of minorities") but I see his point.
It also shows why, for many of these leaders, miscounting the vote
(often combined with other dirty tricks) is so tempting.
<p>
In chapter 3 he examines ethnic politics.
Discussions on policy choices get crowded out by identity politics,
and identity politics also leads to polarized results.
Many studies have found that ethnic diversity causes systemically worse
public services (it's causal, not just correlated).
The basic problem is that people are more willing to trust people from their
own ethnic group, and trust is necessary for public services.
Interestingly, diversity causes an <i>advantage</i> in private economic
activity in higher-income nations;
diversity raises team productivity (presumably
because of its increase in the range of skills, perspectives, and so on).
On page 60, he makes an intriguing claim:
"This is clearly consistent with the contrast between America and Europe;
the as yet more homogenous societies of Europe
have a larger public sector".
Unfortunately, the "beneficial effects of diversity only set in at
higher levels of income".
<p>
His analysis of civil war (in chapter 5)
is interesting; rather than focusing on the causes,
he presumes that there will always be <i>someone</i> in a country that
has a grievance, and then primarily focuses on how prone
that country is to having a civil war based on its circumstances.
A country is at a greater risk for civil war if it is
poor with a low growth rate, unsurprisingly.
Another risk is being dependent on natural resources
(e.g., Angola diamonds); they provide a ready source of rebel financing,
provide something to fight over, and enable the government to function
without taxing citizen income (gradually detaching the government from
what citizens want).
Ethnic diversity, religious diversity, a large proportion of men
aged 15-25, and a history with previous civil wars all increase the risk
of civil war.
The presence of forests didn't matter, but the presence of mountains did:
Mountains greatly increased the risk of civil war
(as they provide ready-made hideouts for rebels).
Surprisingly, its colonial experience tends to have little to do with the
risk of civil war.
<p>
"Conventionally, the governments of the bottom billion are
regarded as internationally powerless... they see themselves as still
entrapped by the bullying of more powerful nations.
I think that this victim-bully imagery has been hugely disfunctional.
It has masked a radically different reality: individually, the governments
of the bottom billion have too much sovereignty, not too little...
they have seldom formed forged strong national identities to compete
with their ancient social identifiers of ethnicity and religion.
As a result, thought too small for security, they are
too large for the social cohesion that is hugely helpful for the
provision of public goods." (page 198-199).
He thne makes a very controverial claim
that the emphasis on "national sovereignty" is often
a smokescreen in these countries:
"the most enduring legacy of the colonial experience is the
excessive respect given... to the notion of national sovereignty.
In reality, the typical society of the bottom billion does not have national
sovereignty.  It has yet to become a nation
as opposed to a state: so it lacks the cohesion needed to produce effective
restraints upon either the the conduct of the electrions or the
subsequent power of the winner.
As a result, it [merely] has <i>presidential</i> sovereignty.
No wonder presidents are jealous of national sovereignty: they are
jealous of their own power." (page 200).

<p>
Perhaps most interesting, but most controversial, is where he tries to
use these analysis to prescribe solutions.
These nations are often too small to provide many services, but
merging or effective multinational cooperation are
simply impractical in most cases for them.
His "proposal 1" (page 202) would be for providing a "powerful carrot"
for such governments that sign up for a voluntary international standard
for fair elections, and that "powerful carrot" would for the international
community to commit itself to reinstate (by force) that elected government
should a coup d'etat occur.
I think this would have to be done case-by-case, where done.
While it's all well and good to say "rich countries should help poor ones",
that's the same as saying "your children should die for foreigners
without benefit to your country", and that is correctly a harder argument.
Also, I think there would need to be other conditions; at the very least,
the "opposition" party members would need to be guaranteed safe
(else the "winners" are likely to kill off their opposition, a sad and
repetitive tale).
He has two other proposals:
"Enforcing probity in public spending"
(ensuring that money is well spent) and
"international supply of security".
Earlier in the book, he also notes approvingly of something else that works:
Building a sense of national identity.
On page 66-68, he discusses Indonesia and Tanzania, where they focused on

<i>Lies My Teacher Told Me:
Everything Your High School History Texbook Got Wrong</i> by
James W. Loewen.
This book focuses on errors and deliberate omissions in history textbooks,
as well as the whole omission of controversy and the use of the
"authoritative" tone that makes history textbooks so bad.
I agree with him that history should not be taught as facts and dates
to memorize. I believe that history must concentrate on analyzing
the causes and effects of important events, ideas, and people; though
he'd say things differently I think we'd agree on that.
Some of his arguments aren't persuasive to me. E.g., he says that textbooks
routinely omit the fact that Native American cultures swiftly feel to the
Europeans because most of them died from European diseases

(95% in many places).
I agree that's critically important, and apparantly many books he looked at
didn't note it, but I certainly recall knowing that information in high school;
clearly this "lie of omission" is getting out somehow.
I also knew that Columbus absolutely conquered the natives
in horrific fashion where he arrived - there's no secret there.
His obvious strong leftish political beliefs lead him to imply things as
"truth" that I certainly wouldn't agree.
He seems excessively fixated on class, seems to believe that no one can
ever better their circumstance, and his tone implies that he
believes that any difference in income between people is morally wrong.
Yes, there are certainly major income disparities, but
if you want to see class structures <i>really</i> in action,
examine rural India or 17th century England, where it is/was
<i>not possible</i> to change your circumstance no matter what.
In Democracy in America (1835), Alexis de Tocqueville marvelled at how 
in the U.S. people had much more equality of social conditions than elsewhere;
it wasn't fully equal then or now, but it still provides more opportunities
than most.
Because Loewen is concentrating on "lies", he ends up with an
angry tone that manages to concentrate on the bad things in U.S. history -
not the good things that have made it great
(he does mention that briefly, but the mention doesn't really counteract it).
The result is quite lopsided.
His claim that everyone should spend time arguing stuff in class is
less persuasive; there's not enough time already, it's hard to argue
issues until you understand the facts, and there's plenty of
causes and effects that <i>are</i> understood and agreed upon that
can be covered.
You can cover debates without having a free-for-all; just explain the
different viewpoints even-handedly (Wikipedia's policies show it's hard
but possible).
Still, this book is a useful antidote to the many history
textbooks that omit "uncomfortable" truths in U.S. history.
Certainly it makes sense to
scrap the current set of history books (which have boatloads of errors),
and replace them with texts that emphasize what's actually important,
ideas, causes and effects, primary sources (with many long quotes from them),
and accuracy.

The Company: A Short History of a Revolutionary Idea
by John Micklethwait and Adrian Wooldridge.
This book is a "history" of the modern
limited-liability, joint stock companies, and it's
interesting on several levels.
First, it's a history about one of the most influential ideas of modern
times, that nevertheless doesn't normally get examined as its own history
(companies are legally a fictional person... so why not treat their
history the same way?).
Indeed, the book claims that "the most important organization in the
world is the company [not the state, commune, or political party]."
Though business has been going on for a long time, the full-fledged
limited-liability joint stock company only dates from the mid-1800s... and
it's completely taken over.
Second, it turns out that many of the issues discussed today about
modern multinationals aren't new... they've been raised for a long time.
President Rutherford B. Hayes: "This is a government of the people,
by the people, and for the people no longer... it is a government of
corporations, by corporations and for corporations."
Edward I in 1279 issued the Statute of Mortmain, to stem the
flow of assets to the "dead hand" of corporate bodies.
The conflict between owners and the company managers (agents), known as
the "agency problem", has been discussed and never fully solved right
from their beginning.
<p>
Yet the authors do a good job arguing that companies have actually
become (on average) more ethical, more humane, more socially responsible
than in the past; they also argue that the concept of the company
has been one of the West's great competitive advantages.
Indeed, they strongly make the point (page 186) that
"the modern company still needs a franchise from society, and the
terms of that franchise still matter enormously.
From the company's point of view, two clouds have gathered...
corporate scandals and... social responsibility."
Companies now often do good works, in part because they fear what will 
happen if they do not.
And perhaps the best thing about companies is that they have developed
ways to create products and services that are far more affordable than they
were before, giving wealth to us all.
<p>
Ronald Coase's 1937 article "The Nature of the Firm" argues that
the main reason why a company exists is because it minimizes the
transaction costs of coordinating a particular economic activity;
bring all the people in-house, and you reduce the costs of
"negotiating and concluding a separate contract for each exchange transaction."
But these gains must be balanced against "hierarchy costs" -
the costs of central managers ignoring dispersed information.
This is interesting to consider when examining open source software projects,
which also enable coordination of economic activity, and tend to use
wide-open mailing lists to counter hierarchy costs.

</i> by Clayton M. Christensen is startlingly good.
It describes how well-run companies can be completely destroyed by
disruptive technologies, <i>because</i> they are well-run.
Be careful: the term "disruptive technology" doesn't mean what a
<i>technologist</i> might think - a technology might be radically different
and risky, but sustaining and not disruptive given Christensen's definitions.
In his terminology, a disruptive technology is one where the innovation
results in worse product performance as traditionally measured in the near
term,
but they have other features that a few fringe (and generally new)
customers want... and have the potential to grow into eventually
providing adequate product performance.
"Products based on disruptive technologies are typically cheaper,
simpler, smaller, and, frequently, more convenient to use."
Since the customers for such products are new, and typically small, the
"big guys" won't serve them... yet those who do will grow the technology
until it's sufficiently capable to upset the established players.
It doesn't have to be <i>better</i> under the old measures - just good
enough, and with other advantages (such as being much cheaper or flexible).
Eventually the upstarts grow the technology until it's a threat to the
"big guy" - by that point it's too late, and the "big guy" vanishes. !!!!!

by Kirk Cheyfitz.
Good overview of the fundamentals for running a business.
It's all too easy to chase after fads in business, and that's a mistake.
This is an antidote, focusing on the basics: profits, cash flow, 
cutting expenses is always more certain than increasing sales,
customers are boss, hiring smart (instead of managing hard),
results are more important than process, and so on.

<i>The undercover economist: exposing why the rich are rich, the poor are poor, and why you can never buy a decent used car</i>
by Tim Harford.
This book is really much more about the big picture of economics, and
how to apply that insight, than an attempt to justify weird things.
This is <i>much</i> better than Freakonomics - I find his
explanations and justifications much more compelling, as well as easier
to apply broadly.
<li>
<i>Freakonomics</i> by Steven D. Levitt and Stephen J. Dubner.
This is okay, but
I wasn't as impressed by this book as some others are.
Its basic idea is that you can answer interesting questions about how
people <i>really</i> behave (not how they <i>say</i> they behave)
by studying quantitative data.  Well, yes, but that's not new.
What's more interesting about the book is the various questions they ask,
which certainly cover many different areas, and the
way that they find and analyze numbers to get their answers.
Some of the questions they ask and answer are interesting, e.g.,
"Why do drug dealers still live with their moms?" (the answer: only a very
few dealers make all the money; the rest make nearly nothing, but do it
anyway in the hopes of becoming the few rich ones).
Their claims that abortions reducing crime aren't as strongly supported,
I think and of course just because people do something
doesn't suddenly make it right.
Which brings me to another point.
They discuss how they caught cheating teachers, who rigged kids'
answers to make their classrooms appear more effective... by analyzing
the class answers to find evidence of cheating.
Since I work to analyze stuff quantitatively where possible, this was
certainly not new or eye-opening... but if you haven't thought about
how to analyze real life, this might be an interesting book.

by Art Spiegelman.
"Maus" is really good - it even won a Pulitzer prize.
It's a non-fiction graphic novel that tells two stories:
the story of how his father survived the World War II holocaust,
and the story of the relationship between father and son.
I have the two-volume bookset, though it's now published as a single work.
It is poignant and deep.
The story of his father's survival through a combination of incredible
presence of mind and luck is gripping (and disturbing).
But the more-recent timeframe lets the author explore a lot of
the complications that are really hard to express.
Some people are fooled into thinking that this is a work of fiction,
because as an artistic convension he depicts all the people
with animal heads (mice for Jews, cats for Germans, pigs for Poles,
dogs for Americans, and so on).
He really starts to exploit and make fun of this convention as he goes,
poking fun at our stereotypes.
This is one of those "you must read this before you die" books.

</i> by Dr. Warren Farrell.
This is definitely <i>not</i> politically correct, but it <i>is</i> full
of detailed studies and statistics that don't seem to be discussed elsewhere.
Many claim that "women earn less than men doing the same thing", but
according to the data gathered into this book, that's wrong --
instead, women tend to not do "the same thing".
Past studies only compared titles, which often turns out to be very misleading.
By digging deeper, Farrell has found that
women tend to make choices that lead to lower pay, so they tend to not
do the same thing in the first place!
When women <i>intentionally</i> make such trade-offs, that's great,
but often women seem to make choices <i>without</i> realizing that
they are choosing the lower-paying options.
He uses lots of statistics and stories to show what it takes to earn more.
Higher-paying fields tend to involve
technology (vs. arts or social sciences), hazards,
sleet and heat (vs.  indoors and neat) when little education is required, 
work you can't "check out" from at the end of the day,
work with lower personal fulfillment (engineer vs. child care),
higher financial/emotional risks, the worst hours, unpleasant environments,
ones that require constant updating, and specialized subfields.
To make more money, you need to work more hours than others,
have more relevant years of experience, and be absent less often.
People who relocate tend to make more.
And of course, taking on bigger responsibility, requiring less security,
and producing more all tends to result in more money coming back in.
This is not a victim's book, but really a book on "what can you do
to earn more".
He doesn't say this, but it all boils to down to <i>supply and demand</i> -
workers who are in high demand and short supply
(due to danger, difficulty of gaining the prerequisites, etc.)
tend to earn lots more!
Note that simply saying "the same field" isn't enough - the person willing
to relocate, or work for many more hours each week,
may have the "same" title as someone else but is
likely to be earning more money.
Frankly, all of these factors seemed obvious to me, but apparantly
these factors aren't obvious to many others.
Though there are many statistics in this book, one of the many
stories illustrates the point (p. 38): "While I was writing...
a Goodwill rep called to cancel a pickup at my home...
the driver said it was too dangerous for her to travel
with her truck down the narrow, curving streets to my home...
A year or so later I called again and Goodwill came. No problem.
But also no woman driver."
There are also some interesting comments about military service that,
if true, are very concerning if you want a
military to <i>win</i> instead of being politically correct (PC).
This isn't a book justifying paying women less; quite the contrary, it's
a guidebook for women so that they can be sure they fully understand
the impacts of their choices,
which in my mind is the best idea.
Money is <i>not</i> the be-all; in many cases it's a <i>good</i> idea
to forgo money for something more important to you, and it can give you peace 
of mind if you understand your choices.
It's actually a pretty interesting book for men trying to make
income trade-offs, too.
It's not PC, but it's a compelling case, and certainly mind-opening.
Very interesting.

</i> by Bevin Alexander.
The author claims that there are 13 rules which win wars
(striking at enemy weakness, feigning retreat, and so on).
He then devotes a chapter to each rule, describing the rule and various
battles that illustrate it.
He's very insightful on some of his comments, though I don't completely agree
with some of his prognostications.
His rules, though, are very sensible for explaining the past.
His rules are:
striking at enemy weakness, defend then attack, holding one place (and)
striking another, feigned retreat, the central position
(this one is really surprising), employing a superior weapon
(though too many generals have mistakenly thought they had one),
driving a stake in the enemy's heart,
blocking the enemy's retreat, landing an overwhelming blow,
stroke at a weak spot, caldron battles,
uproar east (then) attack west, and manuevers on the rear.
He includes not just successes, but failures to apply these principles.
For example, he notes that Germany in World War II needed oil, and
if they took the Soviet's oil fields (in the Caucasus and along the shores
of the Caspian sea) it would cripple the Soviet Union while strengthening
Germany.  Yet Hitler required his soldiers to do both that <i>and</i>
seize Stalingrad - hundreds of miles away, and completely unnecessary if
his goal (as stated) was to stop the flow of oil (capturing the Caucasus
would have done that too!).
By dividing his strength, he failed to do either.
Of course, much of this is not new (Sun Tzu said in the 5th century
"make an uproar in the east, but attack in the west"), but it's an
interesting summary.



<li><i>Born on a Blue Day: A Memoir</i> by Daniel Tammet.
This is an autobiography by Daniel Tammet, an extraordinary autistic savant
who can describe (to a limited degree) what is going on in his own mind.
He has extraordinary gifts (he's able to learn Icelandic in a week,
memorize Pi to over 22,000 places, and so on) yet other things
(like living independently of his parents) is very hard for him.
To me, what's especially intriguing is that he perceives each number specially,
i.e., 11 is friendly, 4 is both shy and quiet, 23 is big, 333 is beautiful,
117 is tall and lanky, 9 is towering and filled with immensity.
And it's great that he's managed to at least partially
overcome his difficulties to live his own life.
Parts are not for children (he talks briefly
but directly about his homosexuality).
I first learned of Tammet through the documentary <i>Brainman</i>,
which is interesting as well.

Other books I've read recently:
"Are we Rome?" by Cullen Murphy

"Save the Males" by Kathleen Parker
is another non-PC book.
Page 39: "I don't intend to blame all our ills on feminism...
but we can't ignore the role feminism played in helping shape our
attitudes toward hearth and home.
What is feminism if not antipatriarchy?
Who is Father if not a patriarch?"
It points out that modern Western culture tends to wallow in male-bashing
(presuming that all things are the men's fault, presuming men are stupid,
etc.), with horrific effects on everyone.
The horrible impact on children lacking fathers is well-documented;
girls are more likely to become promiscuous, while boys are
more likely to engage in violent behavior and promiscuity
(page 44-45).
The book notes that the fact that we have to ask what manliness is
"suggests that something has gone awry in the garden.
In his book <i>Manliness</i>, Harvard professor Harvey Mansfield
distilled manliness to 'confidence in the face of risk' and
an 'easy assumption of authority.' ...
manliness really has more to with attitude ... It isn't
about size, brute strength, aggression...
The hypermasculine male and our attraction to him, in fact,
may be a reaction to the feminizing trend in popular culture.
Is it possible that our yearning for the masculine is so profound
that we overreact when it's missing?
Or that we are drawn to exaggerated examples to compensate for the void?"
(page 109-110).

"The Richest Man in Babylon"
by George S. Clason
is an set of parables to clearly explain the basics of financial investment,
set in a form as if they were from Babylon.
They aren't, of course, but the format is really compelling anyway;
people have been teaching through stories for millenia, and
financial information often causes MEGO (my-eyes-glaze-over).
It's a nice book, frankly.
