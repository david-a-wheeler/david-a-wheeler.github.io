<p>
This is the home page of &#8220;The Definitive Four Fours Answer Key&#8221;
by David A. Wheeler.
I call it the &#8220;definitive&#8221; answer key, because at the time of this writing
it has more answers than anybody else for the &#8220;four fours&#8221; problem.
The goal of the four fours problem is to find a mathematical expression
for every integer from 0 to some maximum positive integer,
using only common mathematical
symbols and exactly four fours (no other digits are allowed).
For example, zero is 44-44, one is 44/44, 2 is 4/4+4/4, 3 is (4+4+4)/4,
and so on.
Since there are variations in what mathematical operations are allowed,
I created an &#8220;impurity index&#8221; for each expression; see the
paper for more information.
<p>
<h2>The answers</h2>
<p>
Currently, I list whole number answers from 0 up to 40,000.
<p>
<a href="fourfours.pdf">You can download the definitive
four fours answer key, with discussion, in PDF format</a>.
If you just want the answers, I also have them available in
<a href="fourfours.txt">ASCII text format</a>
(which lists the result, the impurity level, and the mathematical
expression).
Note that <b>these are large files</b>; both are over 1.6 Megabytes,
so don&#8217;t load these if you have a slow Internet connection.
<p>
If you just want a sampler of the answers, you can view the
<a href="fourfours-short.txt">abbreviated list of answers</a>; this
one is the ASCII text format of the answers from 0 to 1,000.
This sampler is only about 32K, and is better for those with slow Internet
connections.

<h2>Summary of assumptions</h2>
<p>
<p>
See the PDF version of the paper for a detailed description of
my assumptions.  However, here&#8217;s a quick summary of the
&#8220;impurity&#8221; levels.
The &#8220;zeroth&#8221; level allows
digit concatenation (e.g., &#8220;44&#8221;),
addition (+), subtraction/negation (-),
multiplication (*), division (/),
square root (sqrt(...)), factorial (!), and power (^).
Parentheses may be used for grouping.
The digit 4 must be used exactly four times, and the decimal digit (.)
can be used.
The higher impurity levels are:
<ul>
<li>2: The overline, an infinitely repeated digit.
    This is shown as a suffix ~ in ASCII text, so .4~ = 0.4444... = 4/9.
<li>3: An arbitrary root power. In ASCII I write this as root(A,B) which
    means B^(1/A); therefore, root(.4,4) = 4**(1./0.4) = 32.
    Note that some systems will use the other parameter order.
    I use this order because it&#8217;s the left-to-right order in traditional
    math notation and it&#8217;s the order required by TeX
    (in TeX, <tt>$\sqrt[p]{a}$</tt> is used to represent <tt>$a^{(1/p)}$</tt>).
<li>4: The gamma function; gamma(x) = (x-1)! when x is a positive integer.
    More generally, gamma(z) = integral of 0 to infinity of t^(x-1)*e^(-t) dt.
<li>5: %, a suffix meaning &#8220;divide by 100&#8221;.  So 4% = 0.04.
    I have only allowed this suffix after a constant number,
    so 4%, .4%, and .4~% are fine.
    However, I have NOT accepted it as a general &#8220;divide by 100&#8221; operation
    (as it is in spreadsheet functions), so expressions like sqrt(4)%
    are not used in the main list of answers.
    Also note that I would interpret (4/4)% as &#8220;1%&#8221;, not &#8220;100%&#8221; or &#8220;100&#8221;,
    even if I allowed that expression.
<li>6: The square function. In ASCII this is square(...), so square(4) = 16.
       In the PDF I use sq(...) instead because of limited space.
<li>7: logical-or, exclusive-or, and logical-and.
       In ASCII, exclusive-or is &#8220;xor&#8221;.
       I&#8217;m currently not actually using logical-or and logical-and, so
       that is more of a future idea than a current reality.
<li>8: logical left shift (&lt;&lt;) and right shift (&gt;&gt;).
</ul>
I always choose the solution with the
smallest impurity, then the fewest number of operations with that impurity
(concatenation does not count as an operator for the purpose of
counting operations).
Only exact answers are acceptable.
If the final result is an integer,
I have also (so far) strongly preferred answers
where all intermediate results are real numbers
(not complex numbers).
Up to this point I&#8217;ve also strongly preferred cases
where the factorial function is given an integer (you can always use gamma
for non-integers), though I can imagine relaxing that in the future.
Other than that, I arbitrarily pick a solution.
All such rules are arbitrary, of course; in particular, I&#8217;ve wondered
if I should have reversed the impurity order
for arbitrary roots and infinite digits,
and perhaps square should have a lower impurity.
However, I have to pick <i>some</i>
rules to play a game, and I hope you&#8217;ll accept them as reasonable rules.
<p>
Some of these solutions, such as 113 and 123, are incredibly difficult to find.
Here are my solutions for 113 and 123 (including their impurity levels):
<pre>
  113 (4) = gamma(gamma(4))-(4!+4)/4
  123 (0) = sqrt(sqrt(sqrt((sqrt(4)/.4)^4!)))-sqrt(4)
</pre>
<p>
(It turns out that
<a href="http://www.sciencecodex.com/search_for_element_113_concluded_at_last-99063">chemical element 113 is hard to find too</a>.)

<p>
<h2>Solutions from others</h2>
<p>
Some people have sent me additions.
<p>
Geoffrey Caveney has sent me an (almost) all gamma function solution for 113,
<tt>gamma(gamma(4))-gamma(4)-gamma(4/4)</tt>.
He also noted that since gamma(2)=1 there are several
"almost all gamma" solutions for 113, at least
<tt>(gamma(gamma(4))-gamma(4)-gamma(sqrt(4)))*gamma(sqrt(4))</tt>,
<tt>(gamma(gamma(4))-gamma(4)-gamma(sqrt(4)))/gamma(sqrt(4))</tt>,
and
<tt>(gamma(gamma(4))-gamma(4)-gamma(sqrt(4)))^gamma(sqrt(4))</tt>.

<p>
A special thank-you goes to Colin Harkins,
who reported a whole lot of additions to me in 2018!
I intend to fold them in eventually, but for now, they are:
<pre>

          using a negative exponent]
         He has another solution that interprets (4/4)% as "100", but I
         don't accept that approach and in any case I would interpret
         (4/4)% as 1% = 0.01, not as 100, even if I accepted it.

Colin Harkins:
All six numbers are created
using the same building block, which equals
375: 4! / sqrt(sqrt(sqrt(.4 ^ 4!)))
This can then be used to get 351, 371, 373, 377, 379, and 399, by
subtracting 4!, 4, sqrt(4), and adding sqrt(4), 4, and 4!, respectively. I
know the triple-root is kind of ugly, but it still allows for the numbers
to be calculated without gamma or other operators.

 	Thank you, it will be fun to brag to my friend who is also trying the
challenge at the same time! The way that I found them was that I figured
out that you could essentially cube any number using one extra four by
raising it to the power of 24 (i.e. 4!) and then subsequently adding three
square roots. [You can also raise them to the sixth and twelfth powers by
using only two or one radicals, but I haven't found much use for this.] I
haven't gone above 1,000, but by using this method you can make any cube of
a number that can be represented with three digits, or cube a number
represented by two fours and then subsequently adding an extra four. I also
got 343, 500, 705, 727, 731, 733, 753, 996, and 998 using this method. I
believe you have already included gamma-less representations for these
numbers though.

(.4repeating - .4), equal to 2/45

215: (4! * 4 - .4rep)/.4rep
299: ((√4 / .4)! – .4) / .4
343: √(√(√(((√(4 / .4) + √(4))^4!))) (This is essentially raising 7 to
the 24th power and then getting 7 cubed by taking the square root three
times).

<p>
In the paper I mention some possible extensions;
one possibility is using Euler's totient function phi(n).
Geoffrey Caveney investigated using this phi() function and shared a
number of observations with me.
First, he noted that no existing combination of functions and
operations seems to be able to express 2179, 2227, 2263, 2467, 2611,
etc., with four fours, while they can also be solved with phi.
He shows that the phi function can express 2304 with just one four:
gamma(4) = 6.
He then showed some other useful values that can be derived with phi,
including:
<pre>
sq(gamma(4)) = 36
phi(sq(gamma(4))) = 12
sq(phi(sq(gamma(4)))) = 144
phi(sq(phi(sq(gamma(4))))) = 48
sq(phi(sq(phi(sq(gamma(4)))))) = 2304
phi(4!) = 8
phi(gamma(gamma(4))) = 32
sq(phi(4!)) = 64
phi(sq(sq(4))) = 128
phi(gamma(4)!) = 192
phi(sq(sq(gamma(4)))) = 432
</pre>
In addition, he said that:
<blockquote>
It is also important to note that because phi(2^n) = 2^(n-1), any
power of 2 can be expressed with just one four, with the repeated
application of the square function followed by the repeated application
of the phi function. For example,<br>
phi(phi(phi(phi(phi(phi(phi(sq(sq(sq(4)))))))))) = 512<br>
phi(phi(phi(phi(phi(phi(sq(sq(sq(4))))))))) = 1024<br>
phi(phi(phi(phi(phi(sq(sq(sq(4)))))))) = 2048<br>
<br>
The expression for 2304 with one four in particular allows us to express the four smallest unsolved numbers with four fours:<br>
2179 = sq(phi(sq(phi(sq(gamma(4))))))-gamma(gamma(4))-sqrt(4)/.4<br>
2227 = sq(phi(sq(phi(sq(gamma(4))))))-phi(gamma(gamma(4)))-gamma(4)!/sq(4)<br>
2263 = sq(phi(sq(phi(sq(gamma(4))))))-sq(gamma(4))-4-gamma(sqrt(4))<br>
2467 = sq(phi(sq(phi(sq(gamma(4))))))+phi(sq(sq(4)))+sq(gamma(4))-gamma(sqrt(4))<br>
The next unsolved number requires somewhat more extensive use of the phi function:<br>
2611 = phi(phi(phi(phi(phi(sq(sq(sq(4))))))))+sq(4!)-phi(sq(gamma(4)))-gamma(sqrt(4))<br>
</blockquote>

<p>
In addition, here are solutions for some important non-integers
(here non-real complex numbers are just fine as intermediate results);
many were provided by others:
<pre>
pi (0) = (sqrt(4)/4)!^sqrt(4)*4 [Colin Harkins]
    This exploits the fact that (1/2)! = sqrt(pi)/2, which only works
    if you accept non-integer factorials (per the gamma function).
tau [2*pi] (4) = gamma(sqrt(4)/4)^sqrt(4)*sqrt(4) [Colin Harkins]
Golden ratio (4) = gamma(sqrt(4)+(sqrt(4)/.4))/sqrt(4) [Colin Harkins]
    This is based on the golden ratio's algebraic representation (1+sqrt(5))/2.
i (0) = sqrt(4-4-4/4) [Colin Harkins]
    This one is easy, but it is listed for completeness.
    You can get -i by just inserting "-" at the beginning of the expression.
e (6) = root(square(gamma(sqrt(4)/4))*sqrt(-gamma(sqrt(4))),-gamma(sqrt(4)))
    [David A. Wheeler and Colin Harkins]
    This is tricky.  Since e^(pi*i)+1=0, then root(pi*i,-1) is e.
    To create the piece parts we can use gamma(.5)=sqrt(pi) and gamma(2)=1.
sqrt(2) (0) = sqrt(4/4+4/4) [David A. Wheeler]

There are many related problems, such as selecting four digits other than
four fours, or allowing up to four digits.
Geoffrey Caveney has identified many interesting properties from
using the digits 1,2,3, and 4 exactly once each.

<!--
Geoffrey Caveney:

I am writing to share a variant of the "four fours" puzzle with you, since you have so much information about the four fours puzzle on your website. First, though, a quick observation about four fours itself: If one wants an "all gamma function" solution for 113, there is gamma(gamma(4))-gamma(4)-gamma(4/4).
Now about the variant: The "one two three four" puzzle has the same rules as four fours, except that one uses the digits 1, 2, 3, 4 once each. 
For small numbers I suppose 1,2,3,4 is probably easier than four fours. Up to 40 it can even be done with the digits strictly ordered from 1 to 4 and zero impurity according to your rules. 
With the digits in any order, I find it interesting that 1,2,3,4 can express every positive integer with zero impurity all the way until 103. Some are tricky: 89 is challenging, but I have found three ways to do it with zero impurity. 97 also, but there are at least two ways with zero impurity. 99 has the simple solution 123-4!. 101 has two nice solutions: 3^4+2/.1 and 4!/.3+21. 
Up to 153, I have zero impurity solutions for every number except 103 and 137. Curiously, it is the even numbers that become more challenging above that number: 154, 158, 164, 166, etc. Odd numbers still have zero impurity solutions from there up to at least 173. Some nice solutions above 103 include the following:
107 = 4!/.2-13
109 = (4!-1)/.2-3!
113 = 4!/.2-3!-1
135 = 3^(4-1)/.2
Curiously, I have not found the overline impurity to be particularly helpful with 103, 137, 154, 158, 164, etc. Perhaps this is because incorporating a factor of 1/9 is less of a game changer when one already has a 3 to use anyway.
So I must go directly to the gamma function impurity to solve the difficult numbers. The solutions for 103 and 137 are elegantly parallel:
103 = gamma(3!)-4^2-1
137 = gamma(3!)+4^2+1
The gamma function also handles at least the first couple difficult even numbers above 153:
154 = gamma((2+1)!)+34
(This solution avoids the additional overline impurity of 154 = gamma(3!)+4/.1~-2.)
158 = gamma(3!)+4/.1-2
166 = gamma(3!)+2*(4!-1)
For 164 I have had to resort to the % impurity:
164 = 3/2%+14
This takes care of all even numbers through 170 and all odd numbers through 173.
I would be particularly interested to know if anyone can find less "impure" solutions for 103, 137, 154, 158, and 164.
