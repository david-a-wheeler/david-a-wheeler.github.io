Often a variable can have only one of a small set of values.
An <EM>enumeration</EM> type can be created for such variables,
making it easier to understand and permitting error detection.
For example, let's say that a variable
`Today' must be one of seven values, Monday through Sunday.
Let's call the list of legal values type `Day', and set
`Today' to Tuesday as an example:
<P>
<PRE>
 type Day is (Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday);
 subtype Weekday is Day range Monday .. Friday;
 subtype Weekend is Day range Saturday .. Sunday;
 -- ... some time later
 Today : Day;
 -- ... Here's an example of setting Today to a value.
 Today := Tuesday;
</PRE>
<P>
Here's a simplified <A HREF="bnf.htm">BNF</A> for
declaring enumeration types:
<P>
<PRE>
 enumeration_type_declaration ::=
   "("  enumeration_literal_specification
      {  "," enumeration_literal_specification }  ")"
</PRE>
<P>
It happens that the Boolean type mentioned earlier is an Enumeration type
with only two values - True and False.
