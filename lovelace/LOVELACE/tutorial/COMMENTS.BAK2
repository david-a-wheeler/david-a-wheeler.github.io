Hi,
  I am working through the tutorial you have provided for Ada,
and find it very useful.
  I notice that in the Quiz of section 3.1 (Identifiers), you
have a question involving underlines.  As Netscape (browser I
am using) underlines links, it is impossible to distinguish
underlined from non-underlined.  I don't know if you were aware
of this.
Cheers,
Stephen.

Hi,
  I have finished the Lovelace course, so here is some feedback.

  Overall I fond it a very useful introduction to the language.  I
have some knowledge of other programming languages, and Lovelace
has provided useful in learning (some of) Ada.

  More specific comments:

... (various bugs)

   I have some background in OO (MODSIM II) so was able easily to
transfer my ideas from there to your Ada examples and text in section
7.  I am not sure how easily non-OO people would react to these,
but I notice in the 'to-do' that you mention this.

  Again, I found it very useful and good luck with adding further
tutorial sessions.

Cheers,
Stephen.

Subject: Lovelace Tutorial

    I just finished going through your Lovelace Ada tutorial and am
sending you comments. Ada is not needed for my job. I am taking a
programming languages course at American Univ. and our project
requires us to learn two new languages. I spread the tutorial over
three days. Two weeks ago I knew nothing about Ada, but I have been
reading a small text and lightly browsing the Ada 9X reference.

    Your tutorial is very easy, possibly too easy. I doubt that anyone
could write even a simple program with only Lovelace as his/her
background.

    I am writing a small program using the GNAT compiler from NYU and
I am having a lot of trouble understanding supplied packages. Lovelace
helped me understand what a package is and how to write my own small
package. What I am missing is an understanding of supplied packages.
As a new Ada programmer, I need to know what I/O packages every Ada
compiler should provide and how do I find what a particular compiler
is supplying. (For GNAT, I am told I should be browsing ????.ads
files.) In particular, I had trouble locating floating point I/O.

    Noone should expect to learn very much of a language from an
on-line tutorial, especially a free one. One should expect to be able
to write some simple (but more complex than "Hello World") programs to
get started.

    Please try take these comments in the best possible light. I was
very pleased to find an Ada tutorial on the WWW and I got a lot out of
it. I am just trying to gave back a little with some (hopefully)
constructive comments. In summary, my two suggestions are:

    1. Make the unit quizzes harder.

    2. Add a unit that talks about using supplied packages.

Thanks for the reply about Lovelace.

...

By the way, I think that this is a very good way to learn to
use Ada. O can not only go at my own pace, but can do it when I
feel like it. I'm now on section 7 and the last many sections have
been really good, clear explanations, good examples and the quiz to
make sure you're understanding. Well done.

Are you constantly updating it, adding new pages?

Cheers,

Lee.

Hi David!

First, many thanks for your tutorial! 

I'm new to Ada, and I've tried to learn the language the last couple of 
weeks. Your tutorial gave me a "kick" to learn more about the language. 

I've finished the seven chapters, and I'm hungry for more... :)

Well, you mentioned at the end that someone wanted to translate the tutorial
into French, I'm interested in translating it into Swedish. I see this as
a very good chance for me to learn more about Ada. I've a book written by
Jan Skansholm in swedish, I belive the book has an english counterpart too.
The title is (freely translated from swedish) "Ada from the beginning - with
the Ada 9X standard". I guess you have heard of it, or even read it...
Well, I thought of using it when translating your tutorial into swedish. 
This gives me a reason to read the book too...

Well, if you think the world is interested in my project, please email me
about it, and I'll start as soon as possible.

Yours,
	Andreas Almroth

Hello,

   I just completed your tutorial.  Very good!  :-)  I knew most of the
material up until the OO programming, but it was a nice review.

   I hope you don't mind...I told my Real-Time Systems' professor about
your tutorial.  He had to teach Ada at the beginning of the semester and
felt as though it cut into the course.  Perhaps he will have his next
class go through your tutorial instead.  :-)

   One small thing, though...since many schools might still be using
an Ada83 compiler (we are, however I convinced my system administrator
to install GNAT for my project) perhaps you could cover a little more
on those features.

   At any rate, it is fine tutorial for beginners and a good review for
an intermediate.

Take Care!

Hi,

  I've completed your Ada tutorial. I hope there was more.
  With regards to OO programming, it would be good
to show how to `call super' in methods.
  Also, it is not clear how
    procedure Foo(X : Bar'Class)
interacts with
    procedure Foo(X : Bar) 
or methods for subclasses of Bar.
  Also, you don't state the possibility of dispatching
on the type of more than one argument, like in Common Lisp. 
  Finally, how to simulate multiple inheritance in Ada.

     covering ADA.
 
     I'm not really a programmer so your notes, in comparison
     to my tutor's are proving to be more understandable.
 
     As I have just started on Ada there isn't really too
     much I can add, except that the tutorial was very useful.

Dear Mr. Wheeler,

just a few minutes ago I finished your Ada 95 tutorial. Since I already was
familiar with Ada 83 it did not offer much new to me, except of course the 
last section about object orientation. Nonetheless I enjoyed answering the
questions since I was always right :-) While doing this tutorial I always had
the impression that you created it especially for C/C++ programmers unfamiliar
with any typical features of languages from the Pascal family, what certainly
does not apply to me.

I look forward to see and run the next sections of the tutorial as soon as you
finish them.
Sincerly,

Mr. Wheeler,

In the past I have taken a couple of beginner programming courses and enjoyed
them.  My husband, a software engineer for Lockheed Martin, is now teaching
me programming at a more advanced level.  
His language of choice is Ada, and so I have been using that while studying
programming with a Pascal book: .  My husband is a good teacher, and the
authors have done a nice job of explaining themselves, but I think your
tutorial has helped me the most.  I thoroughly enjoyed your writing style.  I
also found your explanations of Object Oriented programming easier to
understand than the text I have been using.

What I appreciated most was the small, uncomplicated sample programs you
used.  So many books use examples that are three pages long and try to
incorporated three or four new ideas.

I have just completed the Ada tutorial and found it quite useful.
I am a post-grad student at George Mason University in Fairfax Virginia
who has just been introduced to Ada through a Software Construction course
which uses Ada examples.

I had to learn basic Ada in a few weeks using Koffman's book
and used your tutorial ^Learned Basic Ada..

as a review of what I just learned. So it serves up to that level quite well.
Thank you for your effort in preparing it.

NOw on to tasks...

As a relative "newbie" to the internet, it was nice to have something so
simple rather than have to download and convert etc.  It's also much
easier to understand and get a solid handle on ada than trudging
through the LRM.

Hi

I have just been directed to have a look at your Lovelace
Project ... nice work!

I am working on a similar project, but my concern is as
much with providing SE tools over the Web as with presenting
information regarding Ada. Also I am concerned with initial
software development education rather than conversion as such.

As such I think out projects are complementary rather than
needless duplication of each other.

....

regards

fintan

Thanks a lot for Lovelace.  Being probably a rather experienced Ada

better.  In fact, I've also recommended Lovelace to (potential) Ada
newbies already.

I finished LOVELACE about a week ago.  It has left a good impression on me, 
the same good impression I had when I sent the e-mail two (?) weeks ago...

I have more detailed feedback for you but I think that you should be 
aware that it comes from the perspective of a novice programmer ...

I don't know what kind of people you were aiming for in LOVELACE, but I 
think it does an outstanding job of nurturing the interest of someone 
who is truly interested in Ada 95.  I noticed that you described it as 
a whirlwind tour.  I think that is true, but it was a whirlwind tour 
with many opportunities for brief reflection and with directions for 
detailed inquiries.  Specifically, I think that the quizzes with comments 
for both the right and the wrong answers really helps a novice, like me, 
to get some sense of progress.  Of course, more can be learned by working 
through full blown exercises but I think it might break the momentum of 
someone who is curious about Ada 95 in a self-motivated way.  I also 
thought it was a good idea to include pointers to other sources of 
information about Ada.  Additionally, I did take a glance at your strawman 
list of things to-do and am particularly intrigued by your idea of 
"dynamically" building a program within the tutorial.

I do intend to nominate it for an educational Best of the Web, just as 
soon as that is possible!

I feel that I have gotten something out of LOVELACE and would like to 
contribute something in order to show my appreciation.  I looked at the 
Team Ada FAQ sheet, but I'm afraid that I'm not really in a position to do
much help.  About all that I can do is provide feedback of a simple nature.

And congratulations to you and your wife about your baby daughter.
Take care.

Subject: Lovelace Ada Tutorial 

I just completed your Lovelace Ada Tutorial.  I thought it was very well  
done.  I've had minimal exposure to Ada in the past, but expect to get
more involved now with Ada95 out and the mandate being more rigorously  
enforced.

The lessons are broken up and ordered very well.  I could do a couple
of lessons each morning before getting on to my other work.  The
sections of each lesson are small enough that even if I got interrupted  
in the middle of a lesson it was only a short distance back to recover  
at a logical break.

I especially liked the end-of-section quizzes.  They tended to ensure
that I absorbed what I'd read and hadn't just scanned it without  
engaging my brain (something that's easy to do when reading long  
technical documents).  Even the sections with simple questions kept me  
awake, so here's an area for improvement:  Add a Quiz to the sections  
that don't have them, even if it's just a regurgitation of what was  
presented a couple of paragraphs above.

The only chance for improvement was that there were a few typos, these  
seemed to be more prevalent in the last few lessons -- in particular  
there are some missing or extra articles or connecting words.  I think
"prefin" is used someplace that should be "predefin".  None of the typos  
obscured the meaning of the text.

The hypertext links are also a good inclusion, I only followed a few but  
may come back for some more in the future.

I have recommended this tutorial to my colleagues.  Thanks for offering  
this resource.

Hi David!

     I just completed your Lovelace Ada Tutorial.  I took it for two reasons:

       1) I am using Ada again, and haven't used it for a couple years
       2) Though I did/do know Ada, I don't yet know Ada 95.  (While we are
          using Ada 83, I want to try to assure I don't use identifiers or
          similarly cause a transition problem when moving to Ada 95.)

     I think it's a very good job!  Keep up the great work!

Ok, here's the request you made.

I actually liked the tutorial, it gave me a lot of information.  I hope that
you continue to develop it, maybe even having the tutorial develop a semi-real
application so that concepts could be more easily absorbed.

Also, consider adding sections like "Ada for C programmers" and "Ada for Pascal
Programmers", too.

Thanks again.

Excellent tutorial.  I've been studying Ada for 6 months and never grasped much
in the lectures.  I'm was in a right panic about the end of year exam and the
assignments I have to complete before the end of the year.  This tutorial
explained every-thing really clearly.  I feel confident that I can finish the
Ada paper I am studying and perhaps pass.

David,

    I just completed your nice Ada tutorial and found it very useful as
    a quick 'crash course' of the language. IMHO it is a brilliant idea
    to include more general sections like those on programming safety
    and efficiency.

    The only problem I encountered was that GNAT (at least 2.06 for
    OS/2) doesn't always raise Constraint_Error exceptions when it
    should. This is of course not your fault, but I think it would be a
    good idea to warn GNAT users that they might experience some
    difference between theory and practice - as long as GNAT is a work
    in progress.

Dear Mr. Wheeler:


	I'm using your Lovelace for courses I taught here using GNAT
Ada 95. Students were giving hardcopies I prepared for them for these
who do not find it convenient to browse on the Web using slow machines 
in our PC lab.

...


        Your work in Lovelace is a great time-safer for my teaching here 
since good text on Ada 95 is still not readily available in book format. 
Navigating with Lovelace in mind also add much meaning to the Web surfing 
to many of our students here.

	Thanks for your work.

Mr. Wheeler,
I would like to thank you for putting together such a fine Ada tutorial
(Lovelace).  I am currently a graduate student at George Mason University
working on an M.S. in Info Systems and a graduate certificate in Software
Systems Engineering, something I believe you know a bit about.  SWSE 619 is
what has prompted me to learn Ada and your tutorial is making it quite
enjoyable.

I do have one question for you.  Do you know of any Internet newsgroups or
forums where someone such as myself might be able to post questions about
Ada?  Specifically, I'm trying to find out if there is an Ada equivalent to
C's getche() function for accepting character by character input without a
carriage return.  If you know of any newsgroups, or happen to know the
answer to the question itself, I would very much appreciate a quick email
from you.  I can be reached at <crowley@cybercash.com>.

Thank you again for your tutorial and your help!

Chris Crowley

[The newsgroup is comp.lang.ada, and yes, Ada 95 includes
 a function Get_Immediate to do exactly that.]

Dave:

I've been browsing for a good Ada tutorial. Looked at your page. I think 
I'll be using it as a tutorial. I've got gnat installed under Linux on my 
486DX2/66. Mostly, I program using C, and C++. I think Ada is worth 
investigating for me (a consulting programmer).

Going through your on-line resume, I see you're quite well versed in many 
disciplines. Then I noticed on your web page you wrote:

>Most important to me, I'm a Christian.

This was refreshing to see. God rewards and guides those who put Him 
first. He has blessed me also with a great job and a sound mind. I've got 
to finish getting ready for church, this morning.

God bless,

Jon Berndt

David,

Appreciate your considerable efforts in developing the 
Lovelace tutorial.  Could you possibly provide the 
MS-DOS ftp-able version in self-unzipping format?
(I don't have the correct PKUNZIP version).  Again,
thanks for the hard work.  Take care.

[ You can get a more current "unzipping" program from  
  ftp://ftp.uu.net/pub/archiving/zip 
 as explained in the "downloading Lovelace" page. 
 
 I'd be happy to provide a self-unzipping file, but the only program 
 I know of that does that is "pkzip", which is shareware ($). 
 Since I get absolutely NO money from distributing Lovelace, I can't 
 really justify buying pkzip just for that purpose.  Also, it would be
 a pain to distribute, since I'd have to download to a PC, zip, and then
 upload. 
  
 If you could find a free way for me to create self-extracting "zip" files 
 from a Sun Sparc, I'd be pleased to do it.

Very nice tutorial.  I am taking a graduate-preparatory 
course at NYU, and we are using Ada.  Here's a suggestion:

When introducing a new statement or syntax, start with some 
simple examples.  Don't ever jump right into the BNF 
diagram.  It's easier to understand a given BNF if you've 
already gotten a feel for the construct that it 
illustrates.

Slow down.  Obviously, this is just a function of how much 
time you and others have had to flesh this thing out.  
Lovelace is an excellent introduction to the main ideas and 
capabilities of Ada95, but it doesn't yet serve as an 
adequate textbook.  This may not have been what you 
originally had in mind for Lovelace, but why not?  It 
doesn't have to be done all at once.

Good luck and thanks for the knowledge!

-Samuel Fredland, NYC


[I went through Lovelace and put examples before every BNF, and
gave him a draft version to see what he thought of the changes.

As far as "slowing down" goes, it's hard to please everyone; I don't talk
about if-then-else and loops until lesson 3, and you have to get through
lesson 9 before you can even do trivial I/O!  I'm trying to strike a
balance between too slow and too fast; please let me know if there are
specific changes you'd recommend. ]

Just completed section 4.2 of rev. 4.5 of Lovelace.  The question is a 
little tricky because if A is the name of a type that is visible in the 
scope of the declaration

procedure Delete_File( Integer : A );

then it IS a legal declaration.  "INTEGER" is a predefined type, not a 
keyword.


[My reply was: if you understand Ada that well, you probably don't need
a tutorial!  However, I'll try to add a note about that subtlety somewhere]

Hi. Forgive the previous bad message..if any.

        I am new to Ada 95 (but not to Ada 83) and to gnatlist@seas.gwu.ede.
 I downloaded your Small programming demo  about 3 weeks ago and find it
 quite helpful for my first fling at learning Ada9X. I will give you a brief
 report re my experience with Small as one more data point for you.
 ...

 I am a retired mechanical engineer just in this for the fun of it.

        3) Small would be much easier for a newby to get up to speed on if
 it included a small sample play session. It is pretty grim tying to figure
 out who does what when without a game plan. Maybe there was an earlier one
 which I missed as a late comer?

a taped 4 day crash course on Ada that was difficult to sit through.  I

Dear Mr. Wheeler,
     Thank you for posting the announcement of Lovelace 5.0 in comp.lang.ada.
I presently access the Internet through America Online, which costs five
cents a minute.  So I prefer to run your excellent tutorial off line.
     I have an off line .HTML browser, and in the past have run a copy of
Lovelace found on an Ada CD-ROM  -  I believe the one from Walnut
Creek.  Is there any way I can download the entire new version of
Lovelace?  (If not, I'll wait until Lovelace 5.0 appears on a CD-ROM,
or until I decide I can afford a flat-rate Internet Service Provider!)

     Thanks for your time, and I hope you have a blessed and happy
Christmas and New Year.

  many people are missing this.  I've bolded the "download Lovelace" on the

Ada is not an option here. :(

Good explanation. And an excellent place to introduce graphics.
However, if you are interested, I would like to suggest an alternative
graphic based closely on what you started with. I can give it to you
in PICT, GIF, or almost any other format.

Let me know.

I liked it before and I like it now. I'm going to be talking with
Chuch Engle next week about some Ada promotion ideas. I'm going
to mention your tutorial and how it might be integrated with other
on-line resources.

Yes, I liked Lovelace. Before reading it, I tried to read the Ada
Rationale, and I found it very difficult to understand.
Now perhaps it will be easier to do.

you're probably going to think i am a real pain in the butt.  i found

in one of the lovelace tutorial web pages.

in http://www.adahome.com/Tutorials/Lovelace/s15-f.htm it says

'To declare a private package, just append the word "private":'

i think you meant 'prepend'.

considering that this is the first error that i noticed in 15 sections,
i'd say that's pretty
good.  in fact, i like layout and language of the tutorial very much.

Dear Mr. Wheeler,

I am teaching a software engineering course at the College
of William & Mary in Virginia, and I decided to use Ada (95)
and gnat as the basis for the semester-long software project
the students have to do as teams. I would like them to use
your tutorial, but it is esentially unusable -- it takes to
long to load pages from Switzerland. (I am using the
lglwww.edfl.ch site.) I would like to know if there is a
closer (faster) site, or even if I could download the tutorial
so that it would be local.

I found this speedy and tidy, with allowances for my ignorance of American
terminology. I drove through it in about 4 hours, attacking the quiz questions
and then, in the event of failure, tracking down the reason for my
mis-understanding.

I do not, however, understand 'program'. I understand sub-program, package,
task unit and generic unit - but do not see how to make a program. You discuss
the procedure Small, but I do not see the program which contains it. At this
point I wished for an index to Lovelace, to find where I had missed the
definition of a 'program', to find the first mention of the concept.

[I'll try to make this clearer in future versions]

I also found some of the html links had come adrift. I could not access the
document on style.

[I'll try to fix such links! Thanks!]

I just wanted to say that I like the Ada tutorial you've written..
I'm a beginning CS major (with two years under my belt)
and I am really interested in Ada, especially since ada95
and GNAT have come of age.

Are there interfaces in Ada for graphical programming, such as
X-Windows?  I suppose it wouldn't be too hard to encapsulate all the
C functions into Ada packages...

...

anyway, I'm rambling;  The tutorial is great!

I an a S/W Engineer for a defense contractor in Huntsville, Alabama. I 
have been coding in Ada for 5 years. I am proficient in the standard 
programming features of Ada83 and found your tutorial to be very 
helpful in learning the major changes in Ada95 as well as the tasking

more of a need for interfaces to C and fortran, so maybe more time can 
be spent on pragma's and some examples of this concept.

David,

   While the tutorial, at least as far as I've been through, is quite useful,
the answer to the quiz in section 10.2 is incorrect.  You ask which statement
defines an exception called No_Safety_Net, when actually the statement defines
an exception called Safety_Net.  I normally don't point out errors, but that
one might leave some users with an erroneous expectation about how to name
and reference exceptions.

    Thanks for the tutorial,
         Marty Pinaud

David,

First of all, I want to tell you great I think your ADA tutorial is.  I
have found it to be very useful in getting an idea of what ADA is all
about.

My interest in ADA is due to the fact that I will be taking a computer
science class this fall that is taught with ADA.  Previously, it was
taught with Pascal.  I was concerned that I would have to work in the
lab all of the time because I wouldn't be able to get my hands on an
ADA compiler at a reasonable price.  Well, I found one for free (GNAT)
- you can't get more reasonable than that.  So, I will be able to work
on my projects on my PC here at home.

Thanks,
Rich Maggio

David, 

I just completed the Lovelace Ada tutorial and per your
request, I wanted to drop you a note letting you know that I'd
done so.  I'm very familiar with Ada83, so I was mainly
concerned with learning what's new with Ada95.  While the
tutorial, of course, covered a lot that I already knew, I
found it's links to the appropriate on-line style guides and
manuals quite helpful.   

I'm cc:-ing this e-mail to the Best-of-Web folks to put in my
vote for your site:
(http://snowhite.cis.temple.edu:8030/lovelace/lovelace.html)


				Thanks,

				John McDonald

David,

The presentation improvements are very nice.  It does add a
degree of attractiveness, and since both browsers and networks are
getting (slightly) better and faster, it was a good time to do that.

As I get into this I doubt it will ever get finished but it is interesting
and forcing me to learn more about Ada.  After I get a significant chunk
written in Ada and feel I am somewhat competant at OO I will have a look
at C++ or some other OOL to write another section.

Thanks for the note, David.

I'll update the PAL as well.  Unfortunately, the next Ada CDROM just entered
production with version 5.3 of Lovelace, but 5.5 will make the CDROM that
targets Tri-Ada 96.

You've done an excellent job with Lovelace, including the updates covering
Java.  Keep up the good work.

I want to thank the people who graciously offered me advice and
encouragement (most via email) (hamlink, deininger, nortonb, jrogers, dcw
and of course Wheeler)

and to thank David for writing this tutorial.  IMHO it does a good job
of introducing the basics of Ada and OO programing.

David,

On page 12.4 of the Lovelace tutorial
(http://www.adahome.com/Tutorials/Lovelace/s12-4.htm),
you have the following fragment:

----

  type Tree_Node; -- Incomplete type declaration.
  type Tree_Access is access Tree_Node;
  type Tree_Node is
    record
      Parent      : Tree_Access;
      Left, Right : Tree_Access;
      Data        : Unbounded_String;
    end record;

Here's an example of statements using this tree data structure, if A and
B are of type Tree_Access: 

  A := new List_Node;
  B := new List_Node;
  A.Data := To_Unbounded_String("Hello!");   -- assign some data
  B.Data := To_Unbounded_String("Goodbye!");
  A.Left := B;                               -- connect them.
  B.Parent := A;

----

Note the incorrect statements

  A := new List_Node;
  B := new List_Node;

which should be

  A := new Tree_Node;
  B := new Tree_Node;

Hi David,

I'm in Lovelace section 11.1 and something isn't 
completely clear (first time this has happened thus 
far so I'd say you've done a great job with the 
tutorial!).  Do I understand correctly that you can 
instantiate all three types using the same name 
"Swap."  I'm assuming this is the polymorphic 
behavior of Ada that lets the run-time system 
decide which instance of Swap to invoke based on 
the type of the passed arguments, but isn't wasn't 
explicitly stated that way in the tutorial.

Thanks,
Matt

Hi David,

I completed Lovelace today.  I spent probably 4-5 
hours on it over several sessions.  I found it very 
informative and easy to follow.  Good job!

I really have few criticisms.  The continual 
compare and contrast with C and C++ was great. 
Although, since the last language I was really 
proficient with was VAX Fortran, it was of less 
help to me than to those proficient in C or C++.

Regards,
Matt Whiting

Mr Wheeler,

Now that I've completed your Lovelace tutorial, I am obediently
responding to your call for e-mail.  I found the Lovelace tutorial
quite enjoyable.  The tiny sections were very conducive to reading.
I will attempt to helpfully give you constructive criticism.

The quiz questions were a good idea, and I am confident that they
helped. You could easily get away with having two or even three
questions, possibly more involved than what is there currently.  More
important, however, is fleshing out explanations of answers
thoroughly.  (Occassionally I found it irritating to be told simply,
``Correct,'' when I wanted to be sure whether I was right about what
made the answer correct.)

Another possible change would be to recommend skipping sections
occassionally.  A student might be interested in only of the existence
and applications of some features (tasks, Java applets, and
other-language compatibility come to mind), deferring the details to
later when the occassion to use it actually arises. I found the Java
sections particularly tedious, at least until some day I find I want to
develop Java applets.

Really, however, the tutorial is a marvelous thing and am now anxious
to find something to create using Ada. Thank you for making this
available!

David,

I am really enjoying the Lovelace tutorial.  In going through it I have
noticed one small typo.  The word between the ***s appears to be
missing.

In section 6.7:

"we've discussed so far. If you happen to base it on type Integer, your
customers can still add, subtract, and so on. Even
if you really only ***want*** customers to use "less than" as an
"ordering" concept, the customers may not realize what limitations
you had in mind and use all sorts of other operations. If you"

Dear Mr. Wheeler:

In the bibliography of the 2nd edition of my book "Object-Oriented Software
Construction" I would like to list the reference to your Ada 95 tutorial
which I found at

	 http://lglsun.epfl.ch/Ada/Tutorials/Lovelace/dwheeler.htm

A few questions: 

	- Is this the right URL? (Or is it
	  a mirror site, and if so what is the better address to give?)

	- Do you expect the URL to remain valid for several years (the
	  hoped shelf life of my book)?

I will be grateful for answers on these two points.


Thanks for contributing this resource and best regards,

Your ADA tutorial is simply outstanding.  It gives a direct insight to
the fundamentals and extends the concepts in a very useful easy to
understand manner.  

I graduated with a BSEE from UCF in the spring of '89.  I never had an
ADA class.  I have used FORTRAN in the past. Just recently I started a
new job where ADA is used for aircraft operational flight programs and
controls and displays programs. My first successful OFP software build
was completed a couple of weeks ago.  

After about two weeks of the tutorial I wrote my first stand alone
program to convert polar coordinates to rectangular coordinates using
VAX ADA.  This gave me the confidence to persue the OFP.  

Your tutorial goes above and beyond what I need to know to do the OFP
and CDP but that is fine with me.

I would have liked to have seen a little more on pragmas.  
I understand this is a powerful feature with very broad implications.
Other than that it was perfect.

Thank you very much,

Greg Johnston
AC-130U software engineer.
