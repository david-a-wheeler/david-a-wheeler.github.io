Program units (including subprograms and packages)
normally consist of two parts:
<UL>
<LI>
The <EM>declaration</EM>, which contains information that will
be visible to other program units. The declaration defines the interface
for a program unit.
Sometimes people refer to a declaration as a <EM>specification</EM>.
They are somewhat analogous to the contents of C ``.h'' files.
<LI>
The <EM>body</EM>, which contains implementation details that need not
be visible to other parts.
They are somewhat analogous to the contents of C ``.c'' files.
</UL>
<P>
These separate parts of program units are usually stored in separate files.
This explicit distinction between declaration and body allows a program
to be designed, written, and tested as a set of largely independent
software components.
<P>
There are two special cases to help make programming easier:
<OL>
<LI>
Separate declarations are not <EM>required</EM> for subprograms
(procedures and functions). If a subprogram has a body but no declaration,
the body of a subprogram can serve as its own declaration.
This makes writing the `hello, world' program in lesson 1 easier -
technically, that simple program is a procedure body that
automatically gives its own declaration.
<LI>
For some packages, it's not possible to have implementation details.
For example, a package declaration could be just
a collection of constants (like pi and the square root of 2).
In this case, the package must not have a body, since one isn't needed.
This is relatively rare - most packages need
both a declaration and a body.
