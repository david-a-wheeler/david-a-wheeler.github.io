Here are some miscellaneous capabilities of Text_IO that you may find useful.
<P>
Text_IO defines functions Current_Input, Current_Output, and Current_Error;
each returns a File_Type.
Current_Error is like Current_Output but should be used for
error messages.
Here's an example of printing an error message:
<PRE>
  Put(Current_Error, "Error - the widget file is missing.");
</PRE>
<P>
Procedures Set_Input, Set_Output, and Set_Error let you set the
current input, output, and error files somewhere else.
For example, if you want all error messages to go to file "error", do
the following:
<PRE>
  Error_File : File_Type;
  -- ...
  Create(Error_File, Out_File, "error");
  Set_Error(Error_File);
</PRE>
<P>
Ada and the underlying operating system
may delay sending output to the user to increase overall performance.
This is called buffering.
Usually buffering is a good idea,
but sometimes you want the output to be displayed right away.
In that case, use the <EM>Flush</EM> operation to immediately display
everything sent to a given file (the default is Current_Output).
<P>
Sometimes you want to check the keyboard to see if a user has pressed
a key, and if so, what that key was.
The Ada 95 procedure to do that is called <EM>Get_Immediate</EM>.
There are a few caveats with Get_Immediate:
<UL>
<LI>
On some systems it's not possible to implement Get_Immediate;
in that case Ada can't do it (obviously).
<LI>
On multiprocessing systems it's often not a good idea to continuously
check if something has happened.
This is called polling, and polling can slow the whole system down.
If you plan to just wait if a key hasn't been pressed, use <EM>Get</EM>
instead.
