<H1>Notes Regarding the Use of Ada 83</H1>
<P>
The Lovelace tutorial is written specifically for Ada 95 users.
If you're using an older, Ada 83-only compiler, here are some tips:
<P>
<OL>
<LI>
Replace all uses of "Ada.Text_IO" with just "Text_IO".
<LI>
Ada 83 doesn't have
the package "Ada.Integer_Text_IO" predefined.
Instead, substitute the package name "Ada_Integer_Text_IO" instead
and compile the following:
<PRE>
with Text_IO;
package Ada_Integer_Text_IO is new Text_IO.Integer_IO(Integer);
</PRE>
<LI>
You won't be able to use capabilities new to Ada 95, of course.
These include object-oriented (OO) programming (inheritance and tagged types),
protected types, child packages, or Unbounded_String.
Most of the lessons in this tutorial <EM>do</EM> apply, and you can still
learn much with an Ada 83 compiler.
