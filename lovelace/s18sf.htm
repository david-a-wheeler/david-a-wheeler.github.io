I haven't explained every detail of <A HREF="small.htm">program Small</A>,
but hopefully by now you've got a flavor of it.
<P>

There are lots of ways to extend this program; it's a small world, after all.
You could add lots of specialized types of Item (door, key, weapon, etc.).
You could add multi-playerness (this would involve finding a way to get
data from multiple players,
say a binding to BSD-style sockets, and switching from Text_IO
to an IO routine that would use the interface).
You could permit dynamic creation and modification of the world at run-time
(add a "wizard" command, and then add wizard-only commands like
@create object, @destroy object, @view object, and @set object attribute=value).
I haven't implemented independently active monsters, or a combat system, or
magic; you might want one or more of them.
Perhaps you could permit scripts to be executed at run-time.
<P>

The best way to understand Small is probably to look at it.
There are several ways you can look at it:
<UL>
<LI><A HREF="small.htm">You can look at the source code for
program Small as a set of hypertext documents</A>;
you can easily wander about the whole program in a little time, stopping
and examining whatever parts interest you.
<LI>You can view the
<A HREF="small.txt">source code as a single large ASCII file</A>.
<LI>You can download the
<A HREF="small.zip">source files as a "zip" file</A>.
</UL>
<P>
You are strongly encouraged to wander about and look at
<A HREF="small.htm">the hypertext source code for Small</A>, but
you do not have to.
The Lovelace home page has a link to Small if you choose to look
at it later.
<P>
