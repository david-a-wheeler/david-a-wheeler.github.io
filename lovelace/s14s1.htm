There are a few key Ada-related documents that you should know about:
<UL>
<LI>The most important document is the
Ada 95 <EM>Reference Manual (RM)</EM>,
which has been referred to throughout this tutorial.
The Ada 95 RM is like a legal contract between a user of the Ada language and
an Ada compiler developer; it defines the rights and responsibilities
of each party.
The previous version of this manual was titled the <EM>Language Reference Manual</EM> (LRM), and some people still use the term "LRM" to refer to the RM.
<LI><EM>Ada Quality and Style: Guidelines for Professional Programmers</EM>
(AQ&amp;S)
provides a set of specific guidelines to help developers produce better
Ada programs.
Basically it's the distilled experience of other Ada users;
most Ada developers use it.
The AQ&amp;S was
developed by the Software Productivity Consortium (SPC).
<LI>The <EM>Ada Rationale</EM> is a document that
explains why Ada is designed the way it is.
The rationale includes a number of examples showing how to use the
various features of Ada, in particular the features new to Ada 95.
<LI>The <EM>Annotated Ada Reference Manual (AARM)</EM>
is an extended version of the RM.
The AARM is simply the RM with a large number of additional notes
in each section on the ramifications and implications of every part.
The AARM is used mostly by compiler vendors.
