<H1>Professional History of David A. Wheeler</H1>
<P>
Here's some information on things I've done,
divided by categories I've devised.
I hope you find it interesting!
The first two categories are
<A HREF="#leadership">Leadership</A> and
<A HREF="#communication">Communication</A>.
The next categories are:
<UL>
<LI><A HREF="#project_evaluations">Project Evaluations</A>
<LI><A HREF="#SET">Software Engineering Technologies (CASE, SEE, Inspections)</A>
<LI><A HREF="#internet">Internet and WWW Technologies</A>
<LI><A HREF="#programming">Programming</A>
</UL>
 
<P>
<B><A NAME="leadership">Leadership</A></B>
<UL>
<LI>Led over 20 people in the Joint Composite Tracking Network (JCTN)
Technical Special Studies subpanel to develop software standards and
gateway backup/failover requirements for the proposed JCTN.
<LI>Led five-person team to develop RDD-to-SADMT (RTS),
a program that generated executable simulations of
Ballistic Missile Defense systems from a
Computer-Aided Software Engineering (CASE) tool (RDD-100).
This essentially turned a CASE tool into a visual programming language
for a specialized type of distributed simulation.
<LI>Led three-person team to evaluate a
Software Engineering Environment (SEE) and a SEE
evaluation method.
<LI>Led two-person team to develop hypertext version of
a system information architecture.
<LI>Ran own consulting business.
</UL>

<B><A NAME="communication">Communication</A></B>
<UL>
<LI>Co-authored
<A HREF="http://www.computer.org/cspress/catalog/bp07340.htm"><I>Software
Inspection: An Industry Best Practice</I></A>
through the IEEE Computer Society Press
(ISBN 0-8186-7340-0, IEEE Catalog Number BP07340).
You can order this book from the IEEE by emailing to
<A HREF="mailto:cs.books@computer.org">cs.books@computer.org</A>.
<LI>Authored <A HREF="book.htm">Ada 95: The Lovelace Tutorial</A>.
<LI>Co-Authored the <A HREF="http://www.gnome.org">GNOME User's Guide</A>.
<LI>Wrote numerous papers; see
<A HREF="papers.htm">my list of publications</A>.
<LI>Presented an enormous number of briefings in a variety of settings.
</UL>
 
<P>
<B><A NAME="project_evaluations">Project Evaluations</A></B>
<UL>
<LI>Evaluated the Linux operating system against the Common Criteria,
including the development of a vulnerability analysis of it.
<LI>Led development of the "Software Challenges" report, a report
describing the challenges of software development in the
Ballistic Missile Defense Organization (BMDO) and how to overcome them.
This report has been given to Gen. Davis, Gen. Lyles (as director of BMDO),
and Dr. Hans Mark (head of DDR&amp;E).
<LI>Performed a number of Software Capability Evaluations (SCEs),
comparing software development processes of organizations with the
Software Engineering Institute's (SEI's)
Capability Maturity Model (CMM).
Most of these evaluations were part of a source selection.
<LI>Evaluated large projects (including the BSY-2,
JSTARS, PATRIOT, and THAAD) to determine their status
in various ways and forums.
<LI>Performed detailed software safety analysis of systems
using software fault tree analysis (SFTA) and made recommendations
based on these analyses.
<LI>Participated in the development of a software project
risk analysis method.
<LI>Developed a specialized communication analysis approach
and applied it to identify communications problems in a specific
project.
</UL>
 
<P>
<B><A NAME="SET">Software Engineering Technologies</A></B>
<UL>
<LI>Researched and wrote on software inspections, culminating
in book published by the IEEE.
<LI>Evaluated a large number of CASE tools, including
ObjecTime, IDE's Software through Pictures, Cadre Teamwork,
RDD-100, and DCDS.
Some of these evaluations are included in two of my papers.
<LI>Evaluated a number of SEEs and their technological bases.
<LI>Evaluated a number of special areas on request from
sponsors, including software safety,
DCE, CORBA, the Global Command and Control
System (GCCS), the Defense Information Infrastructure (DII)
Common Operating Environment (COE), TCP/IP and JTIDS,
information standards,
lessons learned from prototyping, Ada, metrics, reuse, and POSIX.
<LI>Have taught classes on Unix internals, CASE methodologies,
and other technical areas.
</UL>
 
<P>
<B><A NAME="internet">Internet and WWW Technologies</A></B>
<UL>
<LI>Webmaster and system manager of the NATO CCMS
<A HREF="http://echs.ida.org/">Environmental Clearinghouse System (ECHS)</A>.
<LI>Led development of a hypertext version of the
BMDO National Missile Defense (NMD) Information Architecture,
showing how to apply hypertext and the World Wide Web to
system development documents.
This included documentation on a process for developing "tightly woven"
information; see my paper on the subject (IDA Paper P-3166).
<LI>Developed a large interactive hypertext document, <I>Lovelace</I>,
a tutorial on the Ada programming language.
Lovelace was developed using a self-developed tutorial generator
and supports interactive quizzes, code compilation over the WWW,
and Java applets (written in Ada).
<LI>Conversant with Internet and WWW technologies, including HTML,
HTTP, Java, CGI, and TCP/IP.
</UL>
 
<P>
<B><A NAME="programming">Programming</A></B>
<UL>
<LI>Know a large number of computer programming languages, including:
Java, Ada, C++, C, Pascal, Perl, Python, Smalltalk,
Fortran, PL/I, BASIC (various versions), LISP, FORTH, sh, awk,
and various assembly languages.
<LI>Developed RTS and STS, programs that extracted information in
CASE tools and then generated executable simulations of Ballistic
Missile Defense systems.
<LI>Developed
<A HREF="http://www.adahome.com/Resources/Tools/ada2html/ada2html.htm">ada2html</A>,
a program that generates a hyperlinked
view of Ada source code.
This program has been used to develop documentation
by at least one commercial company
(<A HREF="http://www.inmet.com/javadir/download/api/index.htm">Intermetrics'
documentation on the Ada interface to the Java library</A>).
<LI>Part of team that developed a relational database system, Corot.
<LI>Developed on-line purchasing and customer database search systems.
<LI>Maintained in C a commercial multi-player role playing game
(Scepter of Goth) and various other multi-player systems.
<LI>Developed a number of smaller programs, such as the WWW tutorial
generator used in Lovelace and the various programs to create hypertext
links in the BMDO NMD Information Architecture.
<LI>Have also developed a compiler, sophisticated assembly-language
debugger, inventory control system, and six arcade games in assembly language.
