Some programs might be very wordy if you had to always specify
where a procedure is defined in order to use it.
Thus, Ada provides the <EM>use clause</EM>.
Whenever you use a procedure (or something else) but do not specify
where it is defined, the Ada compiler will search all units
listed in applicable <EM>use clause</EM>s.
Use clauses follow the <EM>with clause</EM>,
begin with the keyword <EM>use</EM>,
and then list the library units to be searched.
Here's how that first program would look with a <EM>use clause</EM>:

<!-- Form to permit compilation using WebAda removed. -->
<P>
<PRE>
-- Print a simple message to demonstrate a trivial Ada program.
with Ada.Text_IO;
use Ada.Text_IO;  -- use clause - automatically search Ada.Text_IO.
procedure Hello2 is
begin
 Put_Line("Hello, world!"); -- Note: No longer has "Ada.Text_IO" in front.
end Hello2;
</PRE>

If, in this new version of the program, you changed the second-to-last-line
back to:
<BR>
Ada.Text_IO.Put_Line("Hello, world!");
<BR>
would the program still work?
