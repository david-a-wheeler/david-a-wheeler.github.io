Ada has types, packages, and lots of other things; how do you use
them all together?
What I suggest is that, barring other information, you use a
standard format for defining object-oriented types in Ada.
<P>
Here's a "standard format" that I use for an OO Ada type definition,
which you can
vary to meet your needs (capitalized italics are what you supply):
<P>
<PRE>
  with <I>PACKAGE_NAME_OF_PARENT</I>;
  use  <I>PACKAGE_NAME_OF_PARENT</I>;
  package <I>PACKAGE_NAME</I> is
    type <I>MY_TYPE</I> is tagged private; -- or, new Parent_Type with private
    type <I>MY_TYPE</I>_Access is access all <I>MY_TYPE</I>'Access;
        -- We'll talk about this in a later lesson; by adding this declaration
        -- here you'll make certain operations easier to do later.
    -- Dispatching operations go here.
  private
    -- Define the details of MY_TYPE here.
  end <I>PACKAGE_NAME</I>;
</PRE>
<P>
For the package name, I generally use the plural of the type name.
Here's an example:
<P>
<PRE>
  with Creatures;
  use  Creatures;

  package Players is
    type Player is new Creature with private; -- Player is a type of Creature
    type Player_Access is access all Player'Access;
    -- Dispatching operations go here.
    procedure Look(P : in Player);
  private
    type Player is new Creature with
     record
       Logged_In : Boolean;
     end record;
  end Players;
</PRE>
<P>
Ada permits multiple OO types to be defined in a package, but that
doesn't mean you <EM>must</EM> do so.
As a general rule, put different type definitions in different
packages unless the two types are strongly interrelated.
