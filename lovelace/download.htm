<H1>Information on How to Download Lovelace</H1>
<!-- $Id: download.html,v 1.5 1995/09/22 21:38:21 wheeler Exp wheeler $ -->
Lovelace can be downloaded and used `locally' (i.e. without an
Internet connection).
There are several steps involved in getting Lovelace installed.
If you're looking for ease-of-use, I have a simple recommendation:
<A HREF="book.htm"><FONT SIZE=+1><B>buy the book instead</B></FONT></A>.
<P>
The local version of Lovelace has some innate limitations:
<OL>
<LI>
Lovelace will occasionally refer you to other resources
outside this tutorial.
Attempting to follow such references will fail
unless you have a working connection to the Internet.
<LI>
Although I've tried to make it reasonable, there are still several
steps involved in getting Lovelace up-and-running locally.
People read screens more slowly than paper, there's more eyestrain,
and you're still tethered to a computer.  Given the amount of
material involved in Lovelace,
it's easier to <A HREF="book.htm">buy the book</A>.
</OL>
<P>
I recommend using Lovelace through the WWW instead of using
a local version unless your WWW connection is nonexistent,
slow, or expensive.
Even if you use the local version of Lovelace, I'd like to
hear from you when you finish it - please find a way to email me
(at <A HREF="mailto:dwheeler&#64;dwheeler.com">dwheeler&#64;dwheeler.com</A>)
when you complete the course and let me know how you like it.
<P>
<B>DO NOT</B> make a local copy of Lovelace available
to the web unless you're willing to update your copy within a
month after the master copy has been updated.
There are already several sites providing updated versions of Lovelace;
the web does not need obsolete sites to confuse people.
<P>
If, after all this, you decide to install a local version,
I suggest that you use the form below to
receive <B>automated email notifications of changes</B> to Lovelace.

The text below describes how to download the files you'll need.
Basically you'll need to download and install (1) the Lovelace data files
and (2) a web browser.  Some of you may already have a web browser,
you can skip the latter step.
After downloading the files you need, then read and apply the
<A HREF="install.txt">installation instructions</A>.
Don't worry about how long they both are; they're long because I'm trying
to cover many different computer systems.
<P>
If you've decided that you want to download a local version of Lovelace,
let me first take care of a common case: PCs running Windows.
<P>
If you're an IBM-PC user, you use Microsoft Windows (3.1, 95, NT, or
better), and you don't have a "Web Browser", I've developed a special
version of Lovelace that you might like.
A "web browser" is a program you need to use Lovelace
(Web browsers include the following programs:
Netscape, Internet Explorer, Mosaic, Cello, and Lynx).
For those of you who don't have a browser, I've developed a version of
Lovelace that's been pre-integrated with Cello (a web browser).
Cello isn't the best web browser, but it's free and easy to install.
If you plan to use a web browser for other things I'd suggest you install
a better browser than Cello, but if you're only going to view Lovelace
then this will get you going a little faster (though not as nicely).
You can
<A HREF="ftp://ftp.adahome.com/pub/HTML/lovecell.zip">download
the Lovelace/Cello combination directly</A>.
You'll then need to "unzip" this file, as I explain below and in the
installation instructions.
<P>

For everyone else choosing to download a local version of Lovelace,
select the compression format and source from the
options below, and save the
file using your web browser's ``Save File'' command after downloading.
Local versions of Lovelace are available in:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>
``tar+gzip'' format, a format especially easy for
Unix and Apple Macintosh platforms.
This file is available via
<A HREF="lovelace.tar.gz">this http server</A>
or
<A HREF="ftp://ftp.adahome.com/pub/HTML/lovelace.tar.gz">ftp</A>.
<LI>
``zip'' format, a format especially easy
for IBM PC-compatible platforms running MS-DOS, Microsoft Windows, or OS/2.
This file is available via
<A HREF="lovelace.zip">this http server</A>
or
<A HREF="ftp://ftp.adahome.com/pub/HTML/lovelace.zip">ftp</A>.
</UL>
<P>
If you download the `zip' format but don't have
an `unzip' program, you can download an `unzip' program from the 
Info-ZIP archives,
which has software to unzip files as well as create zip files
(including both a free implementation and the shareware pkzip/pkunzip programs).
The Info-ZIP archives can be easily accessed via
<A HREF="http://quest.jpl.nasa.gov/Info-ZIP/">JPL's version of the
Info-ZIP archives</A>.
The archives are also available (in a less-easily-used form) at
<A HREF="ftp://ftp.uu.net/pub/archiving/zip/">UUNET</A> and
<A HREF="ftp://wuarchive.wustl.edu/packages/compression/">WUARCHIVE</A>.
<P>
Other sources for Lovelace files include the
<A HREF="http://wuarchive.wustl.edu/languages/ada/userdocs/html/cardcat/lovelace.html">Public Ada Library (PAL) copy of Lovelace</A>
and the
<A HREF="ftp://ftp.gwu.edu/pub/ada/ez2load/">ez2load version of Lovelace</A>
(you can read the
<A HREF="ftp://ftp.gwu.edu/pub/ada/ez2load/README">ez2load README file</A>
for more about ez2load).
<P>
You can also get a local version of Lovelace by CD-ROM.
One CD-ROM with Lovelace on it is the "Walnut Creek Ada CD-ROM" by
Walnut Creek CD-ROM (of Walnut Creek, California).
Its (United States) phone numbers are (800) 786-9907 or (510) 674-0783;
you can also send email to them at "info@cdrom.com".
<P>
<HR>
<P>
<B>On Installing a Web Browser</B>
<P>
Once you've installed Lovelace, which is essentially a set of data files,
you'll need to install a program to read those data files.
The kind of program you need is called a <EM>web browser</EM> or
<EM>HTML browser</EM>.
<P>
On many systems you may already have a web browser, so you don't have
to do anything more.
Common web browsers include Netscape, Mosaic, Cello, Lynx, and DosLynx.
If you <EM>don't</EM> have a web browser, you'll need to install one.
Here are some some options:
<UL>
<LI><EM>Netscape</EM>.
One of the best web browsers is a program called Netscape.
It's available on many different computer platforms.
It's not free, but it's inexpensive and very good.
<A HREF="http://www.netscape.com/">More information about
Netscape is available from Netscape Communications Corporation</A>.
<P>

<LI><EM>Microsoft Internet Explorer</EM>.
Microsoft Windows users may want to use Microsoft's <EM>Internet Explorer</EM>
as their web browser.
<A HREF="http://www.windows.microsoft.com/windows/ie/ie.htm">More
information about Internet Explorer is available</A>.
<P>

<LI><EM>Mosaic</EM>.
One of the better free web browsers is Mosaic, which is also
available on many different computer platforms.
More information is available on the
<A HREF="http://www.ncsa.uiuc.edu/SDG/Software/WinMosaic/HomePage.html">Microsoft
Windows version of Mosaic</A>, the
<A HREF="http://www.ncsa.uiuc.edu/SDG/Software/XMosaic">X/Unix version
of Mosaic</A>, and the
<A HREF="http://www.ncsa.uiuc.edu/SDG/Software/MacMosaic/MacMosaicHome.html">Apple
Macintosh version of Mosaic</A>.
<P>

<LI><EM>Cello</EM>.
For users with low-power IBM-PC compatibles
<A HREF="http://www.law.cornell.edu/cello/cellotop.html">Cello</A>
is a good choice.
Cello only requires 2M RAM, Microsoft Windows 3.1, and a 386 at 16Mhz or better.
Cello is free, and it's easy to install (you don't even need to install
Win32 or a TCP/IP stack for Windows 3.1).
It's also relatively straightforward to use Cello in "local" mode
(i.e. without a connection to the Internet).
<A HREF="http://www.law.cornell.edu/cello/cellotop.html">More
information about Cello is available</A>.
<P>

<LI><EM>DosLynx</EM>.
For users with really low-power IBM-PC compatibles (i.e.
MS-DOS only, a 286 or less, or less than 4Mb), you may want to look into
DosLynx.
<!-- Another HREF: ftp://ftp2.cc.ukans.edu/pub/DosLynx/readme.html -->
<A HREF="http://www.cc.ukans.edu/about_doslynx/doslynx.html">More
information about DosLynx is available</A>.
<P>

<LI><EM>Lynx</EM>.
For users with text-only systems, Internet access through text-only
interfaces, or visually impaired users, lynx may be a reasonable web browser.
<A HREF="http://www.cc.ukans.edu/about_lynx/about_lynx.html">More
information about lynx is available</A>.
<P>

<LI><EM>Other Browsers</EM>.
There are many other browsers; see
<A HREF="http://www.yahoo.com/Computers_and_Internet/Internet/World_Wide_Web/Browsers/">YAHOO's
list of web browsers</A>.
