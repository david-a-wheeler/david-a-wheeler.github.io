Welcome to Lovelace, an Ada95 tutorial developed by David A. Wheeler.

This directory contains a number of files for:
* Lovelace, an Ada95 tutor (a tutorial in HTML format).
  Lovelace includes "Small", a sample Ada program.
* mklesson, a tutor generator

The Lovelace tutorial & mklesson (tutorial generator)
are covered by the GNU General Public License and/or
Library General Public License; see the file "legal.html"
for more information. Unless otherwise noted, this material is
Copyright (C) 1994 David A. Wheeler.

This tutorial is delivered in HTML format, so you'll need to use some
sort of HTML viewer (e.g. a web browser) to read its content.
Just start your browser, view the directory Lovelace has been installed into,
and select "index.html" or "index.htm" (whichever is available).

These files are distributed on the World Wide Web,
with the current home page URL of:
 http://www.adahome.com/Tutorials/Lovelace/lovelace.html

See the file "install.txt" for installation instructions.

For local versions, use file "local.htm" as the home page.
You can also start at the main Lovelace menu, "lovelace.htm".

   ========================================================

This directory contains the following files:

readme        - This file
index.htm     - Startup file for viewing the local version of Lovelace.

The subdirectory "tutorial" contains basically "everything else".
This was done so that that the upper directory (which people will see first)
isn't so cluttered.  The subdirectory includes the following files:

install.txt   - Installation instructions
lovelace.htm  - The Lovelace home page.
local.htm     - The local version of Lovelace's home page.
                 This should be the home page for "local" users.
llstart.htm   - A copy of "local.htm" that points "down" into a lovelace
                directory.  You can move this file up one directory and then
                use it as your main point of entry (possibly changing its
                name to index.html).
master.htm    - The Lovelace master outline of lessons.

makefile      - Makefile to automatically regenerate lessons.
mklesson      - Perl program that takes .les files & generates .htm
template      - input file for mklesson
default       - input file for mklesson
userg.htm     - user guide on how to use mklesson.

lesson?.les   - Source for Lovelace lesson files.
lesson?.tim   - Timestamp file (changed when mklesson is run)
lesson?.htm   - Outline of the given lesson in .htm format
sX-Y.htm      - .htm file for lesson X, section Y of Lovelace.
                 If it's the final lesson, Y is 'f'.
sX-YrZ.htm    - .htm file for lesson X, section Y, response Z of Lovelace.

*.htm         - Hypertext viewable files in HTML format. These include:
legal.htm     - Information on ownership, distribution rights, etc.
tutors.htm    - A list of Ada Tutors (this was called "othert.htm").
helpmake.htm  - A plea for others to extend this tutorial & how to do it
dwheeler.htm  - A little about myself.
exclude       - A list of files to not put in local Lovelace tar file; used to
                enable correct creation of local tar file.  Excluded are:
                 + itself (lovelace.tar.gz); otherwise this file would
                   grow every time I distributed it.

lcount         - A Unix script to find out stats about the Lovelace tutorial
                 (how many sections it has, how many words, etc.)
stats          - A report of lcount at the time of this version's distribution.

Note: Many of the files ending in ".htm" once ended in ".html".

   ========================================================

If you've received the version of Lovelace that's integrated with
Cello (an HTML browser for PCs running Microsoft Windows),
you also received the following files:

1024-768.sty  -- style sheets for various screen sizes.
640-480.sty
800-600.sty
cello.bmk    -- Cello bookmark file
cello.exe    -- Cello executable
cello.ini    -- Initial values for Cello.
cello.ino    -- Original version of .ini file
cello.sig
cello.sto
cello.sty
clohelp.hlp
default.htm
readme.1st

If you received this integrated version but don't plan to run Cello
you can remove these additional Cello files.
