how to get Ada-related information on the web.
Many footnotes refer to web locations for more information.
<LI><B>Scaleable.</B>
An award-winning text-based role playing game is included.
This program shows how to apply various Ada capabilities together in
a complete program. An entire chapter is devoted to showing how to
