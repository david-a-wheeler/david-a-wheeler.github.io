Subprograms can call other subprograms so they can get work done.
Sometimes it's useful for a subprogram to call itself.
The technique of using a subprogram to call itself is
called <EM>recursion</EM>.
<P>
The standard example of recursion is computing the factorial of an Integer.
A factorial of some number n is defined as follows:
<OL>
<LI>if n is 0, the factorial of n is 1.
<LI>if n is more than 0, the factorial of n is equal to n times
the factorial of n-1.
</OL>
<P>
Recursive subprograms are written in a relatively standard format:
first, check for the "stopping" criteria of the recursion.
If the "stopping" criteria is not met, do part of the work and
then call "yourself" to complete the task.
<P>
Here's the factorial program:
<P>
<PRE>
function Factorial(A : in Integer) return Integer is
begin
 if A &lt; 0 then                -- Stop recursion if A &lt;= 0.
   raise Constraint_Error;
 elsif A = 0 then
    return 1;
 else
   return A * Factorial(A - 1);   -- recurse.
 end if;
end Sum;
</PRE>
<P>
Actually, you can implement the factorial using a "for" loop much more
easily, but more complicated problems are sometimes easier to handle
using recursion.

If you evaluated Factorial(5), how many times would the subprogram
Factorial be called?
<OL>
<LI><A HREF="s17s2r1.htm">Once.</A>
<LI><A HREF="s17s2r2.htm">Four times.</A>
<LI><A HREF="s17s2r3.htm">Five times.</A>
<LI><A HREF="s17s2r4.htm">Six times.</A>
</OL>
