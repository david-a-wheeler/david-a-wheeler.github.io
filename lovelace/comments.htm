Hi,
  I am working through the tutorial you have provided for Ada,
and find it very useful.
  I notice that in the Quiz of section 3.1 (Identifiers), you
have a question involving underlines.  As Netscape (browser I
am using) underlines links, it is impossible to distinguish
underlined from non-underlined.  I don't know if you were aware
of this.
Cheers,
Stephen.

Hi,
  I have finished the Lovelace course, so here is some feedback.

  Overall I fond it a very useful introduction to the language.  I
have some knowledge of other programming languages, and Lovelace
has provided useful in learning (some of) Ada.

  More specific comments:

... (various bugs)

   I have some background in OO (MODSIM II) so was able easily to
transfer my ideas from there to your Ada examples and text in section
7.  I am not sure how easily non-OO people would react to these,
but I notice in the 'to-do' that you mention this.

  Again, I found it very useful and good luck with adding further
tutorial sessions.

Cheers,
Stephen.

Subject: Lovelace Tutorial

    I just finished going through your Lovelace Ada tutorial and am
sending you comments. Ada is not needed for my job. I am taking a
programming languages course at American Univ. and our project
requires us to learn two new languages. I spread the tutorial over
three days. Two weeks ago I knew nothing about Ada, but I have been
reading a small text and lightly browsing the Ada 9X reference.

    Your tutorial is very easy, possibly too easy. I doubt that anyone
could write even a simple program with only Lovelace as his/her
background.

    I am writing a small program using the GNAT compiler from NYU and
I am having a lot of trouble understanding supplied packages. Lovelace
helped me understand what a package is and how to write my own small
package. What I am missing is an understanding of supplied packages.
As a new Ada programmer, I need to know what I/O packages every Ada
compiler should provide and how do I find what a particular compiler
is supplying. (For GNAT, I am told I should be browsing ????.ads
files.) In particular, I had trouble locating floating point I/O.

    Noone should expect to learn very much of a language from an
on-line tutorial, especially a free one. One should expect to be able
to write some simple (but more complex than "Hello World") programs to
get started.

    Please try take these comments in the best possible light. I was
very pleased to find an Ada tutorial on the WWW and I got a lot out of
it. I am just trying to gave back a little with some (hopefully)
constructive comments. In summary, my two suggestions are:

    1. Make the unit quizzes harder.

    2. Add a unit that talks about using supplied packages.

David,

Thanks for the reply about Lovelace.

...

By the way, I think that this is a very good way to learn to
use Ada. O can not only go at my own pace, but can do it when I
feel like it. I'm now on section 7 and the last many sections have
been really good, clear explanations, good examples and the quiz to
make sure you're understanding. Well done.

Are you constantly updating it, adding new pages?

Cheers,

Lee.

Hi David!

First, many thanks for your tutorial! 

I'm new to Ada, and I've tried to learn the language the last couple of 
weeks. Your tutorial gave me a "kick" to learn more about the language. 

I've finished the seven chapters, and I'm hungry for more... :)

Well, you mentioned at the end that someone wanted to translate the tutorial
into French, I'm interested in translating it into Swedish. I see this as
a very good chance for me to learn more about Ada. I've a book written by
Jan Skansholm in swedish, I belive the book has an english counterpart too.
The title is (freely translated from swedish) "Ada from the beginning - with
the Ada 9X standard". I guess you have heard of it, or even read it...
Well, I thought of using it when translating your tutorial into swedish. 
This gives me a reason to read the book too...

Well, if you think the world is interested in my project, please email me
about it, and I'll start as soon as possible.

Yours,
	Andreas Almroth

Hello,

   I just completed your tutorial.  Very good!  :-)  I knew most of the
material up until the OO programming, but it was a nice review.

   I hope you don't mind...I told my Real-Time Systems' professor about
your tutorial.  He had to teach Ada at the beginning of the semester and
felt as though it cut into the course.  Perhaps he will have his next
class go through your tutorial instead.  :-)

   One small thing, though...since many schools might still be using
an Ada83 compiler (we are, however I convinced my system administrator
to install GNAT for my project) perhaps you could cover a little more
on those features.

   At any rate, it is fine tutorial for beginners and a good review for
an intermediate.

Take Care!

Hi,

  I've completed your Ada tutorial. I hope there was more.
  With regards to OO programming, it would be good
to show how to `call super' in methods.
  Also, it is not clear how
    procedure Foo(X : Bar'Class)
interacts with
    procedure Foo(X : Bar) 
or methods for subclasses of Bar.
  Also, you don't state the possibility of dispatching
on the type of more than one argument, like in Common Lisp. 
  Finally, how to simulate multiple inheritance in Ada.

	David,

           This is just a quick message in reponse to using
     the Ada tutorial on the Internet.
 
     I'm currently studying for a BSC (Hons) p/t in a Computer
     Science course CSP1, at Hatfield University which is now
     covering ADA.
 
     I'm not really a programmer so your notes, in comparison
     to my tutor's are proving to be more understandable.
 
     As I have just started on Ada there isn't really too
     much I can add, except that the tutorial was very useful.
 
     I will be passing the WWW Ada address on to my other Uni.
     friends as I'm sure that they WILL find it very useful too.
 
     Thank-you for the time and effort in writing this.

just a few minutes ago I finished your Ada 95 tutorial. Since I already was
familiar with Ada 83 it did not offer much new to me, except of course the 
last section about object orientation. Nonetheless I enjoyed answering the
questions since I was always right :-) While doing this tutorial I always had
the impression that you created it especially for C/C++ programmers unfamiliar
with any typical features of languages from the Pascal family, what certainly
does not apply to me.

I look forward to see and run the next sections of the tutorial as soon as you
finish them.
Sincerly,

Mr. Wheeler,

In the past I have taken a couple of beginner programming courses and enjoyed
them.  My husband, a software engineer for Lockheed Martin, is now teaching
me programming at a more advanced level.  
His language of choice is Ada, and so I have been using that while studying
programming with a Pascal book: .  My husband is a good teacher, and the
authors have done a nice job of explaining themselves, but I think your
tutorial has helped me the most.  I thoroughly enjoyed your writing style.  I
also found your explanations of Object Oriented programming easier to
understand than the text I have been using.

What I appreciated most was the small, uncomplicated sample programs you
used.  So many books use examples that are three pages long and try to
incorporated three or four new ideas.

Thank you for this tutorial, and I look forward to your next.

Lisa Mae Bronkema

I have just completed the Ada tutorial and found it quite useful.
I am a post-grad student at George Mason University in Fairfax Virginia
who has just been introduced to Ada through a Software Construction course
which uses Ada examples.

I had to learn basic Ada in a few weeks using Koffman's book
and used your tutorial ^Learned Basic Ada..

as a review of what I just learned. So it serves up to that level quite well.
Thank you for your effort in preparing it.

NOw on to tasks...

As a relative "newbie" to the internet, it was nice to have something so
simple rather than have to download and convert etc.  It's also much
easier to understand and get a solid handle on ada than trudging

Hi

I have just been directed to have a look at your Lovelace
Project ... nice work!

I am working on a similar project, but my concern is as
much with providing SE tools over the Web as with presenting
information regarding Ada. Also I am concerned with initial
software development education rather than conversion as such.

As such I think out projects are complementary rather than
needless duplication of each other.

....

regards

fintan

Thanks a lot for Lovelace.  Being probably a rather experienced Ada

better.  In fact, I've also recommended Lovelace to (potential) Ada
newbies already.

I finished LOVELACE about a week ago.  It has left a good impression on me, 
the same good impression I had when I sent the e-mail two (?) weeks ago...

I have more detailed feedback for you but I think that you should be 
aware that it comes from the perspective of a novice programmer ...

I don't know what kind of people you were aiming for in LOVELACE, but I 
think it does an outstanding job of nurturing the interest of someone 
who is truly interested in Ada 95.  I noticed that you described it as 
a whirlwind tour.  I think that is true, but it was a whirlwind tour 
with many opportunities for brief reflection and with directions for 
detailed inquiries.  Specifically, I think that the quizzes with comments 
for both the right and the wrong answers really helps a novice, like me, 
to get some sense of progress.  Of course, more can be learned by working 
through full blown exercises but I think it might break the momentum of 
someone who is curious about Ada 95 in a self-motivated way.  I also 
thought it was a good idea to include pointers to other sources of 
information about Ada.  Additionally, I did take a glance at your strawman 
list of things to-do and am particularly intrigued by your idea of 
"dynamically" building a program within the tutorial.

I do intend to nominate it for an educational Best of the Web, just as 
soon as that is possible!

I feel that I have gotten something out of LOVELACE and would like to 
contribute something in order to show my appreciation.  I looked at the 
Team Ada FAQ sheet, but I'm afraid that I'm not really in a position to do
much help.  About all that I can do is provide feedback of a simple nature.

And congratulations to you and your wife about your baby daughter.
Take care.

Subject: Lovelace Ada Tutorial 

I just completed your Lovelace Ada Tutorial.  I thought it was very well  
done.  I've had minimal exposure to Ada in the past, but expect to get
more involved now with Ada95 out and the mandate being more rigorously  
enforced.

The lessons are broken up and ordered very well.  I could do a couple
of lessons each morning before getting on to my other work.  The
sections of each lesson are small enough that even if I got interrupted  
in the middle of a lesson it was only a short distance back to recover  
at a logical break.

I especially liked the end-of-section quizzes.  They tended to ensure
that I absorbed what I'd read and hadn't just scanned it without  
engaging my brain (something that's easy to do when reading long  
technical documents).  Even the sections with simple questions kept me  
awake, so here's an area for improvement:  Add a Quiz to the sections  
that don't have them, even if it's just a regurgitation of what was  
presented a couple of paragraphs above.

The only chance for improvement was that there were a few typos, these  
seemed to be more prevalent in the last few lessons -- in particular  
there are some missing or extra articles or connecting words.  I think
"prefin" is used someplace that should be "predefin".  None of the typos  
obscured the meaning of the text.

The hypertext links are also a good inclusion, I only followed a few but  
may come back for some more in the future.

I have recommended this tutorial to my colleagues.  Thanks for offering  
this resource.

Hi David!

     I just completed your Lovelace Ada Tutorial.  I took it for two reasons:

       1) I am using Ada again, and haven't used it for a couple years
       2) Though I did/do know Ada, I don't yet know Ada 95.  (While we are
          using Ada 83, I want to try to assure I don't use identifiers or
          similarly cause a transition problem when moving to Ada 95.)

     I think it's a very good job!  Keep up the great work!

Ok, here's the request you made.

I actually liked the tutorial, it gave me a lot of information.  I hope that
you continue to develop it, maybe even having the tutorial develop a semi-real
application so that concepts could be more easily absorbed.

Also, consider adding sections like "Ada for C programmers" and "Ada for Pascal
Programmers", too.

Thanks again.

Excellent tutorial.  I've been studying Ada for 6 months and never grasped much
in the lectures.  I'm was in a right panic about the end of year exam and the
assignments I have to complete before the end of the year.  This tutorial
explained every-thing really clearly.  I feel confident that I can finish the
Ada paper I am studying and perhaps pass.

David,

    I just completed your nice Ada tutorial and found it very useful as
    a quick 'crash course' of the language. IMHO it is a brilliant idea
    to include more general sections like those on programming safety
    and efficiency.

    The only problem I encountered was that GNAT (at least 2.06 for
    OS/2) doesn't always raise Constraint_Error exceptions when it
    should. This is of course not your fault, but I think it would be a
    good idea to warn GNAT users that they might experience some
    difference between theory and practice - as long as GNAT is a work
    in progress.

Dear Mr. Wheeler:


	I'm using your Lovelace for courses I taught here using GNAT
Ada 95. Students were giving hardcopies I prepared for them for these
who do not find it convenient to browse on the Web using slow machines 
in our PC lab.

...


        Your work in Lovelace is a great time-safer for my teaching here 
since good text on Ada 95 is still not readily available in book format. 
Navigating with Lovelace in mind also add much meaning to the Web surfing 
to many of our students here.

	Thanks for your work.

Mr. Wheeler,
I would like to thank you for putting together such a fine Ada tutorial
(Lovelace).  I am currently a graduate student at George Mason University
working on an M.S. in Info Systems and a graduate certificate in Software
Systems Engineering, something I believe you know a bit about.  SWSE 619 is
what has prompted me to learn Ada and your tutorial is making it quite
enjoyable.

I do have one question for you.  Do you know of any Internet newsgroups or
forums where someone such as myself might be able to post questions about
Ada?  Specifically, I'm trying to find out if there is an Ada equivalent to
C's getche() function for accepting character by character input without a
carriage return.  If you know of any newsgroups, or happen to know the
answer to the question itself, I would very much appreciate a quick email
from you.  I can be reached at &lt;crowley@cybercash.com&gt;.

Thank you again for your tutorial and your help!

Chris Crowley

[The newsgroup is comp.lang.ada, and yes, Ada 95 includes
 a function Get_Immediate to do exactly that.]

Dave:

I've been browsing for a good Ada tutorial. Looked at your page. I think 
I'll be using it as a tutorial. I've got gnat installed under Linux on my 
486DX2/66. Mostly, I program using C, and C++. I think Ada is worth 
investigating for me (a consulting programmer).

Going through your on-line resume, I see you're quite well versed in many 
disciplines. Then I noticed on your web page you wrote:

&gt;Most important to me, I'm a Christian.

This was refreshing to see. God rewards and guides those who put Him 
first. He has blessed me also with a great job and a sound mind. I've got 
to finish getting ready for church, this morning.

God bless,

Jon Berndt

David,

Appreciate your considerable efforts in developing the

MS-DOS ftp-able version in self-unzipping format?
(I don't have the correct PKUNZIP version).  Again,
thanks for the hard work.  Take care.

[ You can get a more current "unzipping" program from  
  ftp://ftp.uu.net/pub/archiving/zip 
 as explained in the "downloading Lovelace" page. 
 
 I'd be happy to provide a self-unzipping file, but the only program 
 I know of that does that is "pkzip", which is shareware ($). 
 Since I get absolutely NO money from distributing Lovelace, I can't 
 really justify buying pkzip just for that purpose.  Also, it would be
 a pain to distribute, since I'd have to download to a PC, zip, and then
 upload. 
  
 If you could find a free way for me to create self-extracting "zip" files 
 from a Sun Sparc, I'd be pleased to do it.

Very nice tutorial.  I am taking a graduate-preparatory 
course at NYU, and we are using Ada.  Here's a suggestion:

When introducing a new statement or syntax, start with some 
simple examples.  Don't ever jump right into the BNF 
diagram.  It's easier to understand a given BNF if you've 
already gotten a feel for the construct that it 
illustrates.

Slow down.  Obviously, this is just a function of how much 
time you and others have had to flesh this thing out.  
Lovelace is an excellent introduction to the main ideas and 
capabilities of Ada95, but it doesn't yet serve as an 
adequate textbook.  This may not have been what you 
originally had in mind for Lovelace, but why not?  It 
doesn't have to be done all at once.

Good luck and thanks for the knowledge!

-Samuel Fredland, NYC


[I went through Lovelace and put examples before every BNF, and
gave him a draft version to see what he thought of the changes.

As far as "slowing down" goes, it's hard to please everyone; I don't talk
about if-then-else and loops until lesson 3, and you have to get through
lesson 9 before you can even do trivial I/O!  I'm trying to strike a
balance between too slow and too fast; please let me know if there are
specific changes you'd recommend. ]

Just completed section 4.2 of rev. 4.5 of Lovelace.  The question is a 
little tricky because if A is the name of a type that is visible in the 
scope of the declaration

procedure Delete_File( Integer : A );

then it IS a legal declaration.  "INTEGER" is a predefined type, not a 
keyword.


[My reply was: if you understand Ada that well, you probably don't need
a tutorial!  However, I'll try to add a note about that subtlety somewhere]

I just finished my first pass through your tutorial.  I was informed  
that I would be moving on to an Ada95 project and requested information  
on in-house Ada training from our training department.  I ended up with  
a taped 4 day crash course on Ada that was difficult to sit through.  I  
found your tutorial during a search for Ada info.

I found your tutoral to be well organized, fast moving, and a source of  
additional resources.  I have already recommended your tutorial to my  
boss and others.  As indicated above I plan on going through the  
tutorial again after I take the plunge and start writing code.

                                               Thanks

Dave,

  Nice demo, nice tool.  I think i'll use it in a class next semester.

[I] suggest you mirror the .ch stuff in this country.  It's taking a
loooong time to load each page.

 The tool and demo are mirrored in the "PAL" (Public Ada Library),
 and the PAL is mirrored in many other places (including CD-ROMs).
 You can also download it, and soon there will be a book! ]

Dear Mr. Wheeler,
     Thank you for posting the announcement of Lovelace 5.0 in comp.lang.ada.
I presently access the Internet through America Online, which costs five
cents a minute.  So I prefer to run your excellent tutorial off line.
     I have an off line .HTML browser, and in the past have run a copy of
Lovelace found on an Ada CD-ROM  -  I believe the one from Walnut
Creek.  Is there any way I can download the entire new version of
Lovelace?  (If not, I'll wait until Lovelace 5.0 appears on a CD-ROM,
or until I decide I can afford a flat-rate Internet Service Provider!)

     Thanks for your time, and I hope you have a blessed and happy
Christmas and New Year.

- John Herro

[ Lovelace has been downloadable since its early versions, yet somehow
  many people are missing this.  I've bolded the "download Lovelace" on the
  home page; I refuse to use "Blink" to highlight this. Lovelace
  is also available via the Public Ada Libary (PAL), Walnut Creek CD-ROM,
  ez2load, and many other sources.]

you're probably going to think i am a real pain in the butt.  i found

in one of the lovelace tutorial web pages.

in http://www.adahome.com/Tutorials/Lovelace/s15-f.htm it says

'To declare a private package, just append the word "private":'

i think you meant 'prepend'.

considering that this is the first error that i noticed in 15 sections,
i'd say that's pretty
good.  in fact, i like layout and language of the tutorial very much.

Dear Mr. Wheeler,

I am teaching a software engineering course at the College
of William &amp; Mary in Virginia, and I decided to use Ada (95)
and gnat as the basis for the semester-long software project
the students have to do as teams. I would like them to use
your tutorial, but it is esentially unusable -- it takes to
long to load pages from Switzerland. (I am using the
lglwww.edfl.ch site.) I would like to know if there is a
closer (faster) site, or even if I could download the tutorial
so that it would be local.

I found this speedy and tidy, with allowances for my ignorance of American
terminology. I drove through it in about 4 hours, attacking the quiz questions
and then, in the event of failure, tracking down the reason for my
mis-understanding.

I do not, however, understand 'program'. I understand sub-program, package,
task unit and generic unit - but do not see how to make a program. You discuss
the procedure Small, but I do not see the program which contains it. At this
point I wished for an index to Lovelace, to find where I had missed the
definition of a 'program', to find the first mention of the concept.

[I'll try to make this clearer in future versions]

I also found some of the html links had come adrift. I could not access the
document on style.

[I'll try to fix such links! Thanks!]

I just wanted to say that I like the Ada tutorial you've written..
I'm a beginning CS major (with two years under my belt)
and I am really interested in Ada, especially since ada95
and GNAT have come of age.

Are there interfaces in Ada for graphical programming, such as
X-Windows?  I suppose it wouldn't be too hard to encapsulate all the
C functions into Ada packages...

...

anyway, I'm rambling;  The tutorial is great!

helpful in learning the major changes in Ada95 as well as the tasking

David,

   While the tutorial, at least as far as I've been through, is quite useful,
the answer to the quiz in section 10.2 is incorrect.  You ask which statement
defines an exception called No_Safety_Net, when actually the statement defines
an exception called Safety_Net.  I normally don't point out errors, but that
one might leave some users with an erroneous expectation about how to name
and reference exceptions.

    Thanks for the tutorial,
         Marty Pinaud

Hi David.

I've just had a look at your latest extensions to Lovelace. Grrrrrreat!

Your explanations on Java, and how to use Ada to write applets are good.
I'm going to download the whole tutorial, so I can have a closer look 
later.

Cheers,

Jacob

Thank you very much for the Ada tutorial on the WEB. I just thought that
I would let you know that I found it very useful indeed. I consider it
to be amongst the better written tutorials that are on the WWW these
days (ie easy to read yet complete and not using jargon!).

Again, thankyou,

David,

First of all, I want to tell you great I think your ADA tutorial is.  I
have found it to be very useful in getting an idea of what ADA is all
about.

My interest in ADA is due to the fact that I will be taking a computer
science class this fall that is taught with ADA.  Previously, it was
taught with Pascal.  I was concerned that I would have to work in the
lab all of the time because I wouldn't be able to get my hands on an
ADA compiler at a reasonable price.  Well, I found one for free (GNAT)
- you can't get more reasonable than that.  So, I will be able to work
on my projects on my PC here at home.

Thanks,
Rich Maggio

I did find several defects though, and will send you a

I like the web-ada integration, that's neat.

David,
	I am currently working through your Ada '95 Lovelace tutorial on the Web.  Section 6.7 needs 
some editing such as:

	"...anyone who withs the package will be able to anything to your new type..."
	"...If you happen to base it on on type Integer, ..."
	"...Even if you really only customers to use "less than" as an "ordering" concept, ..."
	"...and as a results you can change your type much more easily..."
	"... Notice also you to create a constant value without saying exactly 
	     what its value is;..."

David, 

I just completed the Lovelace Ada tutorial and per your
request, I wanted to drop you a note letting you know that I'd
done so.  I'm very familiar with Ada83, so I was mainly
concerned with learning what's new with Ada95.  While the
tutorial, of course, covered a lot that I already knew, I
found it's links to the appropriate on-line style guides and
manuals quite helpful.   

I'm cc:-ing this e-mail to the Best-of-Web folks to put in my
vote for your site:

&gt;2. Build your own.  You'll need to know more than you know now. 
&gt;That's not a bad thing - it will give you a reason to learn more. 

As I get into this I doubt it will ever get finished but it is interesting
and forcing me to learn more about Ada.  After I get a significant chunk
written in Ada and feel I am somewhat competant at OO I will have a look
at C++ or some other OOL to write another section.
 
&gt;I strongly recommend that you start by looking at other adventure game
&gt;implementations. By reading them, you'll learn about how different
&gt;people have solved similar problems.  See the MUD FAQ for more info.

I am currently reading the ng.s haven't seen the FAQ yet.

&gt;Try out my "Lovelace" tutorial, it culminates in a text adventure game.
&gt;The advantage is that you'd be able to see one approach to building such
&gt;a system, and it's small enough that you can easily understand the whole

I am currently reading throught Lovelace, quite nicely done :)

Thanks for the note, David.

I'll update the PAL as well.  Unfortunately, the next Ada CDROM just entered
production with version 5.3 of Lovelace, but 5.5 will make the CDROM that
targets Tri-Ada 96.

You've done an excellent job with Lovelace, including the updates covering
Java.  Keep up the good work.

&gt; Lovelace 5.5 is now on HBAP.

David,

On page 12.4 of the Lovelace tutorial
(http://www.adahome.com/Tutorials/Lovelace/s12-4.htm),
you have the following fragment:

----

  type Tree_Node; -- Incomplete type declaration.
  type Tree_Access is access Tree_Node;
  type Tree_Node is
    record
      Parent      : Tree_Access;
      Left, Right : Tree_Access;
      Data        : Unbounded_String;
    end record;

Here's an example of statements using this tree data structure, if A and
B are of type Tree_Access: 

  A := new List_Node;
  B := new List_Node;
  A.Data := To_Unbounded_String("Hello!");   -- assign some data
  B.Data := To_Unbounded_String("Goodbye!");
  A.Left := B;                               -- connect them.
  B.Parent := A;

----

Note the incorrect statements

  A := new List_Node;
  B := new List_Node;

which should be

  A := new Tree_Node;
  B := new Tree_Node;

Hi David,

I'm in Lovelace section 11.1 and something isn't 
completely clear (first time this has happened thus 
far so I'd say you've done a great job with the 
tutorial!).  Do I understand correctly that you can 
instantiate all three types using the same name 
"Swap."  I'm assuming this is the polymorphic 
behavior of Ada that lets the run-time system 
decide which instance of Swap to invoke based on 
the type of the passed arguments, but isn't wasn't 
explicitly stated that way in the tutorial.

Thanks,
Matt

Hi David,

I completed Lovelace today.  I spent probably 4-5 
hours on it over several sessions.  I found it very 
informative and easy to follow.  Good job!

I really have few criticisms.  The continual 
compare and contrast with C and C++ was great. 
Although, since the last language I was really 
proficient with was VAX Fortran, it was of less 
help to me than to those proficient in C or C++.

Matt Whiting

Mr Wheeler,

Now that I've completed your Lovelace tutorial, I am obediently
responding to your call for e-mail.  I found the Lovelace tutorial
quite enjoyable.  The tiny sections were very conducive to reading.
I will attempt to helpfully give you constructive criticism.

The quiz questions were a good idea, and I am confident that they
helped. You could easily get away with having two or even three
questions, possibly more involved than what is there currently.  More
important, however, is fleshing out explanations of answers
thoroughly.  (Occassionally I found it irritating to be told simply,
``Correct,'' when I wanted to be sure whether I was right about what
made the answer correct.)

Another possible change would be to recommend skipping sections
occassionally.  A student might be interested in only of the existence
and applications of some features (tasks, Java applets, and
other-language compatibility come to mind), deferring the details to
later when the occassion to use it actually arises. I found the Java
sections particularly tedious, at least until some day I find I want to
develop Java applets.

Really, however, the tutorial is a marvelous thing and am now anxious
to find something to create using Ada. Thank you for making this
available!

David,

I am really enjoying the Lovelace tutorial.  In going through it I have
noticed one small typo.  The word between the ***s appears to be
missing.

In section 6.7:

"we've discussed so far. If you happen to base it on type Integer, your
customers can still add, subtract, and so on. Even
if you really only ***want*** customers to use "less than" as an
"ordering" concept, the customers may not realize what limitations
you had in mind and use all sorts of other operations. If you"

Dear Mr. Wheeler:

In the bibliography of the 2nd edition of my book "Object-Oriented Software
Construction" I would like to list the reference to your Ada 95 tutorial
which I found at

	 http://lglsun.epfl.ch/Ada/Tutorials/Lovelace/dwheeler.htm

A few questions: 

	- Is this the right URL? (Or is it
	  a mirror site, and if so what is the better address to give?)

	- Do you expect the URL to remain valid for several years (the
	  hoped shelf life of my book)?

I will be grateful for answers on these two points.

I graduated with a BSEE from UCF in the spring of '89.  I never had an
ADA class.  I have used FORTRAN in the past. Just recently I started a
new job where ADA is used for aircraft operational flight programs and
controls and displays programs. My first successful OFP software build
was completed a couple of weeks ago.  

After about two weeks of the tutorial I wrote my first stand alone
program to convert polar coordinates to rectangular coordinates using
VAX ADA.  This gave me the confidence to persue the OFP.  

Your tutorial goes above and beyond what I need to know to do the OFP
and CDP but that is fine with me.

I would have liked to have seen a little more on pragmas.  
I understand this is a powerful feature with very broad implications.
Other than that it was perfect.

Thank you very much,

Hi, Dave,

Glad to 'meet' you.  Just heard about your tutorial and logged on to check it
out.  Looks great; only one problem.  In the first sample program, instead of
nice formatted code, I see only a single line, with little squares where the
'new lines' should be.  I can scroll across to see all the lines, but this
obviously will become pretty difficult when the examples get longer.  Any
suggestions?

I'm accessing via AOL and Windows 3.1.

Hi !

Thank you for this great tutorial.
I'm student in astrophysics and I will
try to develop a few applications in Ada.
I was really interested by all the tutorial,
except the link to java. But perhaps later will
find usefull to work with Java...

Sincerly,

Hi David,
	Lovelace tutorial is for people who love Ada, particularly 
learning Ada 95. I have finished learning your WWW Lovelace tutorial, 
and I love it! I appreciate what you have contributed your talents and 
Ada language expertise on your WWW Lovelace tutorial home page, so that 
everyone can learn your genuity about Ada tutorial and keep up with new 
features and flexibility of Ada 95.
	Please let me know if you upgrade your Lovelace tutorial home 
page with new capabilities of Ada 95 in practice.
It's been a beautiful work!
Thanks.
Tony.

Hi, David,

Windows 95 does not support RR.  That's a BIG audience.  I'd suspect
Windows/NT as well.

In your other message, you brought up a good point that underscores
rather than dashes may fix the ISO9660 problems but introduce others
elsewhere.  I had not thought of that, and you're right.  How about
this solution: replace the dashes with letters (like x or p) so that
all file names are alphanumeric?  THAT should ensure portability.

What do you think?
Rick
&gt;  Actually, I think the only system which doesn't support the
&gt; RR extensions is the Mac. Can you tell me about the systems
&gt; for this is ISN'T working?

Subject: Feedback on the Lovelace Tutorial

          Hello, David.
          
               I am Roger McGargill with Rockwell International in the 
          Collins Avionics and Communication Division. I'm a newly 
          hired software engineer. One of my tasks was to evaluate the 
          ADA 95 Lovelace tutorial as a possible replacement for the 
          ADA course offered here. I was the ideal person to evaluate 
          this as I never studied ADA 83 or ADA 95 and am well-versed 
          in C, and studied FORTRAN and Pascal ages ago. 
          
               I went through the entire 18 chapters of the tutorial 
          and have come away very impressed at how clear it was and 
          how it allowed me to proceed at my own pace. I'd like to 
          share with you some feedback and ask a few questions, if 
          that is okay with you.
          
               The entire tutorial was well-organized and taught the 
          fundamentals of ADA well in the first seven chapters which 
          was appreciated by me ! :) There was references to C, 
          Pascal, and other languages that gave me the basic idea such 
          as data types, procedures, functions, and so on forth. I 
          felt that the tutorial was very through and brought me 
          through a bit at a time so that I wasn't overloaded with 
          information at once. The quizzes was a great way to check my 
          knowledge and if the point of the lesson had stuck in my 
          mind. 
          
               I do have some concerns. The main concern is that I was 
          not able to download the sample programs after being 
          complied so that I could try them out. I don't have an ADA 
          95 compiler yet and probably won't for a while.  I strongly 
          felt that testing the sample programs out would reinforce 
          the lessons learned so far. I also could change some lines 
          to see how the result would be. 

[I've discussed this with the maintainers of "WebAda".  They intend
 in the future to permit downloading of executables and/or to return
 Java programs that automatically run once compilation completes.
 I do not know when these capabilities will be available.]
          
               Another concern is object oriented programming. That 
          was the most difficult area for me as I have little 
          experience with object-oriented programming (soon to be 
          rectified soon! :) ). The section on general object-oriented 
          program, 7.1,  was a big plus for me and helped me with the 
          rest of the lesson. I would have benefited from more 
          illustrations in Lessons 7.2 through 7.6. 

[This is hard to balance, since many people _are_ familiar with
object-oriented programming and I don't want to bore them.]
          
               Those are the main concerns and feedback that I had. It 
          took me 12 hours over three days' time to complete the 
          tutorial. Naturally, my eyes were tired after spending so 
          much time and have recommended to my supervisor to space it 
          out more to approximately five to six days with some local 
          lab exercises, and a local point of contact for any 
          questions. 

[The printed version of Lovelace should help your eyes substantially!]
          
               I do have a few questions - 
          
          1) Section 2.4 was not clear to me... an example after the 
          BNF would have helped.

[I've added an example in section 2.4 based on your comments]
          
          2) Section 4.1 - It says that it depends on the compiler and 
          machine on the "most natural" size for the integer type. How 
          do I find out the max. bit size as some of my work involves 
          assembly language. 

[See section 17.1]
          
          3) Section 5.2 - For loops. This section was clear on how to 
          code for loops except for one thing. What's the syntax if I 
          need a loop with an increment or decrement of more than one? 

[I've added text to mention that, in this case, you can't use "for" loops.]
           
               I also would like to get your opinion on if the 
          tutorial should really replace the ADA 95 course which is 
          being taught by an instructor and how well would it work?  I 
          am quite interested in your paperback tutorial, "ADA 95: The 
          Lovelace tutorial". To the best of your knowledge, when will 
          it be out by? 

[That depends on many factors, including the quality of the instructor,
 the kind of the students you have, and the level of knowledge desired.
 Lovelace teaches you enough about Ada to write basic programs and
 also shows you how to learn more about the areas it omits.
 If the students are reasonable self-starters, that may be enough.
 Having an instructor has a number of advantages, though.  An
 instructor can reinforce key issues, answer questions, and become a
 mentor (helping you learn how to use various capabilities to solve
 your problems).  There's no conflict here; Lovelace can be an aid
 the instructor, and a number of instructors are already using Lovelace.

 For hobbyists, Lovelace by itself is enough.  For professional work,
 Lovelace could be used by itself but I suspect it's best used as one of
 several methods to help get developers "up to speed".  An instructor's
 reinforcement would probably also help developers understand and apply
 what they learn. Also, in professional settings, it's definitely best to
 have an experienced person easily available when starting to use
 any tool (including Ada).

 In most college settings, Lovelace is an aid to the instructor;
 students can learn the basics from Lovelace and then ask the instructor
 specific questions.  In college, the instructor is usually interested
 in teaching issues other than simply a language itself, so Lovelace
 can really aid the instructor by reducing his/her workload.]

	       Thank you for your time as this is quite a long letter!
	  I'd like to hear from you regarding my questions and
	  comments. Have a nice day...

Dave,

I've noted that a problem has come up with Lovelace re portability,
and I was wondering if you could possibly fix it for the next Ada
CDROM, which starts production on 15 Oct.

It's in the file names.  You used dashes as a part of several names.
A dash is not a valid char to the ISO9660 format for CDROMs.  Walnut
Creek automatically translated these to underscores, but that broke
the version of Lovelace on the CDROM.

I know this is a lot of work, but it would really make the Lovelace
distribution better.  Lovelace still runs directly from the CDROM
on most UNIX platforms, which support ISO9660 with the Rock Ridge
extensions (this allows dashes and longer file names).  However, MSDOS,
Win95, WinNT, etc., don't work.

Looking forward to your reply,
Rick

Facts /can/ actually change opinions...

A few weeks ago I installed a local version of the Lovelace tutorial on
our corporate intranet (and put up EZ2LOAD for downloading). Much to my
supprise, this proved to be somewhat of a success.

Logs showed that quite a number of our programmers (mostly Windows/C++
types) looked at it. And in new project meetings, Ada is now routinely
considered as an implementation language (quite a change from the normal
'Ada is *@%!' attitude!).

Some C++ types are looking at GNAT and ObjectAda for the next version for our
traffic guidance system (which runs in a CORBA-like enviroment).
And a new commercial website is being implemented using GNAT for the CGI
'scripts'.

Moral: Ada is its own bestselling argument. And maybe your employer has a
intranet too...

Since you wanted the email message, I thought I should contribute.
I did enjoy doing the questions. Good to see a sense of humour in the
answer too (I had more smiley faces than X's). I skimmed over ADA a
couple of years ago and wasn't aware that it had been updated (i.e., ADA
95). I found the URL for this tutorial using YAHOO! because I was
looking for information regarding the use of concurrency in ADA. I'm
actually more interested in the hardware design language VHDL which, as
you probably know, is based on ADA. I'll stop now. This short note is
nolonger short.

I hope this has made your day worthwhile ;)

Dear David A. Wheeler,

Just thought you might like to know... In perusing your Lovelace
tutorial today, I attempted to use the link for the Ada95rm for section
7.6 and the link was bad.

Overall I like the tutorial itself, but feel a little bit like a hog for
keeping an Internet link tied up the whole time while --reading-- a
screen.  I realize that you are working to publish a paper copy, but my
personal preference would be to load it onto my local machine and run it
interactively with the Netscape browser without the connect time
charges.  Hmmmmm.

Thanks for the very helpful tutorial,

Liese Agee
lagee@scires.com

p.s. I've been using Ada83 since 1988 and still would call Ada my
language of choice.

David,

     I just finished taking the Lovelace Tutorial and it was great.  I
loved the quizzes you have in most sections.  They are highly effective in
reinforcing the concepts introduced in the related section and you came up
with a really good set of alternative choices. So many multiple choice
quizzes have some stock ridiculous answers, yours don't (except that 10,000
tasks thing in Section 13.1) and the quizzes are uniformly excellent.  I
just wish you had a quiz in EVERY section.  You might want to think about
going back in and adding some extra quizzes where there aren't ones now
(for example, in Section 6.4, add a quiz that emphasizes the fact that Ada
has "real" enumerations, not just named associations to integer constants
like C/C++).

     Anyway, I wanted to say something positive before I started listing
some (minor) problems I noticed.  Overall, Lovelace is excellent, but there
are a few things about it that I thought I'd point out to you.

     Some background on myself.  I have both a BS &amp; MS in Computer Science,
and my MS had emphasis in Software Engineering and OO.  I just started a
new assignment at TRW where we're going to be (ultimately) using Ada 95. 
It was recommended that I review your Lovelace tutorial to see if it was
appropriate to use as "required reading" for new programmers on the project
(many of whom have previously programmed in Jovial).  I started programming
in Ada in 1986 on a project for the Air Force.  That went on for 7 years. 
I've also programmed in C and C++ on other projects at TRW, so I'm familiar
with all 3 languages.  
     I haven't used Ada in about 3 years, and I used Lovelace as both a
refresher on Ada and as an intro to Ada 95 (although I reviewed some of the
early 9x documents many years ago).

Problems:
     There are several things which seem to violate the "Ada 95 Quality and
Style: Guidelines for Professional Programmers; Oct. 95 version".  
     It bothers me a bit that new programmers taking the tutorial (many of
whom are just learning Ada, of which there are quite a few, judging on your
comments page) are having these coding techniques reinforced in their minds
by the provided code samples.  This is similar to the way that C
programmers tend to mimic the style of coding samples from the book they
learned C from.  
     We were also wondering if we should buy copies of your book for
programmers coming up to speed on our new project, and since I can only
(currently) see the electronic version, it is my window into what the
printed book will look like, thus the following comments.

1) The use of Mode Indication.  
      The Ada 95 Q&amp;S Guide (Section 5.2.4) recommends that the mode be used
for all procedure and entry parameters, not to just use the default mode of
"in".  I agree with this, and it has been an explicit coding standard on
every Ada project I've worked.  In fact, you yourself state (in Section 4.2
of your tutorial) "The default mode is `in', but I recommend that you
always state the desired mode."  
     You then violate this in code fragments in (it seems as though you
rarely, use the solo "in", instead relying on the default "in" in your
code):

     An answer for the Section 6.7 Quiz (s6sfr2.htm)
     All of the function/procedure declarations in Section 7.2 (s7s2.htm)
     Procedure View in section 7.4 (s7s4.htm)
     Set functions in Section 7.6 (s7s6.htm)
     Section 8.4, Print_Reverse (s8s4.htm)
     Your Ustring package spec &amp; body (ustrings.ads &amp; .adb) referenced in
Section 8.6
     Procedure Show_File in Section 9.4 (s9sf.htm)
     Procedure Open_Or_Create in Section 10.3 (s10sf.htm)
     HEY!  You use the solo "in" in your Generic_Stack package (Section
12.7)
     On the Entry &amp; Accept for Babbler's Start in Section 13.2 (s13s2.htm)
     All function declarations in section 16.2 (s16s2.htm)
     All of the function/procedure declarations in Section 16.6 (s16s6.htm)
    
2) The use of Named Association.  
      I realize that the Ada 95 Q&amp;S Guide (Section 5.2.2) has an "out" in
the Notes part of Section 5.2.2 in the form of the statement "Certainly,
simple or familiar subprograms.....do not require the extra clarification
of named association in the procedure call."  But you rarely (if ever) use
named association in your code examples.  I can see this as appropriate for
calls like Put_Line and other very common I/O functions that would
(theoretically) be used all the time by programmers and so should be very
familiar to them.  But you don't even use it on your "pragma" examples in
section 16.1, it seems that this would be a good opportunity to show named
association being used in code examples.  (I did notice you using it in
your "Small" program, but I don't know if every person taking the tutorial
is going to scrutinize the code of "Small".)

     Something that bothered me in section 11.3 was the fact that you
explicitly say "The 'Size =&gt;' and 'Item =&gt;' are optional; you could omit
them if you wanted to."  This is almost endorsing the position of NOT using
named association, especially when coupled with the fact that it is rarely
seen in example code in the tutorial.

3) Using "Use" clauses to allow you to reference
procedures/functions/variables/etc. declared in other packages without
using the full "dot" notation.  
     This is very "C"-like, where you see a function call or a variable
reference and have no idea where it is really declared.  What follows is a
scavenger hunt through all the #include files in C/C++ and through all the
"with"ed files in Ada.

     The Ada 95 Q&amp;S states (in section 5.7.1):
     "Ada's ability to enforce information hiding and separation of
concerns through it's visibility controlling features is one of the most
important advantages of the language.  Subverting these features, for
example, by too liberal use of the use clause, is wasteful and dangerous."
     In the same section, under rationale, the Q&amp;S also says:
     "Use of the use clause may indeed make the code read more like prose
text.  However, the maintainer may also need to resolve references and
identify ambiguous operations."
     On Ada projects I've worked, we have limited the use of the use clause
to allow visibility of overloaded operators ONLY.  In Section 2.4
(s2s4.htm) where you first introduce use clauses, you explicitly state "use
clause - automatically search Ada.Text_IO" and then when you use Put_Line
"Note: No longer has 'Ada.Text_IO' in front".  This seems to be an explicit
endorsement of the fact that it's easier to code without using the dot
notation.  As I'm sure you're well aware, the majority of software
lifecycle costs are in test/maintenance, not in development.  Saving the
coder a few keystrokes (when it damages the readability of the code for
maintainers) isn't a good thing.

----------------------

     Anyway, I guess what I'm saying is that when you write a tutorial like
this, you are exposing students to styles of coding which will most likely
stay with them.  If you don't follow the recommended coding styles, you
should at least explicitly point out how and why you're violating them
(e.g., for readability in your tutorial examples).  This should be followed
up by an explicit statement of the applicable Q&amp;S guideline (with
examples).  Just putting a link to the Q&amp;S guide doesn't seem to be
sufficient to me.

Questions:
     Are the code fragments in the paper(/book) version of Lovelace largely
the same (e.g., little use of "in" &amp; named association and overuse of
"use")?  I did notice that you are more liberal in your use of "in" and
named association in the "Small" source code I perused.
     Are there more quizzes in the book?  
     Either of the above would be an incentive to buy the book.

     Again, I don't want to be completely negative.  Overall I think
Lovelace is a great tutorial, just a few nips and tucks here and there
could address most of the issues I raised.

     Thanks for a great on-line tutorial.

[I've added the mode indications.  I use "Use" clauses simply
because the most of my code examples are intentionally short.

format between your ada course and our Junior Java course at

	http://www.iosys.com/iooc

Question?  Why don't you compile the ada code using the intermetics
compiler which generates java byte codes and install the students
soluion on the web for them?

Subject: Re: Please Update Your Lovelace Copy!
Newsgroups: comp.lang.ada
References: &lt;5978f1$sd5@news.ida.org&gt;

In comp.lang.ada you write:

&gt;*LOTS* of people are copying Lovelace (my Ada tutorial)
&gt;onto their own systems and making them available to the web.
&gt;While there are some advantages to that, there
&gt;is a terrible disadvantage to it: updates aren't happening.

We have been using Lovelace (in the sence of making it availiable to our
students) for a year or so now.  However this is likely to become a much
greater use in the near future as our main stream teaching courses start
converting to Ada from February next year. 
Thank you for your efforts in producing this very useful teaching resource.

Our major reason for using a local copy is cost. It is quite prohibitive to
use a resource such as this over an international link. (Although in fact it
works very well over that link - the performance is such that students would
be likely to use it extensively at very high cost.)

&gt;PLEASE, either REMOVE your old copies of Lovelace or UPDATE them.
&gt;If you plan to update them, put yourself on the automatic
&gt;notification list for Lovelace changes and update your copy within 4 weeks
&gt;after a new version is posted.  If you can't commit to that, create
&gt;a hypertext link from your site to a master copy that WILL be maintained
&gt;and remove your old version.

I was not aware of the automatic notification list. This sounds very useful
in keeping up to date.  I realise that you do request local installers to
notify you when installing it and regret my impoliteness in not doing
so.  My best excuse is that I don't like to disturb obviously very 
productive people when there is no real reason.

Perhaps you might include some comment about the automatic notification
in the Lovelace tutorial. If its already there, my apologies, but I haven't
seen it - perhaps on the top of the page about version information would
be an appropriate place.

[ There is a note at the end of the tutorial (see "fini.htm"), but
 not in the download section.  I'll add links to
 automatic update information that in the next version from
 the "download", main menu, and version info.
 Of course, an even better approach is to buy my book;
 see the "orderbk.htm" file. ]


&gt;The current version of Lovelace is always accessible at:
&gt;  http://www.adahome.com/Tutorials/Lovelace/lovelace.htm
&gt;The current version of Lovelace is 5.6. "ez2load" and the PAL
&gt;generally try to keep updated versions as well.

We're currently at 5.5 so we're not too far behind, but I will update before
our students arrive at the end of February.  One comment here. We're always
reluctant to update software during semester, because of the potential for
disasters if something breaks.  Of course this is much less serious for
a tutorial than for a compiler and I am prepared to commit to your 4 week
update period.

[ Okay.  It's not like I'm going to file suit or anything.
 I just don't want people to send me bugs for things that have been fixed.
 How about keeping the old copy around, but by default pointing people
 to the latest version?
 If something breaks you can go back.

 As you noted, this is a lot less serious than a compiler. ]


One innovation which I really like in your more recent versions is the
WebAda facility.  However, this also has the potential to blow our
budget with communication costs.  I am attempting to install WebAda
locally in conjunction with Lovelace but having some difficulty. I got
the WebAda "compile" program got it compiled locally.  However, I have
not been able to get the program lovelace.adb which I believe is also
necessary to link Lovelace to WebAda.  (I have been in contact with
Doug Smith about this, and he has told me he will update the WebAda
distribution to include it, but as far as I know this has not yet
occurred. (but I haven't checked for a couple of days either.))
My other problem was that I was trying to call WebAda directly from
the Lovelace htm files, but it seems to treat it as text rather than
execute it.
Any hints on this would be appreciated. (We are using Netscape -I have
both version 2.02 and 3.01 available on Sun Solaris 2.5 (we have a
network of Sun sparcs))

I am trying to get it working on my machine before asking our systems
people to install it but it seems I may need to install a server on my
machine to do this.

For what its worth - one minor negative. I don't like those moving arrows
on the Lovelace home page - I find them distracting ( I guess I also
have fears about what their cost in resources is - which may be completely
unjustified, as I don't know anything about the technology used here.)

[ The arrows are supposed to be distracting, in the sense that they'll
  point you to the most important point.

  The resource cost is very small; I also keep track of resource costs.
  The arrow is a single GIF file, 2Kbytes long
  (the two arrows are the same image, so it's only loaded once).
  By comparison, the main Lovelace page is 6Kbytes, so the image is
  1/3 the size of the text. Once the 2Kbyte image is loaded into the
  local browser cache, it isn't loaded again until it leaves the cache
  (usually after quite some time), and no network resources are used to
  make the arrow move (other than the one-time file load cost). ]


Thanks again for your very useful tutorial,

I must thank you here from Austria in Europe, because here are not soo

very good tutorial to work.

I have here version 5.0, and I get them from an CD-ROM of Ada (February 
1996) of an Walnut Creek CDROM.

I'm very happy, that there are some people on the world like you to give 
us such an informative Tutorial, so I hope we see us in future in 
cyberspace or bether in programming Ada packages:-)

Dear David,

        I am going through your tutorial, And It is going quite well. But
since I have C / C++ experience I am not facing major problems.

        I have reached Chapter 13 (Tasking Issues) and am facing slight
problems with implementing Multi-tasking.  Since I am using the DOS
EZ2LOAD ADA95,  I do expect some problems.  I am running a DOS windows
under WIN 95.   I can compile the example and it runs however the tasks
are executed sequentially though.  I expected they would, could you let me
know how to set up my DOS/WIN95 environment for multitasking.

        I am also using the "Local" version of the tutorial that I
downloaded from the adahome website.  I have not faced any problems with
it since I also have a copy of the LRM.  Could you guide me to a better
language reference (easier to refer and perhaps with more examples than it)

David Wheeler,

I'm just dropping you a note to say that i'm using your program "Small" as
the basis of a MUD / MOO i'm coding for windows in Delphi (Pascal) -
because Pascal and Ada (and Modula 2) are so closely related, it's very
easy to convert, and the basics (your program) are clean, elegent and
expandable.

When (if?) it ever gets finished, i'll be sure to send you a copy of the
program / source and will make sure that you get a credit in any
documentation / online about commands.

Dave,

I am a student at Portsmouth university in England. I am studying Bsc Computer 
Science and am being taught ada as my first programming language.

I just wanted to complement you on this tutorial. Unfortunatly our lecturer here 
seems to think we already know about ada and just sets us task's with out 
explaining any of the key elements of the language. So we are left to read 
about them in books. Most of the books I have read have semi-confused me and I 
have not been very succesful. 

However after going through your Lovelace tutorial I feel much more confident 
about the language.

Well done and Thank you very much

Dear David A. Wheeler,

I've completed Lovelace. I confirm I've learned a good deal and that I've
enjoyed the process.

By the way, the reason for me to follow your tutorial was that at the
moment I am without job. A "potential employer" involved in space telecom
asked me about a supposed knowledge in Ada that I did not have. You give me
The Answer to my problem... Thank you. I feel ready for the next
conversation with this "potential employer".

You ask for comment and suggestions. Just one thing : I have had "html"
problems with the following chapters :
1-3, 6-3, 7-f, 8-3, 13-3, 16-f ;
and section 8-f contains a "Put" instead of "put" in the third paragraph,
making a sentence not clear.

Other comments can follow later, when I will have some professional
activities (at Project Leader level) related with Ada...

There are several tutorials listed at the Ada home page:

Lovelace is a popular one; there are a few others.

P.S. By the way, Ada is a woman, not an acronym.  When you capitalize her
name as you have done,  then some may think you want information about the
American Dental Association!

Hi, David.

You probably don't recall (it's been a year since we last
corresponded), but we're using your Small program in one of our 
courses here at AFIT.  

Last year I used GNAT and everything worked fine.  This year
we decided to move to Rational's Apex environment (which uses the
Verdix compiler).  This compiler doesn't like rooms.adb and complains
in the following way:

12:08:50 &gt;&gt;&gt; SOURCE.all.DESTINATIONS (DIR) := DESTINATION;
12:08:50 *** DESTINATION doesn't have the same type as SOURCE.all.DESTINATIONS 
         (DIR) [RM_95 5.2(4)]
12:08:50 &gt;&gt;&gt; ROOM_ACCESS (DESTINATION).all.DESTINATIONS (REVERSE_DIRECTION 
         (DIR)) := SOURCE;
12:08:50 *** SOURCE doesn't have the same type as ROOM_ACCESS 
         (DESTINATION).all.DESTINATIONS (REVERSE_DIRECTION (DIR)) [RM_95 5.2(4)]
 
I also tried compiling under the Object Ada (Alsys) compiler that
comes with the Felman/Koffman book and it also tags the type 
mismatch.

We're trying to figure out if this is a red herring and would
appreciate any insight you might have.  Have you attempted to compile
Small under any compilers other than GNAT?  Have there been some 
changes to small in this area since last year?  (I did check the
web site and the code appears to be the same.)

Thanks.
Mark

Subject: Section 4.1 - Type Integer

&gt;Unlike C or C++, but like Pascal and many other languages, Integers are not 
&gt;considered the same as True or False. A
&gt;zero and False aren't the same thing (in Ada terms they are different types).

You are right about C but in C++ 2 &lt; 3 has the value true which is of type 
bool and not int.

OTOH 2 &lt; 3 &lt; 4 is correct C++ and means (2 &lt; 3) &lt; 4 = true &lt; 4 = 1 &lt; 4 = 
true since true will be converted to 1 (but true isn't an integer).

Some compilers use the old C rules; at least g++ get it right.

[ In a narrow sense you're right, C++ says "2&lt;3" is of type "bool", but
as you point out this distinction is useless in C++ as a practical error-
prevention measure because C++ automatically promotes bool to int.  While
it's useful for documentation, it's not very helpful for error prevention.
C++ does this to maintain compatibility with C.  ]

I'm glad I ran across this tutorial on the internet, because it
presented the specifics of the language that I was looking for.  The
only language I knew, and knew well, was Fortran. Because I was so
comfortably using Fortran, I dreaded starting from scratch and learning
a new language, especially while learning OO design.  I had always heard
horrifying stories about Ada, and how complex it is.  It is complex, but
at least I am no longer fearful of it when I can write and run simple
programs in minutes.  I know I just have some basic Ada skills, but at
least I have started which is really the biggest step in learning any
new language, or tool.

Hello!

My name is Jonas Pettersson, a swdish student at Chalmers university of
Technology and the reason that I bumed into ADA is that I'm taking a
course in real-time-systems. I find ADA an easy language to get started
with still powerfull enaugh to grow with. I'm sure you know all about
that already, but iI would like to thank you for the Lovelaze tutorial,
with made understanding of som parts much easier, such as protected
objects etc.

Hello David A. Wheeler!

You wrote this in your ADA95 Lovelace tutorial:

&gt; You are free to copy and modify program Small as you see fit, and you can

&gt; use Small in any way you want, commercial or not. However, please give
&gt; me credit for writing the original if you do anything with Small ...

I would like to take the main routine of Small and add it with my comments
to my new German OOP Homepage. If you would like more information, feel
free to contact me.

I thank you for your good ADA tutorial!

----

MfG Andreas Hanzl

&gt; 
&gt; Thank you for your time

David, first congrats on getting the job. BTW you won't be Robinson
Crusoe in knowing little about the language. Most firms are set up to
teach you on the job out of neccessity.

Secondly, all you ever wanted to know is in http://www.adahome.com/

Thirdly, although if you go to the above URL it will answer all your
questions, here's some short answers to your specific questions anyway.

How does Ada compare with C?
- There's an article at the above site, on the equivalencies for Ada and
C - "Ada for C programmers"
If you read K&amp;R, in the preface it states that C is a relatively
low-level language. You're dealing with bytes, floats and so on, very
close to the way the machine operates, with few concessions to
expressing a solution to a problem in the real world. Ada is a
high-level language, where it's possible (even encouraged) not just to
distinguish between ints and floats, but between temperatures and
distances.

How should you prepare for it?
- Do the Lovelace on-line tutorial, available at http://www.adahome.com/
which is by far the best on-line tutorial for any language I've ever
seen.

Suggestions for books
- I like Barnes, "Programming in Ada" but there are many others, see the
URL for details.

Where can I get a Ada compiler and what platform can it exist on.
- http://www.adahome.com/ has several FREE Ada compilers. GNAT is
probably the best, it's "Industrial Strength", not just a learning
compiler. Platform - IBM compatible, MAC, Unix...

How many version of Ada is out there, price of compiler, etc.
- There's Ada-83 (the original) and Ada-95. Many of the OO concepts in
C++ are already in Ada-83, Ada-95 has the rest plus a lot more. As to
price of compiler, you can download a FREE one, or buy a CD from Walnut
Creek which has 1.3 GB of Ada material, including compilers, tutorials,
the language reference manual, etc etc etc available at
http://www.cdrom.com/ I believe. Cost plus shipping is under $45.

BTW it's Ada not ADA.

David,

I'm eagerly learning Ada and stumbled across your program small tutorial on
www.adahome.com -- a great idea, I might add.

On the page http://www.adahome.com/Tutorials/Lovelace/parsers.htm , the
following comment appears in the specification of package parser:

   -- Sets Quit to True if the user may run additional commands.

By my reading of the code, this comment should read:
   -- Sets Quit to True if the user may _not_ run additional commands.

Thanks for making your information public.

Scott

I just went through your "Lovelace" tutorial.  It all works
very nicely.  I must admit that I guessed some of the answers 
in the last couple of chapters ;-)

Really, I was interested in the answer to a particular question:
Does Ada95 support anything like virtual types of BETA? 

It does not seem to be easy to make a tagged type "virtual" in
the sense that one piece of syntax dynamically resolves to various
levels of specialization of a tagged type: My testing programs 
would always create an instance of the statically known type when 
I "new" an object, even if the type is tagged and a specialization
of the package which specializes that type is being "with"ed. 

Well, there are many things about Ada95 that I don't understand as
yet, but it is certainly an interesting language!


  best regards,

Mr Wheeler,

  Hi, my name is Matt and I use the Ada tutorial
you developed a lot and it is the best tutorial
I have found on the internet, not only for Ada,
but for any language.

  My question pretends to reading in an integer.
If I use 

int_io.get(num);

and they type in a string the DATA ERROR exception
is raised.  I know how to handle exceptions, but I
do not know, if it is even possible, to return to
the place you left off after an exception.

There are 2 possible solutions I have come up with.

1.  Handle the data error exception and some how 
return to the int_io.get(num) and ask the user
to enter in a number again.  (Which I do not know
how to do) or

2.  Get what the user typed in as string, determine
if the string is a valid number, and then convert
the string to an integer.  (Seems like the army way.)


I realize between your job and developing web pages and
trying to keep up with modern technology you must be
pretty busy.  I appreciate you taking the time to 
read this letter and I do not expect an immediate 
response due to the facts above.

Thx. in advance.

Matt Pezzuto

Sincere thanks to you for your timely information about the "Lovelace 
Tutorial".

I immediately ordered the book, and I look forward to studying it.  

As a recently "displaced worker" I hope to get myself moderately 
'up-to-speed' with Ada so that I might find work in some to the local 
defense companies here in the MPLS/St. Paul area.

Thanks again for your help.

Best regards,

Jim Kennedy

Dear David
   
  I have been using your Ada95 tutorial and I can't figure a way to code 
a "press any key to continue" procedure without having to press enter.
 Is there any command like C's getch or kbdhit? Also I can't figure out
how to import the following C function;

void key_pressed(void)
{

   printf(" press any key to continue");
   getch();
   return();
} 


I am enjoying learning Ada95 through your Lovelace tutorial but I
haven't
been able to figure out how to use unbuffered IO and also is there any
way to have control characters put into arrays or string? As control
characters in strings or files can be useful in some cases. I hope you
will find time to answer my questions.

                                       thanks for your time
                                       David Henrichsen

Why are there so many Johnsons in the phone book? They 
all have phones.

I am a budding young programming student, pardon, 
software engineer....  Anyway, I am in one of the last 
classes to use Ada as the core learning language and
your tutorial has served as a great tool to review concepts,
syntax rules, etc.

I read some of the comments from others regrading the 
ease of use of the tutorial (I believe one individual said it's
"too easy").  I have found it's easy enough to use yet 
contains enough "meat" to qualify as an excellent study
aid.  Keep up the good work.

P.S. Read your bio.  You know way too much....(ha, ha)

Dear David Wheeler,

I have completed your Lovelace tutorial, having found it very replete
and well thought out.  Since I will be using this language in the course
of my work, I am sure that what I have learned will be put to use.

I appreciate the effort which went into this.  I know from the way it
was written that it was a labor of love.

Sincerely,

Walt Dike

This is sort-of pointless banter; but I saw the second system as OO...

The cup is an abstract base class (sorry not sure if that is ada
terminology, there is a reson why I'm reading the tutorial you know! =) :
each type of soup is a child class from it, inheriting the stir()
functionality, and a shared storage mechanism.

Thinking the message passing big military system was a smokescreen, I
picked the second one. I'm not exactly sure why I emailed this, just sort
of laughing at myself.

Heh, yes definitely... =) I suppose I emailed you because it struck me as

I completed lovelace. It was very insightful. I don't actually intend to
program in ada, but rather to get some insights into how best to write
my own programing language.

You probably get hundreds of notes like this one, but I would like to
say thanks for the great Ada tutorial.  I have used your Lovelace
tutorial to review for an Ada final exam.  It was fantastic review!
Thanks again.

Dear Sir,
    I would like to thank you for putting the ada tutorial up in the web. It
helped me alot in my courses.
I was wandering that how can I write in ada to find "prime" numbers? maybe
you can help me in this? Thanx

Tony

Hi, I'm a second year electronics and software systems engineering
student at the university of Regina in Saskatchewan, Canada.  I am going
to be working with ada in the fall for a co-op work term, so I decided I
should learn it first.  I do have experience with Pascal, C, Fortran,
assembly language, etc...  your program was the right approach. 

After searching through the net, your website was the only one I found
that explained ada with an easy to understand approach.  After going
through the part of the first lesson, I immediately went to the springer
website and ordered the book.

Thanx

Mark Scantlebury

Mr. Wheeler,

Thank you very much for producing such a fine tutorial.  It took me
almost 2 weeks to finish, averaging about 45 minutes a day, but I did
it.  I can't thank you enough.  The fact that it was available on the
web at no cost really made me enjoy it even more.  As a recent aerospace
engineering graduate from the University of Central Florida, I was
anxious to learn something that wasn't taught at school (I have a
background in FORTRAN, C, and BASIC).  When I realized how widely used
Ada was in the defense industry, I have told all of my undergraduate
friends to learn such a versatile language.  And your Ada95 tutorial is
what I recommend to them.

Thanks again,

David:

I am a long-time user of Ada but only today took a peek at your famous 
Lovelace tutorial, although I have heard of it for about two years now.  
I've gone through the first three lessons and am very impressed with 
the quality of what you have done.

One relative minor correction is needed, though.  (Isn't is terrible 
that few people will take effort to send only positive feedback but 
instead wait until they have a problem with it?!?  Sorry, but I'm 
guilty, too, in general, although in this case, I started looking only 
today.)  In Section 3.3, you give "-7" as an example of an integer 
literal, when in fact there is no such thing as a negative numeric 
literal in Ada, with the "-" always being an operator; the BNF you 
provide in the section concurs.

Keep up the good work--in all areas of your life!

Dear David Wheeler,

	I really benefitted from the tutorial.  I found it using 
Yahoo.  As I went through the tutorial, I realized I actually met you in 
1995 when you visted Dr. Sutton's Engineering Seminar class.  

	My boss, Dr. Kent Haspert, has an office at IDA.  Small world, 
huh.  Thank you so much again.

David

absolutely fabulous web pages and just what I needed. 

I doubt that you have the time but if you do could you answer 3
incredibly basic questions that may be tripping others up too:

(1) which page that tells me how to actually run the compiled programs, 
(2) are the compiled versions able to be retrieved and stored locally on
my PC ? 

many thanks

I completed the tutorial.  I am an experienced programmer, but do not
feel prepared to write an original program yet.  But, I appreciate the
tutorial (and the fact that it is on-line) and I think it is just about
the right length.

Thank you,  Bill Wesen

Found the tutoral quite useful but then I'm a person 
who has taught Ada83 and only wanted a refresher to 
get the OO features of Ada95. Not so sure that one 
with no Ada exposure could cruise through it. The
tutoral starts simple but there are some leaps of 
faith one needs to get toward the end. For example,
it would help to make it clear that array indexing
uses the same notion of a range as was introduced 
in the for construct. Good job and thanks. - cpj

    I have not completed Lovelace, but I have browsed it. 
    It's good, with it, I begin to know the Ada language. I hope me can 
program with Ada, but I think it must be difficult for me.
But I want to master it, could you tell me how to do?

Your tutorial is very well done!!! Who knows I might buy the book form
if we use it on my next project...

Thanks for your effort. I love your approach; I like the "big" picture view
with examples. I hate sleeping through books which either assumed 
you don't know how to program or else simply present a list of
commands.

Spent last hour or so browsing itl. Looks like ADA is a
very nice language but don't have much info w/o having used it. So
far it looks very clean. Alot of concepts in the language give me the 
impression it was carefully designed. (I had feared it would be a messy
hack from what my cousin told me a number of years ago.)

I wonder if JAVA borrowed a bit from ADA; i.e, the packages. Was
execption handling always a feature in ADA? I know the C++ comments
and templates are based on ADA.

Dear Mr. Wheeler,

Lovelace is superb.  It makes learning easy, because you excel at writing,
and you know the best time to quiz your student.  If I had to answer
questions at the end of a chapter in a book, I probably would forget too
much before I had reached those questions.  But Lovelace gives me
information in pieces small enough for me.  You're helping me to divide
and conquer.  Thank you.

Btw, I'm a Christian, too.

Warm wishes,
Bill

Hello Mr. Wheeler!

Thank you for writing the Ada Lovelace Tutorial! :-D

I'm very new to the language (I programmed in BASIC, Pascal, Modula2,
Assembler, C and C++ up to now), but I'm very impressed and love Ada 95
very much! It's really fun to write programs in Ada - once you've
overcome the strong typing and the CONSTRAINT_ERRORs! ;-)

I'd never dared to write to such a person like you, so that you have to
use your valuable time answering my - perhaps - stupid questions. But
your comment that you're a Christian gave me the necessary courage,
because I'm one as well!

I have two questions so far:

I had to implement the game Connect Four as a project at university. I
had to make it as a multi-user programm and implement a knowledge base
so that the computer learns from every match he lost. So I had to use a
lot of file I/O stuff. But I have a problem: When I want to open a file
that has the necessary access rights, then I get an USE_ERROR. I don't
know why. At home it works very well and I have a EtherLAN network
between my two Acorn RiscPCs as well. I use RISC OS 3.70 and gnat 3.03
at home. At university I have to use SunOS 5.x and gnat 3.09. I found
out, that putting my program in /usr/local/open (our public directory)
solved my problem and no USE_ERROR occurs from there. If I put my
program in a sub-directory of my home-directory, give the directory
read, write and execute access and the program itself read and execute
access, then I get the USE_ERROR. Have I made an error in my source
code or is this a bug? Do I need to use the Form parameter when opening
files? Do I need to set it to "shared=yes"?

And my second question: Is there an Ada 95 Pretty Printer like the NASA
Ada Pretty Printer was for Ada 83? I compiled it and found it *very*
good, but the changes to make it work with Ada 95 are quite a lot! So
I'd like to know whether anybody has done this job already. I tried
PrettyAda and Formatter so far, but didn't find them as good as the
NAPP would have been, if it was designed for Ada 95 as well. Can you
give me any clue?

TIA!

Greetings,

Dear Mr.Wheeler,

I liked the web based Ada tutorials.I am a graduate 
student at George Mason Univ. Could you Include Linked
List package in the tutorial.  I would like to know
how to write the code for building,inserting ,deleting
etc in a Linked list using Ada.Or could you recommend me a good text
book for Ada .

Thanks
ramani

I found your ADA tutorial very useful.
It is well designed and its more enjoyable than reading many of
complicated books.
I am still reading the ADA notes of the Lovelace tutorial  and they are
helping me a lot while I am trying to learn the language.
The examples are somteimes easy but it makes you study more.
My favorite are the comparisons with C and Pascal between ADA.So you get
used to ADA easier.
-------------
Bye for now.

Dear Mr. Wheeler,

I just reched the end of the Lovelace tutorial. It has been great fun.
Thank you! Next I will continue looking at the "Small" program in
small.htm and trying to compile some files with GNAT. This was the first
time I studied ADA. Earlier I have been programming in various
Assemblers, Basic dialects, Algol 60, Fortan IV, VAX Fortran, a number
of Pascal variants including Borland Pascal with objects, C and Matlab
script.

Best Regards
Ove Delin

Hello Mr.David,

I went through the exhaustive tutorial on Ada done by 
you.I find it interesting and useful.I am doing my MS
in Information systems at George Mason Univ.
In my course work I have to give a paper comparing
Ada and C++. Could you please tell me some resources from where I
could get enough material on this subject.
I thought of taking this liberty to ask you for help
as you are a very experienced professional on object oriented languages.
Thanks
Ramani

I wanted to tell you that I completed your tutorial.  I did a quick skim
of the small code.  It took me two days.  In all, your tutorial is clear
an to the point.  I really like the comparisons to C++ and Java since
C++ is my mother tongue these days.

I will buy your book.  Keep up the excellent work!

Sincerely,
David Marceau

Mr. Wheeler,
I recently ran across the Ada95 CGI Package and I love it. It is so much
easier than Perl and allot less confusing for large projects. Thank you
for the wonderful contribution to the development community.

to write you a note. Here, it is.

Thankx for putting so much work in the tutorial. By now, I feel more
comfortable
using Ada.

David

I think your ADA online tute is a fantastic idea!  I am using it to =
review my knowledge of ADA from university days (and learn about the =
ADA95 standard).  I'm thinking about writing a medium sized application =
and want to use ADA.

I have two questions:

Is there a way to download it (or sections of it) so I do not need to be =
online to complete it?  My service provider charges an hourly rate...

Do you know of any packages that provide database capabilities for ADA?  =
I am currently familiar with relational databases (esp DB2, SQL based) =
but any packages that you know of, of any other kind, will save me some =
time.

Thanks
Mark

David,

I completed Lovelace!

It is really a great tool. I only wanted to have a quick look into the
features of ADA95 and didn't intend to go through a full tutorial.

But Lovelace is so good, it didn't allow me to leave before I had it
completed. I have done other web based tutorials and most of them were real
boring.
Congratulations.

Best regards,
  Frank

Here is my feedback:

I particularly appreciated your details about efficiency, and all the
comments explaining what things work like this while other things work
like that.
If I am not clear: you provide technical tutorial and explanations
beyond it which help
to understand deeper.

Thanks,

Vincent Tourvieille

Dear Mr.David A. Wheeler,

I've just finished reading your web Ada tutorial and as you suggest I'm =
sending you an e-mail to notify this.

Really, your suggestion is not the main reason to write you this e-mail. =
I'm emailing you to congratulate for your great job!.I'd like sincelely =
encourage you to continue this project.

I started reading Lovelace because I'm a computers student asked to =
start programing in Ada in few weeks. I found your tutorial through the =
Public Ada Library. The more I was reading the more I felt interested. =
It's obvious that I've found Lovelace a great tool to approach to Ada =
basics in a interactive and quite "amazing" way.

I'd like to send you a little suggestion, too. I'sure that I will return =
to Lovelace later to read again some section. I think that a topics =
index will be very useful to find the apropiate section (or setctions) =
related to a particular keyword or concept.

Many thanks for your job!
Yours sincerely:

Hello,

 I am a High School student trying to broaden my horizions, by learning a new
language, I found that this is an excellent tutorial, only I noticed your page
is covered in dead links anything based off the server lglwww.epfl.ch are
dead, if I am wrong please correct me because several of those links look
quite helpful.  Thank you for posting such a helpful tutorial.

David,

Just completed the tutorial, and wanted to say thanks. 

I'm a systems engineer who has been tasked to support the requirements
analysis for a fairly large test environment. When the first iteration of
that completed I was given the responsibility of leading a small group of
software engineers to prototype some of the critical functions of the
environment. Not being a software engineer, I felt inadequate to the task of
overseeing and critiquing the work of this group.

Your tutorial has at least given me the basics of the language, and along
with substantial support of the folks working for me, I've gained enough
knowledge to intelligently support design discussion.

Thanks again.

Tim Eno

I just completet your Ada tutorial and I found it very helpful!
Unfortunately, the link to WebAda doesn't work and I couldn't find an
alternative location of this compiler. Is there any?

Greetings from Poland!

I'm just writing to tell you that I have completed the tutorial, and
liked it very much. I had to learn ADA quickly and it was a very good
way to teach me the basics. I'm already an experienced C/C++ programmer,
so I didn't have any problems understanding the contents; don't know
about a 'fresh' person though. Anyway, I think it is a piece of a very
good work.
One more thing, about the way I found the tutorial (in case you are
interested): I found it on something called "The Brighton University
Resource Kit for Students", 3rd edition [August 1998].

Thank you

Lukasz Gwozdz

Hello.  I recently completed your lovelace tutorial.  Thank you for 
making the information available for free.  This was an introduction 
to Ada programming for me, and I learned quite a bit.  Thanks again.

Hi David!

   I wanted to drop you a note and tell you how much I enjoyed your
Lovelace tutorial.  As a software developer involved in writing safety
critical applications, Ada is quickly becoming the language most
chosen for real time controls.  I was able to quickly come up to speed
and gain a better understanding (and appreciation) for what Ada 95 offers.
Thanks for a great tutorial!

Some comments:

About the only thing I find lacking in the tutorial (and not just yours,
to be honest!) is a discussion of what features of Ada are performed
at compile time versus at run time.  In the work that I do, we need to
meet DO-178B standards for critical software.  Given that, we need to
test every path in the software, including any embedded runtime.
Since we generally have no access to run time source, we do not
include a run time system (or we internally write a very stripped down
version to get the software up and running).  We're often faced with the
dilemma of trying to figure out exactly what kind of runtime we need.
Surprisingly, this information generally isn't documented very well
(or at all!) with some Ada compilers.

Are you aware of any sources of information in this area?  I would
be very eager to see ANY discussion of this topic.  Thanks!

Regards,

  Sean Wall
