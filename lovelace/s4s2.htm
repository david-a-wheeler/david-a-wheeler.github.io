Let's see how to declare a subprogram (procedure or function) declaration.
The main difference between a procedure and function is that a function
returns a value, while a procedure does not (though a procedure
can change the values of parameters sent to it).
Here's an example of a procedure declaration for a procedure named Average,
which takes as input two values (called A and B)
and changes a third variable (called Result, presumably to hold the average):
<P>
<PRE>
procedure Average(A, B : in Integer; Result : out Integer);
</PRE>
<P>
Actually, a subprogram that averages two numbers would probably be defined
as a function. Here's a declaration of a function which takes as input
two values and returns a result:
<P>
<PRE>
function Average_Two(A, B : in Integer) return Integer;
</PRE>
<P>
Note the keywords `in' and `out';
this indicates the <EM>mode</EM> of the parameter.
There are three possible modes:
<OL>
<LI>
`in' - the parameter's value may be used but not changed.
<LI>
`out' - the parameter's value may be changed but not used.
<LI>
`in out' - the parameter's value may be used and/or changed.
</OL>
<P>
The default mode is `in', but I recommend that you always state
the desired mode.
<P>
Here's a <A HREF="bnf.htm">BNF</A> for subprogram declarations:
<P>
<PRE>
subprogram_declaration ::= subprogram_specification ";"

subprogram_specification ::= "procedure" procedure_name parameter_profile | 
                 "function" procedure_name parameter_profile "return" type

parameter_profile ::= [ "(" parameter_specification
                            { ";" parameter_specification} ")" ]

parameter_specification ::= parameter_name_list ":" mode type
                            [ ":=" default_expression ]

mode ::= [ "in" ] | "out" | "in" "out"

parameter_name_list ::= identifier { "," identifier }

procedure_name ::= identifier
</PRE>
