Ada also predefines a simple type called <EM>Boolean</EM>,
which can only have two values, <EM>True</EM> and <EM>False</EM>.
All of the comparison operations (=, &gt;=, /=, etc.) have result
values of type Boolean.
All conditions (such as what goes after an <EM>if</EM> and <EM>while</EM>)
must be of type Boolean.
<P>
There are a few special infix operations that take two Booleans and
result in a Boolean: "and", "or", and "xor" (exclusive-or),
with their usual meanings.
The value of `True and False' is False, while the value of `True or False'
is True.
`Exclusive or' is true if either of two conditions, but not both, is true.
<P>
There is also the prefix operation ``not''.
If a boolean variable A has the value True, `not A' has the value False.
<P>
Although you can probably guess what the values of any combination
of values is, here they are officially:
<PRE>
--- When ---+------------------- Then -----------------
A     B     | (A and B)   (A or B)   (A xor B)  (not A)
True  True  |   True        True       False     False
True  False |   False       True       True      False
False True  |   False       True       True      True
False False |   False       False      False     True
</PRE>
<P>
Normally Ada will evaluate these
expressions in whatever order is most efficient for the machine.
If it's important to evaluate them in a certain order
and to stop evaluating them when the answer is known, there are
versions of `and' and `or' that are called `short-circuit operations'.
These operations
will execute strictly left-to-right and will not execute anything
if they don't have to.
C's &amp;&amp; and || operations work this way.
The short-circuit version of `and' is `and then'; the short-circuit
version of `or' is `or else'. For example, if
you want to do something if K isn't zero and
1.0/K is more than B, but you realize that the latter test <EM>must</EM>
be done after the former:
<P>
<PRE>
 if K /= 0 and then 1.0/Float(K) &gt; B then ...
</PRE>
