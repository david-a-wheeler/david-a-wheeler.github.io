Inside a subprogram body, between the "is" and the "end &lt;name&gt;", is a
sequence_of_statements.
A sequence_of_statements is simply - well - a sequence of statements,
each terminated with a semicolon.
There are many different kinds of statements; we've already seen assignment
statements and procedure call statements.
We'll now examine a few other kinds of statements, starting with the
<EM>if statement</EM>.
<P>
If statements determine if some condition is true, and then execute some
sequence of statements depending on that determination.
Here's a trivial example that determines if A is equal to B; if it is,
A receives the value of B plus one. If A isn't equal to B, A receives the
value of B minus one:
<P>
<PRE>
 if A = B then
    A := B + 1;
 else
    A := B - 1;
 end if;
</PRE>
<P>
Here's the full <A HREF="bnf.htm">BNF</A> for the if statement:
<PRE>
if_statement ::=
  "if" condition "then"
     sequence_of_statements
  {"elsif" condition "then"
     sequence_of_statements}
  ["else" 
     sequence_of_statements]
  "end if;"
</PRE>
<P>
Like other algorithmic languages, if `condition' is true the
`then' part is executed.
Otherwise, the elsif clauses (if any) are checked in first-to-last order,
again looking for a true condition.
Finally, if none of the conditions are true, the `else' clause is executed
(if there's an "else" clause).
<P>
Notice that the keyword "then" is mandatory (it doesn't exist in C or C++).

What is the final value of A in the following sequence of statements?
<PRE>
 A := 5;
 B := 6;
 if A &gt; B then
  A := 7;
 else
  A := A - 2;
 end if;
