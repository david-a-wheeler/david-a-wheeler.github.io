<H1>Java and Ada</H1>
<P>
Sun's Java technology has become a "hot" topic. Java makes it possible for
users to run programs just by browsing the World Wide Web (WWW). Using Java,
WWW users can use sophisticated user interfaces and handle arbitrary data
formats (the data and the program to handle the data can be sent together!).
Java can also be used to distribute computer platform independent software
(i.e. the same software would run on an IBM-compatible PC, Apple Macintosh,
and arbitrary Unix machine).
<P>

It turns out that Java programs can be created using Ada.
An Ada language compiler can be used to generate Java "class" files,
just like a Java language compiler does.
Users can then run these "class" files using their
implementation of the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) -
and Netscape's Navigator is one of those implementations.
Ada and Java components can even freely call each other.
<P>
The Lovelace tutorial (a tutorial on the Ada 95 programming
language) includes several sections on how to create
Java programs using the Ada 95 programming language.
It also includes some small examples and references to
other material.
<P>
If you're interested in reading those sections, take a look at the
<A HREF="lesson16.htm">outline of lesson 16</A>.
You can even jump to the first section on Java, which is currently
<A HREF="s16s4.htm">section 16.4</A>.
Warning: do <B>not</B> create hypertext links to an individual section,
since section
numbers change over time. Instead, create links (such as bookmarks)
to this page instead.
These sections assume that you already know some Ada; if you don't,
you can
<A HREF="s1s1.htm">start from the beginning of the Lovelace tutorial</A>
and learn Ada.
<P>
Lovelace includes two sample Java programs in Ada:
<OL>
<LI>Hello (you can
<A HREF="hello.htm">run it</A> or see its
<A HREF="hello.ada">source code</A>).
<LI>Doodle (you can
<A HREF="doodle.htm">run it</A> or see its
<A HREF="doodle.ada">source code</A>).
</OL>

More specific details of the correspondence between Java and
Ada, including information on constructors, is described in a paper by
