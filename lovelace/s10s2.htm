Before you can raise or handle an exception, it must be declared.
Declaring exceptions is just like declaring a variable of
type <EM>exception</EM>; here's an example:
<P>
<PRE>
  Singularity : exception;
</PRE>
<P>
To be complete, here's the syntax
for defining an exception, describing using
<A HREF="bnf.htm">BNF</A>:
<P>
<PRE>
  exception_declaration ::= defining_identifier_list ": exception;"
  defining_identifier_list ::= identifier { "," identifier }
</PRE>
<P>
Exception declarations are generally placed in a package declaration.
<P>
Raising an exception is easy, too - just use the <EM>raise</EM>
statement.
A raise statement is simply the keyword "raise" followed by the name
of the exception.
For example, to raise the "Singularity" exception defined above, just say:
<P>
<PRE>
  raise Singularity;
</PRE>
<P>
The syntax in <A HREF="bnf.htm">BNF</A> is:
<P>
<PRE>
  raise_statement ::= "raise" [ exception_name ] ";"
</PRE>
<P>
You'll notice that the exception_name is optional; we'll discuss
what that means in the next section.
