The following are email comments about Lovelace.
If you're curious what other people are saying about Lovelace,
here's your answer.
I've shortened these messages, in particular I've:
<UL>
<LI>
removed all specific
comments on errors (since I've fixed them),
<LI>
removed extraneous mail headers (which aren't interesting), and
<LI>
omitted names (or entire messages) if I was requested to do so.
</UL>
<P>
I've also added a few comments from me, enclosed in brackets [], where
I thought it would be appropriate.
These comments are in the order I received them.
Enjoy.
