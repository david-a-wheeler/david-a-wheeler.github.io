Sometimes a literal of a single character is needed.
A single character is represented using by enclosing it in single
quotes ('). For example, 'a' represents the lower case letter A.
This is true even if it's a single quote character, so <TT>'''</TT>
represents a single quote character.
<P>
Strings are enclosed in double quote characters (").
To include a double quote character in a string, type it twice ("")
inside the larger string.
Thus "Hello" is a string, as is "She said, ""How are you?""".
An empty string is simply written as "".
<P>
We'll find out later how to represent control characters, but
for now we'll note that C-like escape characters do <EM>not</EM> work.
You can do the same thing in Ada but in a different way, and because of
the way Ada works they aren't used as often.
