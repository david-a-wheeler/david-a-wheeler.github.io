Installation Instructions for the WWW version
(this is intended for Magnus Kempe):

Note - I've added a "mklinks" command to create the ".html"
files since they're now all ".htm" files.

You should have received a file called WWW_LOVELACE.tar;
these instructions assume a Unix system.

1. Create a new subdirectory called "lovelace.new",
   and move into that subdirectory.
       mkdir lovelace.new ; cd lovelace.new
2. Move LOVELACE.tar (using mv) into this directory.
3. Untar it, using:
   tar xvf LOVELACE.tar
3a Create the symbolic links for the dashed filenames using
    mklinks2
   Then Create the ".html" symbolic links using mklinks:
    mklinks
   The order is important: mklinks2, then mklinks
3b Expand the Java classes for the Ada applets using
   tar xvf adaclass.tar
4. You _may_ need to reset file access permissions.  I'd use:
   chmod a=r *
5. Try out the HTML files using your favorite WWW viewer
   (Mosaic, netscape, etc).
6. Copy the zip & gzip files to the ftp areas:
     cp *.zip *.gz  WHEREVER_ELSE_THEY_GO
   WHEREVER_ELSE_THEY_GO should include ftp://lglftp.epfl.ch/pub/Ada/HTML/
7. Once you're happy, rename directories so this becomes the official one:
   cd ..
   mv lovelace lovelace.old ;  mv lovelace.new lovelace
8. When everything seems to work correctly, remove the tar file:
   rm WWW_LOVELACE.tar
