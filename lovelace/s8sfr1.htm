At this point you've done a lot of reading on-line, and you
have a good idea on how Lovelace is organized.
You're welcome to continue to use the on-line version, but I recommend
<A HREF="book.htm"><B>buying the book instead</B></A>.
There's enough material left that it'd be faster to use the book version
than the on-line version, and if you've made it this far
you'll probably continue the rest of the way.
So, if you'd like to buy the book,
<A HREF="book.htm"><B>more information about the book form
of this tutorial is available</B></A>.
