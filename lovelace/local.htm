<H1>Local Version of Lovelace: An Ada Tutor</H1>

Welcome to the local version of Lovelace, an Ada tutorial!
This tutorial will explain the basics of the Ada programming language.
<P>
It's important to understand that you are looking a
<EM>local</EM> version of Lovelace.
That means that you can use this version of the Lovelace tutorial
without a connection to the Internet (and even without a modem).
<P>
Having a local version of a tutorial implies some limitations:
<OL>
<LI>
This tutorial will occasionally refer you to other resources
outside this tutorial.
Attempting to follow such references will fail
unless you have a working connection to the Internet.
<LI>
You are probably using an older and less complete
version of the tutorial.
The best way to always use the latest version is to
use Lovelace directly through the World Wide Web (WWW).
