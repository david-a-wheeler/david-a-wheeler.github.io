Right.
It's easier to say this than to do it, of course, and sometimes
there simply isn't a (known) better way.
In that case, judicious use of these other techniques can usually improve
performance with little cost and significant results.
The best results are obtained with a combination of all of these
techniques - good algorithms, compiler optimizations,
various hints to the compiler (like pragma Inline), and suppressing
selected checks (using pragma Suppress) where it's known that
problems can't occur.
