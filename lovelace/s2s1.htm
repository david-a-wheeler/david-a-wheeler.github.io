Now that we have very brief flavor of what Ada code looks like, we
need to define some key terms.
<P>
More formally, an Ada program is composed of one or more <EM>program units</EM>.
A program unit can be a:
<OL>
<LI>
<EM>subprogram</EM>, which define executable algorithms.
Procedures and functions are both subprograms.
<LI>
<EM>package</EM>, which defines a collection of entities.
Packages are the main grouping mechanism in Ada, somewhat analogous
to Modula's "module".
<LI>
<EM>task unit</EM>, which defines a computation that can occur in
parallel with other computations.
<LI>
<EM>protected unit</EM>, which can coordinate data sharing
between parallel computation.  This did not exist in Ada 83.
<LI>
<EM>generic units</EM>, which helps to make reusable components
(C++'s templates are similar).
</OL>
<P>
The latter three are advanced topics, so we will concentrate for
now on packages and subprograms.
<P>
The <EM>package</EM> is structurally the most important kind of program unit.
Most Ada programs are basically a set of a large number of packages, with
one procedure used as the ``main'' procedure to start the Ada program.

In section 1-1 we defined a simple procedure called Hello.
What kind of program unit was procedure Hello?
