That's right; that's in the private part of the package.
This is important to note - even when something is implemented using
access types, that doesn't mean that everyone needs to see how stacks
are implemented.
In this example, customers can push and pop values on a stack without
knowing how access values work.
<P>
Note that this version of Generic_Stack is composable.
Since this version supports assignment (:=) and equality (=), we can
create stacks of stacks.
Even if you never create a stack of stacks, checking to see if a
reusable component is composable is a good way to check on the
generality of a resuable component
