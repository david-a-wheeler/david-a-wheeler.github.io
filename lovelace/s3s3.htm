A number that is included in a program's source code
is called a ``numeric literal''.
There are two kinds of numeric literals: real literals and integer literals.
A real literal includes a point (``.''), while an integer literal does not.
Sample integer literals include ``2'' and ``400''.
<!-- Removed "-7" from above list of integer literals -->
Sample real literals include ``2.0'', ``400.0'', and ``3.14159''.
<P>
Traditional exponent operators (such as 1.0E9) are permitted in
numeric literals.
Exponents are even allowed for integer literals, though for integer
literals the exponent must not be negative.
<P>
To make long numbers easier to read, underscores are permitted inside
a numeric literal. For example, "1_000_000" is legal.
This is similar to the way commas are used in the United States and periods
are used in Europe.
Underscores aren't allowed to be consecutive,
numbers may not end in an underscore, and underscores don't
change the value of a number.
<P>
A useful Ada capability is its ability to write out literals in
other bases from 2 to 16 (C has this capability to a lessor extent as well).
These are called, reasonably enough, <EM>based literals</EM>.
To create a based literal, write out the desired base,
a "#" sign, the number in the requested base, and another "#" sign.
For example, "2#1001_1000#" is a base 2 number equal to 128+16+8 = 152.
<P>
For completeness, here's the <A HREF="bnf.htm">BNF</A> of numeric literals:
<P>
<EM>
numeric_literal ::= decimal_literal | based_literal
<BR>
decimal_literal ::= numeral [ . numeral ] [ exponent ]
<BR>
numeral ::= digit { digit | "_" }
<BR>
exponent ::= "E" [ "+" | "-" ] numeral
<BR>
based_literal ::= base "#" based_numeral "#" [ exponent ]
<BR>
base ::= numeral
<BR>
based_numeral ::= extended_digit { extended_digit | "_" }
<BR>
extended_digit ::= digit | "A" | "B" | "C" | "D" | "E" | "F"
</EM>

<P>
Here are two lists of numbers:
<OL>
<LI> 5.5, 200_000.12, 2#1000_0100#, 8#123#
<LI> 60, 12, 0x50
</OL>
<P>
Which of those lists has only legal numeric literals?
<OL>
<LI><A HREF="s3s3r1.htm">List number 1.</A>
<LI><A HREF="s3s3r2.htm">List number 2.</A>
</OL>
