Let's briefly review what we've learned so far:
<OL>
<LI>
Logically, Ada programs are composed of a set of <EM>program units</EM>.
<LI>
There are different kinds of program units; the ones we've concentrated
on are <EM>subprograms</EM> and <EM>packages</EM>.
<LI>
Subprograms define processing algorithms.
Subprograms can be <EM>procedures</EM> or <EM>functions</EM>.
<LI>
<EM>Packages</EM> are the main Ada structuring tool used to group
things together.
<LI>
In general, a program unit has two parts, a <EM>declaration</EM>
and a <EM>body</EM>.
Sometimes a declaration is also called a <EM>specification</EM>.
<LI>
Ada compilers compile <EM>compilation units</EM>.
A compilation unit is either a program unit's declaration or body,
preceded by a <EM>context clause</EM>.
<LI>
A <EM>context clause</EM> is a set of <EM>with clauses</EM>
(that state what other program units are needed) and/or
<EM>use clauses</EM> (the program units to search by default).

<P>
Given what you know now, is it possible for an Ada compiler to
compile a package declaration (when preceded by the appropriate
context clauses), even if implementation details are needed and
the package body has not been developed yet?
