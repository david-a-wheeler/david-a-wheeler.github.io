Ada95: The Lovelace Tutorial

Abstract: "Ada95: The Lovelace Tutorial" provides an introduction
to one of the most widely used programming languages in the world.
Although the reader is assumed to have a basic understanding of programming,
no prior exposure to Ada is assumed and all the basics of the language
are covered.  Each section covers a key concept, and most sections include
a test question to check the reader's understanding of the concept.
Each set of sections concludes with additional questions to help ensure
that the reader has grasped the material.

 All essential features of Ada95 are covered including its object-oriented
features, tasking, generics, and exception handling. One chapter specifically
addresses how to interface with other programming languages, particularly
C and Java, and shows by example how to create a Java applet in Ada95.
As a result, both students and professional programmers learning Ada
will welcome this new text.
