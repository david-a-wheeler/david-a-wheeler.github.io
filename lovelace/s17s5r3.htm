No, not quite, though the distinction is subtle.
It's true that the <EM>result</EM> of the inspection process is a fixed product.
However, fixing defects is considered the author's job; the inspectors do
not try to figure out how to <EM>fix</EM> a given problem.
You might say I'm really quibbling on this point, but there are serious
problems with letting the inspectors try to fix the defects:
<P>
<OL>
<LI>When a group tries to "fix" the problem it may focus on an obvious
but not-quite-correct solution; solving problems is best left to the
careful consideration of the original author.
<LI>If time is spent trying to fix problems, there won't be time left
to find defects in the first place.
</OL>
<P>
If the inspectors have something to contribute to help fix the problem,
it should be brought up during the "third hour" or after the main meeting
as email or in a one-on-one session with the author.
