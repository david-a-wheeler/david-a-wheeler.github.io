Types can be a complex collection of other types;
the primary method for collecting these is through the <EM>record</EM>
(which is basically identical to the Pascal record and C struct).
For example, here's an example of a record useful for recording dates:
<P>
<PRE>
 type Date is
  record
   Day   : Integer range 1 .. 31;
   Month : Integer range 1 .. 12;
   Year  : Integer range 1 .. 4000 := 1995;
  end record;
</PRE>
<P>
The record component `Year' has an example of an `initialization clause' -
any object created with this type automatically has initial values
given in initialization clauses.
<P>
Creating variables of a record type is done the same way as any other
type.
A record component is referenced by using the variable name, a period,
and the name of the record component.
For example, let's create a variable called Ada_Birthday, and set
its values to December 10, 1815:
<P>
<PRE>
 procedure Demo_Date is
   Ada_Birthday : Date;
 begin
   Ada_Birthday.Month := 12;
   Ada_Birthday.Day   := 10;
   Ada_Birthday.Year  := 1815;
 end Demo_Date;
</PRE>

<P>
If you had the following record type:
<P>
<PRE>
 type Complex is
  record
    Real_Part, Imaginary_Part : Float := 0.0;
  end record;
</PRE>
<P>
and you declared the following type:
<P>
<PRE>
  X : Complex;
</PRE>
<P>
How would you set X's Real_Part to 1?

<OL>
<LI><A HREF="s6s6r1.htm">Complex.X.Real_Part := 1.0;</A>
<LI><A HREF="s6s6r2.htm">X.Real_Part := 1.0;</A>
<LI><A HREF="s6s6r3.htm">Real_Part.X := 1.0;</A>
</OL>
