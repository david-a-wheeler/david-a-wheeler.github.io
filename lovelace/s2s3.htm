The package is Ada's basic unit for defining a collection of logically
related entities.
For example, a package can be used to define a set of type declarations
and their associated operations.
<P>
For example, all Ada compilers provide a package called <EM>Text_IO</EM>.
Here's a highly simplified version of the package declaration of the
package Text_IO
(the lengthy complete definition is
<A HREF="http://www.adahome.com/rm95/rm9x-toc-A-10.html">part
of the RM's appendix A</A>):
<P>
<PRE>
package Text_IO is
  type File_Type is limited private;
  type File_Mode is (In_File, Out_File, Append_File);
  procedure Create (File : in out File_Type;
                    Mode : in File_Mode := Out_File;
                    Name : in String := "");
  procedure Close (File : in out File_Type);
  procedure Put_Line (File : in File_Type; Item : in String);
  procedure Put_Line (Item : in String);
end Text_IO;  
</PRE>
<P>
The package declaration of package Text_IO defines
a type called `File_Type' that represents an
opened or created file. The phrase `limited private' means that there
are no predefined operations on this type (more about that later).
<P>
Package Text_IO also defines a type called `File_Mode'; values of this type
can only have one of three values (this is how enumeration types are defined
in Ada).
<P>
The type definitions are followed by a set of subprograms that can accept
values of type File_Type. Note that procedures (subprograms) can be
contained inside packages.
Procedure `Create' lets you create files with given names;
procedure `Close' closes a file.
<P>
There are two procedures named `Put_Line' which write text out,
but they differ
in the arguments they can accept. The first takes a file and the
string to be output, while the other just takes the string to be output.
<P>
If a package declaration includes other declarations inside it
then there must be a package body somewhere that includes the bodies of
the items declared.
This simplified package declaration for Text_IO
has procedure declarations, so somewhere else
there must be a package body for Text_IO.

<P>
In this simplified package declaration for package Text_IO,
how many subprograms have been defined that explicitly require a
File_Type parameter?
