Ada has a number of `looping constructs' for situations where something
must repeat over and over again.
The simplest looping construct just repeats `forever'.
A simple loop simply begins with the phrase ``loop'', has statements to repeat,
and ends with ``end loop;''.  Here's an example of a procedure body
that, when run, repeatedly prints the same message over and over again:
<P>

<!-- Form to permit compilation using WebAda removed. -->
<P>
<PRE>
with Text_IO; use Text_IO;
procedure Forever is
begin
 loop
  Put_Line("Hello again!");
 end loop;
end Forever;
</PRE>
<P>

A loop can be terminated through an ``exit'' or an ``exit when'' clause
(similar to C's break statement).
An `exit' causes an immediate exiting of the innermost loop.
An `exit when' clause causes exiting of the innermost loop only if the
following condition is true.
<P>
The `exit when' clause is particularly useful in circumstances
where you must do some action(s)
before you can figure out if the loop has to stop or not.
These are called ``loop-and-a-half'' constructs - you start with "loop",
perform calculations to determine if the loop should stop, use an `exit when'
to exit on that condition, and then work on the result.
<P>
Here's an example of a loop-and-a-half.
This program reads in a list of numbers and prints out
their squares, but stops (without printing) when it reads in the number `0':

<!-- Form to permit compilation using WebAda removed. -->
<P>
<PRE>
with Text_IO, Ada.Integer_Text_IO;
use  Text_IO, Ada.Integer_Text_IO;
procedure Print_Squares is
 X : Integer;
begin
 loop
  Get(X);
 exit when X = 0;
  Put(X * X);
  New_Line;
 end loop;
end Print_Squares;
</PRE>
