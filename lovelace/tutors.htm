There are many ways to learn Ada.
<P>
Here are some on-line Ada tutorials expressly designed for self-study:

<LI>
<A NAME="lovelace"></A>
<A HREF="http://www.adahome.com/Tutorials/Lovelace/lovelace.html">Lovelace</A>
is a free (no charge) self-directed Ada 95 tutorial
available on the World Wide Web (WWW).
Lovelace assumes that the user already knows some other algorithmic
programming language (such as C, C++, or Pascal).
Lovelace is interactive; it contains a number of short sections, and most
short sections end with a question (to help ensure that you've understood
the section's material).
Lovelace can be used directly from the WWW,
<A HREF="http://www.adahome.com/Tutorials/Lovelace/download.html">downloaded</A>,
or run from <A HREF="http://ftp.cdrom.com/titles/ada.html">CD-ROM</A>.
Lovelace was developed by David A. Wheeler.

<LI>
<A NAME="law"></A>
<A HREF="http://www.scism.sbu.ac.uk/law/lawhp.html">Learn Ada on the Web (LAW)</A>
by Dr. Fintan Culwin was developed to freely
provide Ada training on the World Wide Web.
LAW is concerned with initial software development education rather
than with helping programmers who already know other computer languages.
Also, LAW is concerned as much
with providing software engineering tools over the Web as with presenting
information regarding Ada.
Dr. Culwin believes that the Lovelace and LAW projects
are complementary rather than needless duplication of each other, since
their target users are so different.
<P>
LAW includes an interesting capability to interactively create Ada
programs remotely over the Web; you might want to use this LAW
capability even if you choose to use another tutorial.
<P>
Dr. Culwin is at South Bank University, London, and may be contacted at
<A HREF="mailto:fintan@vax.sbu.ac.uk">fintan@vax.sbu.ac.uk</A>.

The
<A HREF="http://www.adahome.com/Ammo/Cplpl2Ada.html">C/C++
Programmers Ada Tutorial</A>
is a short hypertext tutorial for
programmers who have a C or C++ style programming language background.
It was written by Simon Johnson, with some additional text by Tucker Taft.

<A NAME="adatutr"></A>
<A HREF="http://members.aol.com/AdaTutor/sit.htm">Ada-Tutr</A> is
a shareware interactive Ada tutor developed by
<A HREF="mailto:johnherro@aol.com">John Herro</A> of
Software Innovations Technology.
You can download it from the
<A HREF="http://members.aol.com/AdaTutor/sit.htm">Ada-Tutr web site</A>, the
<A HREF="ftp://members.aol.com/AdaTutor/sit.htm">Ada-Tutr ftp site</A>
(ftp://members.aol.com/AdaTutor/).
You can download it by calling the
SaddleBag BBS, 1-407-773-0831, and log in with
the name Ada Tutor and the password tutor.
The
<A HREF="http://wuarchive.wustl.edu/languages/ada/crsware/a9xtutor/">Public
Ada Library's copy of Ada-Tutr</A> 
(<A HREF="http://www.cdrom.com/pub/languages/ada/crsware/a9xtutor/">mirror</A>)
is another way to retrieve Ada-Tutr.
There is also
<A HREF="http://wuarchive.wustl.edu/languages/ada/crsware/adatutor/">an
older version of Ada-Tutr for Ada 83</A>
(<A HREF="http://www.cdrom.com/pub/languages/ada/crsware/adatutor/">mirror</A>).
AdaTutr has a number of exercises that give a more complete understanding
of Ada but will take more time to complete than a tutor without such exercises
(such as
<A HREF="http://www.adahome.com/Tutorials/Lovelace/lovelace.html">Lovelace</A>).

<A HREF="http://wuarchive.wustl.edu/languages/ada/crsware/intada95/intada95.zip">Introducing Ada95</A>
is a set of slides about Ada 95 by
<A HREF="mailto: conn@wuarchive.wustl.edu">Richard Conn</A>.
Here's a quote from Richard Conn:<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
In the spirit of freely supporting the Ada community, I have
released the following course.  There is no restriction whatsoever
on its use and distribution (unlike other courseware and items).<P>
This is a day-long short course that introduces Ada95.  The purpose of
the course is to explore the Ada95 language, including its facilities
for object-oriented design and programming, real-time programming,
distributed processing, and other domains.  The course will concentrate
on the practical aspects of applying the features of Ada95 to the
software development process. Numerous examples of the language are
presented.<P>
