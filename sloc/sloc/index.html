The papers you can get from
this web site present source code size estimates (and their implications)
of a GNU/Linux distribution.

<p>
My latest size-estimation paper is
<a href="redhat71-v1/redhat71sloc.html"><i>
More than a Gigabuck: Estimating GNU/Linux's Size</i></a>
(June 2001).
Here are a few interesting facts quoting from the paper
(which measures Red Hat Linux 7.1):
<ol>
<li>
It would cost <b>over $1 billion (a Gigabuck)
to develop this Linux distribution by conventional proprietary means</b>
in the U.S. (in year 2000 U.S. dollars).
<li>It includes <b>over 30 million physical source lines of code (SLOC)</b>.
<li>It would have required about <b>8,000 person-years</b> of
development time.
<li>Red Hat Linux 7.1 represents over a <b>60% increase in
size, effort, and traditional development costs</b> over Red Hat Linux 6.2
(which was released about one year earlier).
</ol>
<p>
Many other interesting statistics emerge; here are a few:
<ul>
<li>
The largest components (in order) were the
Linux kernel (including device drivers), Mozilla
(Netscape's open source web system including a web browser,
email client, and HTML editor),
the X window system (the infrastructure for the graphical user interface),
gcc (a compilation system),
gdb (for debugging),
basic binary tools,
emacs (a text editor and far more),
LAPACK (a large Fortran library for numerical linear algebra),
the Gimp (a bitmapped graphics editor), and
MySQL (a relational database system).
<br>
<br>
<li>
The languages used, sorted by the most lines of code, were
C (71% - was 81%), C++ (15% - was 8%),
shell (including ksh),
Lisp, assembly, Perl, Fortran, Python, tcl, Java,
yacc/bison, expect, lex/flex, awk, Objective-C, Ada, C shell,
Pascal, and sed.
<br>
<br>
<li>
The predominant software license is the GNU GPL.
Slightly over half of the software is simply licensed using the GPL,
and the software packages using the copylefting licenses (the GPL and LGPL),
at least in part or as an alternative, accounted for 63% of the code.
In all ways, the copylefting licenses (GPL and LGPL) are the dominant licenses
in this Linux distribution.
In contrast, only 0.2% of the software is public domain.
</ul>
