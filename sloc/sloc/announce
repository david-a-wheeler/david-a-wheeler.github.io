<a href="http://dwheeler.com/sloc">A report by David A. Wheeler
on the size of Red Hat Linux version 6.2</a>
has just been released.
Interesting results include the following: 
<ol>
<li>This Linux distribution includes well
over 17 million physical source lines of code (SLOC).
<li>Over 4,500 person-years of development time would have
been required to build this distribution by conventional proprietary means.
<li>It would have cost over $600 million (in year 2000 dollars)
to develop this distribution in the U.S. using conventional proprietary means. 
</ol>
<p>
The largest components (in order) were the linux kernel,
the X-windows server, egcs, and emacs.
The languages with the most lines of code were (in order): C,
C++, LISP, shell, and perl;
many other languages were also represented.
