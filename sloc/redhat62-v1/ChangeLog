	* Clarified that "gcc" is the compilation system & "egcs" was a
	  project to extend egcs, based on feedback from Per Bothner.

	  quantitative evidences.

	* Removed claim that SuSE was derived from Red Hat.
	  SuSE uses Red Hat's RPM, but SuSE predated Red Hat.
	* Included the complete list of languages in the abstract and
	  conclusions, so people wouldn't have to rummage through the
	  paper just to find that.
	* Added a note that I didn't try to eliminate ``nearly duplicate''
	  files, because that's hard to do.
	* Added a note explaining why I counted ALL code, not just the
	  code generated into object code.
	* Showed the disk space used by the source code.
