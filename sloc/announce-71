Linux Today version:

   The article More than a Gigabuck: Estimating GNU/Linux's Size is now available, which examines Red Hat Linux 7.1's source code as a representative GNU/Linux distribution. It
   found that it would cost over $1 billion (a Gigabuck) to develop, that it includes over 30 million physical source lines of code (SLOC), and that it would have required about 8,000
   person-years to develop. Red Hat Linux 7.1 represents over a 60% increase in size, effort, and traditional development costs over Red Hat Linux 6.2 (which was released about one
   year earlier). Its predominant software license is the GNU GPL. See the paper for more information.
