When the seventh day comes and it is time for you to return to the castle in the<br />
forest, your sisters cling to your sleeves.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't go back,&quot; they say, and &quot;When will we ever see you again?&quot; But you<br />
imagine they will find consolation somewhere.<br />
<br />
Your father hangs back, silent and moody. He has spent the week as far from you<br />
as possible, working until late at night. Now he speaks only to ask whether the<br />
Beast treated you &quot;properly.&quot; Since he obviously has his own ideas about what<br />
must have taken place over the past few years, you do not reply beyond a shrug.<br />
<br />
You breathe more easily once you're back in the forest, alone.<br />

<span class="roomname">Drawbridge</span><br />
Even in your short absence, the castle has come to look strange to you again.<br />
When you came here first, you stood a long while on the drawbridge, unready to<br />
cross the moat, for fear of the spells that might bind you if you did. This time<br />
it is too late to worry about such things.<br />
<br />
An iron-barred gate leads north.<br />

You shouldn't be able to open it, heavy as it is, but it swings aside lightly at your touch. The Beast said that it knows friend from enemy; and the castle, at least, still regards you as friend.<br />
<br />
Entrance Hall<br />
There is no fire in the big fireplace, and no one is waiting for you here; the air is very cold. Over the gate, the old familiar warning sign is painted.<br />
<br />
Various passages lead deeper into the castle: north towards the central courtyard, southwest to the guard tower, east and west into the libraries, the offices, the galleries. Somewhere in this maze, he waits; and he should be told as soon as possible that you did return.<br />

<br />
But then you took to eating here; and at the end of every meal he would stand up formally and ask his question.<br />
<br />
&quot;You can leave at any time,&quot; he said, when he first spoke to you. You stared at him, surprised that someone with his face and teeth was capable of human communication. &quot;Would you like to go?&quot;<br />
<br />
There are other memories, more recent, of course. Every glance around the room reminds you of a different one.<br />
<br />

<br />
&quot;I'm surprised you haven't gone home yet,&quot; he said very early in your stay.<br />
<br />
&quot;I've heard stories,&quot; you replied. &quot;As if there weren't enough to see around the castle. I know what happens to your servants who try to leave you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nothing bad would happen to you,&quot; he said. But you could not believe him, not with all the captured spirits, not with the stories, not with the evidence around the castle.<br />
<br />
<span class="prompt">&gt;</span><span class="promptline" id="line111">look</span><br /><a href="#r_linkto112" class="roomname" id="line112">Great Dining Hall</a><br />You allow yourself to remember another night, another request.<br />
<br />
&quot;And now -- would you like to go home?&quot;<br />
<br />
You bit your lip. It had been a pleasant conversation, up until now, when you are reminded: however nicely he may behave, he is still the king of a cursed line, and not to be trusted.<br />
<br />

<br />
&quot;I assure you,&quot; he added. &quot;No harm will come to you if you do go.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I only have your word for that,&quot; you replied, looking stubbornly into your soupbowl.<br />
<br />
He sat. &quot;I am unable to lie to you,&quot; he said. &quot;It is one of the conditions placed upon us. We can only tell the truth.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And why should I believe that?&quot;<br />
<br />
He raised his glass. &quot;I'll try again tomorrow.&quot;<br />
<br />

<br />
&quot;Were you ever married?&quot; you asked, ignoring his question.<br />
<br />
&quot;No.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Then you have no heirs?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I have no legitimate sons,&quot; he replied. &quot;But I certainly have an heir, somewhere. If I died, somewhere, someone would inherit all this, and the whole system would go on as before, the servants and the contracts. But don't worry: I have tried, and it turns out that I don't die easily.&quot;<br />
<br />

<br />
&quot;And you promise I would not regret it? Truthfully.&quot;<br />
<br />
He coughed. &quot;I don't know your future. And -- since you ask I must answer -- I don't think much of your father, a man who would barter his daughter's service for his own, especially since he had unflattering ideas of what I would do with you.&quot;<br />
<br />
You sputtered. &quot;Well of course you couldn't-- I mean, being an animal...&quot;<br />
<br />
His teeth gleamed. &quot;I assure you I could,&quot; he said. &quot;But I won't.&quot;<br />
<br />

<br />
&quot;I have become used to it here,&quot; you answered, surprising yourself. &quot;There is plenty to read; there is the chessman, and games; and you are good company.&quot; He raised his glass with a half smile. &quot;You'd rather stay here without me?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No,&quot; he said.<br />
<br />
<span class="prompt">&gt;</span><span class="promptline" id="line165">look</span><br /><a href="#r_linkto166" class="roomname" id="line166">Great Dining Hall</a><br />You allow yourself to remember another night, another request.<br />
<br />
&quot;I c-care for you,&quot; you said. &quot;I am lonely without you, and you make me laugh, and you're nice...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Stop,&quot; he said. &quot;And remind me never to order the port again.&quot;<br />
<br />
He picked you up from your chair and your head rested on his shoulder. &quot;But why can I not be in love... Oh, carry me carefully on the stairs: I feel sick!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Simply, pet,&quot; he said, walking slowly up the steps. &quot;What you offer I couldn't accept. In fact, I'm not sure what you are offering. Do you have some fantasy of marrying me? Being my mistress?&quot;<br />
<br />
You could not think of the answer; there was no solution that was not absurd. He set you down carefully on the bed and went away. A moment later he came back, bright crimson bell in his left paw. &quot;When you wake in the morning and are very ill, which you will be, ring this and the servants will bring a tonic appropriate to your condition.&quot;<br />
<br />

<br />
&quot;For a visit, if you won't go to stay?&quot; he asked. &quot;We could arrange that too, if you liked.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And nothing bad would happen to anyone I cared about?&quot; you demanded.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nothing bad would happen to you or to your family. There would be no ill health and no spiritual repercussions.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You're leaving something out,&quot; you said, having gotten familiar with the precise way he speaks when hedging around a difficult fact.<br />
<br />
&quot;It could be unpleasant for me,&quot; he replied, strained. &quot;But you mustn't stay because of my feelings on the matter. Your family miss you, and I am the villain in this piece.&quot;<br />
<br />

<br />
&quot;Don't mention the leaving thing once more,&quot; you said. &quot;Or I will throw a glass at your head.&quot;<br />
<br />
He sighed. &quot;You are as stubborn as you are honorable,&quot; he said. &quot;No doubt the two are related.&quot;<br />
<br />

<br />
After a long time: &quot;You haven't asked me to leave in a while,&quot; you said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah.&quot; He looked at his plate of food. &quot;Of course you may go. I'm glad you believe my word about the effects, now.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I will go to visit my family,&quot; you say, stressing the word visit. &quot;On condition that you tell me how to do it so that I will not harm you. If you won't do that, I don't go.&quot;<br />
<br />
He looked at you, his expression cloudy. &quot;There is a very good reason why...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Those are my terms.&quot;<br />
<br />
He sighed. &quot;Very well,&quot; he said. &quot;If your trip lasts fewer than seven days, it will have no effect on anything here.&quot; He looked down at his curled paw. &quot;But if you don't come back -- and I imagine you won't -- I will forgive you.&quot;<br />

Parliamentary Chambers<br />
Despite its grand name, this is one of the smaller chambers of the castle, because the kings were never inclined to brook too much advice. On each side of the room are two neat oak benches, seating for perhaps thirty men -- and, more rarely, women, and a few characters who could not be called by either term.<br />

It comes towards you and circles you, and you have the idea -- more imagination than eyesight -- that this was once a tall, thin man of considerable power.<br />

It says a few words in the bastardized Italian of the state of Medici-Credenza, and you hear the scrape of wood and stone from somewhere below you: a door opening.<br />

<br />
Some additional function for the shoes is suggested by the papers -- something about the preservation of memory or a connection to those who wore them previously -- but it seems that even Lucrezia did not understand this very well.

Command of his slaves then passed to his son.<br />
<br />
From that day on the castle was so built that no one could even enter into it without becoming contracted to its king, for the protection of the royal family.<br />

In the upper chamber, you find, there is almost as much sand as there is below; indeed for all you can tell the flow might be eternal.<br />
<br />
Nearby an open ivory door leads southwest to the smoke-damaged chamber.<br />
<br />
And here Beast lies, sprawled on the ground as if he'd fallen.<br />
<br />
When you look at the Beast this time -- it must be the influence of the girdle -- you see him as more animal than human, though you long ago learned to discern a man's expressions on his face.<br />
<br />
I was afraid of him, says the memory of Yvette in your head, as though she's trying to justify herself to you. There are other thoughts as well, murkier; but you are left with the impression that she killed herself, in the end, not because of her family's misfortunes or the lord she was separated from; but because she was carrying a child, and feared that it would be born some kind of monster.<br />
<br />
<span class="prompt">&gt;</span><span class="promptline" id="line5234">kiss beast</span><br />As you do, you can't help remembering -- because of the girdle -- how many women before you this king imprisoned against their will. And why should he deserve to be forgiven, merely because he has been less cruel to you than to the others?<br />
<br />
When you lift your head, he is his proper self: a man, about forty-five. Handsome, perhaps, but in the style of the lord mayor, not someone you would have aspired to wed. His face has perhaps softened a little since his youth, but he is still recognizably the same person.<br />
<br />
He looks ruefully at his restored hands. &quot;I failed to free them,&quot; he says. &quot;And now I've dragged you into the trouble with me.&quot;<br />
<br />
You shake your head, and try to calm him.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
*** You have restored the King, but not his servants ***<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Would you like to RESTART, RESTORE a saved game, QUIT, or UNDO the last command?<br />

<span class="prompt">&gt;</span><span class="promptline" id="line5254">go to lie library</span><br />You head southwest to the smoke-damaged chamber. And finally east to the lie library.<br />
<br />
Lie Library<br />
Fables, fictions, and falsehoods, arranged by number by type, and containing such categories as &quot;In which the hero receives help from three aged figures,&quot; &quot;In which the villain has a mysterious name,&quot; and so on.<br />
<br />
You can see a storybook and a book return stand (on which are an infernal inkpot (full) and a great contract book) here.<br />
<br />
<span class="prompt">&gt;</span><span class="promptline" id="line5262">ring glass bell</span><br />You summon the librarian, who comes and looks at the contract book: you see this as a sort of fog. It frowns at the condition of some of the pages, then searches the front and back of the book; then, grimacing, it takes out a red seal like those used in the empire of the Chan.<br />
<br />
It inks this carefully from the inkpot, then stamps inside the front of the book:<br />
<br />
<br />
PROPERTY OF THE LIE LIBRARY<br />
DO NOT REMOVE<br />
<br />
...whereupon the contracts inside begin to unravel and dissolve into the merest stories.<br />
<br />
<span class="prompt">&gt;</span><span class="promptline" id="line5273">go to beast</span><br />You head west to the smoke-damaged chamber. And finally northeast to the upper bulb.<br />
<br />

<br />
His fingers stretch in experiment. &quot;Dear virgin mother. You did it. The servants are free?&quot;<br />
<br />
You nod.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good girl.&quot; He touches your cheek affectionately; then freezes. &quot;And you're wearing Yvette's girdle. I suppose you heard her story, in that case.&quot; He sticks out his jaw. &quot;You can go now. It won't kill me, this time.&quot;<br />
<br />
You draw a breath and give him your answer.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
*** You have restored the King and freed his servants ***<br />
<br />
<br />
