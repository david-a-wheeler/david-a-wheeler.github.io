# This is the setup.py script for "flawfinder" by David A. Wheeler.
# My thanks to Jon Nelson, who created the initial setup.py script.

# Template for creating your own setup.py.  See the USAGE file in
# the Distutils source distribution for descriptions of all the
# options shown below.  Brief instructions on what to do:
#   - set the other metadata: version, description, author, author_email
#     and url.  All of these except 'description' are required, although
#     you may supply 'maintainer' and 'maintainer_email' in place of (or in
#     addition to) 'author' and 'author_email' as appropriate.
#   - fill in or delete the 'packages', 'package_dir', 'py_modules',
#     and 'ext_modules' options as appropriate -- see USAGE for details
#   - delete this comment and change '__revision__' to whatever is
#     appropriate for your revision control system of choice (just make
#     sure it stores the revision number for your distribution's setup.py
#     script, *not* the examples/template_setup.py file from Distutils!)
