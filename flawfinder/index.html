<p>
This is the main web site for <i>flawfinder</i>, a simple program that examines
C/C++ source code and reports possible security weaknesses (&#8220;flaws&#8221;)
sorted by risk level.
It&#8217;s very useful for quickly finding and removing at least some
potential security problems <i>before</i> a program is widely released
to the public.
It is free for anyone to use and is available as
<a href="#license">open source software (OSS)</a>.
See <a href="#how_work">&#8220;how does Flawfinder work?&#8221;</a>,
below, for more information on how it works.
Others have had success with flawfinder; see
<a href="#testimonials">testimonials</a> and
<a href="#reviews">reviews/papers</a> for more.
You can skip ahead to
<a href="#documentation">documentation</a> if you want more detail.
<p>
Flawfinder is specifically designed to be easy to install and use.
You can install Python and use pip as follows:
<pre>
    pip install flawfinder
</pre>
After installing it, at a command line just type:
<pre>
    flawfinder <i>directory_with_source_code</i>
</pre>
<p>
You can also use a
<a href="#prepackaged">pre-packaged version of flawfinder</a>
(it's widely available), or
<a href="#downloading">download and install it yourself</a>.
Flawfinder works on Unix-like systems (it&#8217;s been tested on GNU/Linux),
and on Windows by using Cygwin.
It requires Python 2.7 or Python 3 to run.
<p>
Please take a look at
<a href="#othertools">other static analysis tools for security</a>, too.
One reason I wrote flawfinder was to encourage using static analysis tools
to find security vulnerabilities.
<b>No</b> one tool solves all problems, but tools can be a very useful aid
in developing secure software.
It's generally better to use many tools, and the <i>worst</i> situation
is to use <i>no</i> tools.

Others have found it useful.
Here are few testimonials that it&#8217;s received over time:
<ol>
<li>
"Flawfinder is an exceptional source-scanning tool that programmers can depend
on to find the most common security problems with C programs. It is fast, and
the reporting features are detailed and user-friendly. Installing and using
Flawfinder was also relatively simple...
Flawfinder would be recommended as the first of many stages in reviewing
simple to complex applications." -

<li>
Thank you for flawfinder! It has helped me in many ways over the
last year, for which I am truly [grateful]!
- Elfyn McBratney
<!-- beu, at gnu.org  -->
<li>
The other day I was about to clean some old code. After receiving 17K
lines of mixed C/C++ I realized that running some kind of
source code analyser would be a good idea.
I downloaded a whole bunch&#8217;of&#8217;em (tm), but the <i>only</i> tool that
just plain worked on the first run was Flawfinder. 
Easy to use, no hazzles with strange parameters or configfiles!
Instead of learning new software I could concentrate on what I wanted,
namely to get down&#8217;n&#8217;dirty with the code. Thanks!

<h1 id="documentation">Documentation</h1>
<p>
Flawfinder comes with a simple manual describing how to use it.
If you&#8217;re not sure you want to take the plunge to
install the program, you can just look at
the documentation first, which discusses how to use it and
how it supports the CWE.
The documentation is available in the following formats:
<ul>
<li>
<a href="flawfinder.pdf">PDF</a>
<li>
<a href="flawfinder.ps">Postscript</a>
</ul>

<p>
<h1 id="prepackaged">Using a pre-packaged version of flawfinder</h1>
<p>
Many Unix-like systems have a package already available to them,
including Fedora, Debian, and Ubuntu.
Debian and Ubuntu users can install flawfinder using
<tt>apt-get install flawfinder</tt> (as usual);
Fedora users can use <tt>yum install flawfinder</tt>.
Cygwin also includes flawfinder.
It&#8217;s also available in many other distributions.
Flawfinder is available via FreeBSD&#8217;s Ports system
(see
<a href="http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/ports.cgi?query=flawfinder&amp;stype=name">
this FreeBSD ports query for flawfinder</a>
and 
<a href="http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/cvsweb.cgi/ports/security/flawfinder/">
flawfinder info for security-related ports</a>).
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb/ports/devel/flawfinder/">
OpenBSD includes flawfinder in its &#8220;ports&#8221;</a>.
NetBSD users can simply use NetBSD&#8217;s pkgsrc to install flawfinder
(my thanks to Thomas Klausner for doing the 
flawfinder NetBSD packaging).
The <a href="http://fink.sourceforge.net">Fink</a> project,
which packages FLOSS for Darwin and Mac OS X, has a
<a href="http://fink.sourceforge.net/pdb/package.php/flawfinder">Fink
flawfinder package</a>, so users of those systems may find that an easy way to
get flawfinder.

<p>
<h1 id="downloading">Downloading and Installing</h1>
<p>
If there&#8217;s no package available to you, or it&#8217;s old,
you can download and install flawfinder directly.
The current version of flawfinder is 2.0.17.
If you want to see how it&#8217;s changed, view its
<a href="ChangeLog">ChangeLog</a>.
You can even go look at the 
<a href="flawfinder">flawfinder source code</a> directly.
We assume you have a Unix-like system such as a Linux-based system.
If you use Windows, the recommended way is to
install Cygwin first, and install it on top of Cygwin.
However, it has been reported to work on Windows directly.
<p>
First, download it.
You can get the
<a href="flawfinder-2.0.17.tar.gz">current released version flawfinder in .tar.gz (tarball) format)</a> here.
You can also get flawfinder by
<a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/flawfinder/">visiting the
SourceForge flawfinder project page</a>, in particular its
<a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/flawfinder/files/">Files section</a>.
You <i>definitely</i> need to go to the SourceForge project
site if you want to get on the mailing list,
submit a bug report or feature request, or see/get the latest drafts.

<p>
On Unix-like systems, you install it in the usual manner.
First, uncompress the file and become root to install:
<pre>
  tar xvzf flawfinder-*.tar.gz
  cd flawfinder-*
</pre>
Then install.  Typically you would do this (omit "sudo" if you are root):
<pre>
  sudo make prefix=/usr install
</pre>
You can override these defaults using standard GNU conventions.
If you omit the "prefix=/usr" statement, it will store in the default
directory /usr/local.  You can set bindir and mandir to set their
specific locations.
Cygwin systems (for Microsoft Windows) need to set
&#8220;PYTHONEXT=.py&#8221; in the make command, like this:
<pre>
  sudo make PYTHONEXT=.py install
</pre>
<p>
<a href="INSTALL.txt">See the installation instructions for more information</a>.

<p>
Roy Ben Yosef reports that the
the simplest way to run Flawfinder under windows is using Python directly.
Install Python 2 (version 2.7).
and run the flawfinder script (on the command line).
For example:<br>
<tt>C:\Python27\Python.exe flawfinder ‚ÄìH --savehitlist=ReportFolder\hitReport.hit C:\MySourcesFolder</tt>
<br>
In the above example you can Inspect the results (hit file and html report) in the ReportFolder.

<p>
<h1 id="joining">Joining the flawfinder community</h1>
<p>
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/flawfinder/">Flawfinder is now
hosted on SourceForge</a>.
You can discuss how to use or improve the tool on its
mailing list, and you can see the latest drafts on the Subversion
version control system.
<p>
If you have a general question or issue, use the mailing list.
If you have a specific bug, especially if you have a patch, use git
or the issue tracker.

<h1 id="speed">Speed</h1>
Flawfinder is written in
Python, to simplify the task of writing and extending it.
Python code is not as fast as C code, but for the task I believe it&#8217;s
just fine.
Flawfinder version 1.31 averaged an analysis speed of 45,126 lines/second
when it examined the Linux kernel version 3.16 (released 2014-08-03)
on a Intel Core2 Duo CPU E8400 @ 3.00GHz
(each CPU running at 2GHz) running Fedora Linux version 20.
That is because it examined 17,135,214 lines in 36,859 files
in approximately 379.72 seconds (less than 6.5 minutes).
The physical Source Lines of Code (SLOC) was lower: 12,237,248.
The Linux kernel is not the best test case for this tool, since
flawfinder is designed for examining application code (not kernels),
but it is a great test for showing that flawfinder can examine larger programs
in a relatively short time.
In another test,
Flawfinder 1.28 averaged 24,475 lines/second on a 2.8GHz laptop and Cygwin;
Cygwin on Windows tends to be much slower than Linux, but
even on Cygwin flawfinder has a reasonable speed.
Flawfinder 1.20 and later normally report their speed
(in analyzed lines/second) if you&#8217;re curious.
The speed reported begins when the program starts running, not including
the fixed Python start-up time.
<!-- Older data:
Lines analyzed = 3018 in 0.62 seconds (24475 lines/second)

Flawfinder version 0.12 on a 400Mhz Pentium II system
analyzed 51055 lines in 39.7 seconds, resulting in an average of
1285 analyzed lines/second.

Running stock Linux 2.2.16-22 (Red Hat 7) (794.62 bogomips).
Running flawfinder across a subset of Linux kernel code
(51055 lines as determined by ``wc -l'') takes 39.7 seconds of real
(wall clock) time.
Using python 1.5.2-27.

<h1 id="how_work">How does Flawfinder Work?</h1>
<p>
Flawfinder is <i>not</i> a sophisticated tool.
It is an intentionally simple tool, but people have found it useful.
<p>
Flawfinder works by using a built-in database of C/C++
functions with well-known problems, such as
buffer overflow risks (e.g., strcpy(), strcat(), gets(), sprintf(),
and the scanf() family),
format string problems ([v][f]printf(), [v]snprintf(), and syslog()),
race conditions (such as access(), chown(), chgrp(), chmod(),
tmpfile(), tmpnam(), tempnam(), and mktemp()),
potential shell metacharacter dangers
(most of the exec() family, system(), popen()),
and poor random number acquisition (such as random()).
The good thing is that you don&#8217;t have to create this database -
it comes with the tool.
<p>
Flawfinder then takes the source code text, and matches the source code
text against those names, while ignoring
text inside comments and strings (except for flawfinder directives).
Flawfinder also knows about gettext (a common library for internationalized
programs), and will treat constant strings
passed through gettext as though they were constant strings; this reduces
the number of false hits in internationalized programs.
<p>
Flawfinder produces a list of &#8220;hits&#8221; (potential security flaws),
sorted by risk; by default the riskiest hits are shown first.
This risk level depends not only on the function, but on the values of the
parameters of the function.
For example, constant strings are often less risky than fully variable
strings in many contexts.
In some cases, flawfinder may be able to determine that the
construct isn&#8217;t risky at all, reducing false positives.
<p>
Flawfinder gives better information - and better prioritization -
than simply running &#8220;grep&#8221; on the source code.
After all, it knows to ignore comments and the insides of strings, and
it will also examine parameters to estimate risk levels.
Nevertheless, flawfinder is fundamentally a naive program; it
doesn&#8217;t even know about the data types of function parameters,
and it certainly doesn&#8217;t do control flow or data flow analysis
(see the references below to other tools, like
<a href="http://splint.org">SPLINT</a>, which do deeper analysis).
I know how to do that, but doing that is far more work; sometimes
all you need is a simple tool.
Also, because it&#8217;s simple, it doesn&#8217;t get as confused by macro definitions
and other oddities that more sophisticated tools have trouble with.
Flawfinder can analyze software that you can't build; in some cases
it can analyze files you can't even locally compile.
<p>
Not every hit is actually a security vulnerability, 
and not every security vulnerability is necessarily found.
<p>
As noted above, flawfinder doesn&#8217;t really understand the semantics
of the code at all - it primarily does simple text pattern matching
(ignoring comments and strings).
Again, it doesn't do data flow or control flow analysis at all.
Nevertheless, flawfinder can be a very useful aid in finding and removing
security vulnerabilities.
<p>
The documentation points out various security issues when using the tool.
In general, you should analyze a <i>copy</i> of the source code
you&#8217;re evaluating.
Also, do <i>not</i> load or diff hitlists from untrusted sources.
Hitlists are implemented using Python&#8217;s pickle facility,
which is not intended for untrusted input.

<h1 id="reviewing_patches">Reviewing patches</h1>
<!-- This section first publicly Posted 2007-01-10. -->
Sometimes you don&#8217;t want to review an <i>entire</i> program - you
only want to review the set of <i>changes</i> that were made to a program.
If the changes are well-localized (e.g., to a particular section of a file),
this is trivial to do by hand, but it&#8217;s harder otherwise.
Flawfinder 1.27 added automated support so that you can review only
the changes in a program.
<p>
First, create a &#8220;unified diff&#8221; file comparing the
older version to the current version
(using git diff, GNU diff with the -u option, or Subversion&#8217;s diff).
Then run flawfinder on the <i>newer</i>
version, and give it the --patch (-P) option pointing to that unified diff.
<p>
This works because flawfinder will do its job, but it will
only report hits that relate to lines that changed in the unified diff
(the patch file).
Flawfinder will read the unified diff file, which tells flawfinder
what files changed and what lines in those files were changed.
More specifically, it uses &#8220;Index:&#8221; or &#8220;+++&#8221; lines to determine the
files that changed, it uses the line numbers in &#8220;@@&#8221; regions
to get the chunk line number ranges, and it then uses the
initial +, -, and space after that to determine which lines really changed.
<p>
One challenge is statements that span lines; a statement might start on
one line, yet have a change that adds a vulnerability in a later line, and
depending on how the vulnerability is reported it might get chopped off.
Currently flawfinder handles this by showing vulnerabilities that
are reported one line before or after any changed line - which seems
to be a reasonable compromise.
<p>
Note that the problem with this approach is that it won&#8217;t notice if you
<i>remove</i> code that <i>enforces</i> security requirements.
Flawfinder doesn&#8217;t have that kind of knowledge anyway, so that&#8217;s not a big
deal in this case.

<h1 id="fool-with-tool">A Fool with a Tool is still a Fool</h1>
Any static analysis tool, such as Flawfinder,
is merely a tool.
No tool can substitute for human thought!
In short, &#8220;<i>a fool with a tool is still a fool</i>&#8221;.
It&#8217;s a mistake to think that analysis tools (like flawfinder)
are a substitute for security training and knowledge.
Developers - please read documents like
<a href="https://dwheeler.com/secure-programs">my Secure Programming book</a>
so you&#8217;ll understand the vulnerabilities that the tool is trying to find!
Organizations - please make sure your developers understand how to
develop secure software (including learning about
the common mistakes past developers have made),
<i>before</i> having them develop software or use static analysis tools.

<p>
An example of horrific tool misuse is disabling
vulnerability reports without (1) fixing the vulnerability, or
(2) ensuring that it is <i>not</i> a vulnerability.
It&#8217;s publicly known that RealNetworks did this with flawfinder;
I suspect others have misused tools this way.
I don&#8217;t mean to beat on RealNetworks particularly,
but it&#8217;s important to apply lessons learned from others,
and unlike many projects, the details of their
vulnerable source code are publicly available
(and I applaud them for that!).
As noted in
<a href="http://archive.cert.uni-stuttgart.de/vulnwatch/2005/03/msg00000.html">
iDEFENSE Security Advisory 03.01.05 on RealNetworks RealPlayer</a>
(CVE-2005-0455),
a security vulnerability was in this pair of lines:
<pre>
   char tmp[256]; /* Flawfinder: ignore */
   strcpy(tmp, pScreenSize); /* Flawfinder: ignore */
</pre>
<p>
This means that flawfinder <i>did</i> find this vulnerability, but
instead fixing it, someone added the &#8220;ignore&#8221; directive to the code
so that flawfinder would stop reporting the vulnerability.
But an &#8220;ignore&#8221; directive simply stops flawfinder from <i>reporting</i>
the vulnerability - it doesn&#8217;t <i>fix</i> the vulnerability!
The <i>intended use</i> of this directive is to add it once a reviewer
determined that it was definitely a false positive, but in this case
the tool was reporting a real vulnerability.
The same thing happened again in
<a href="http://labs.idefense.com/intelligence/vulnerabilities/display.php?id=250">iDefense Security Advisory 06.23.05</a>, aka
CVE-2005-1766, where the vulnerable line was:
<pre>
   sprintf(pTmp,  /* Flawfinder: ignore */
</pre>
And a third vulnerability with the same issue was reported still later in
<a href="http://www.securityfocus.com/archive/1/472295/30/0/threaded">
iDefense Security Advisory 06.26.07,
RealNetworks RealPlayer/HelixPlayer SMIL wallclock Stack Overflow
Vulnerability</a>,
aka CVE-2007-3410,
where the vulnerable line was:
<pre>
   strncpy(buf, pos, len); /* Flawfinder: ignore */
</pre>

<p>
This is <i>not</i> to say that RealNetworks is a fool or set of fools.
Indeed, I believe many organizations,
not just RealNetworks, have misused tools this way.
My thanks to RealNetworks for publicly admitting their mistake -
it allows others to learn from their mistake!
My specific point is that you can&#8217;t just add comments with &#8220;ignore&#8221; directives
and expect that the software is suddenly more secure.
Do not add &#8220;ignore&#8221; directives until you are certain
that the report is a false positive.
More generally, developers need to understand what they're trying to do
(learn the basics of developing secure software), and then tools can help
them achieve their goals.

<p>
This kind of problem can easily happen in organizations that say
&#8220;run scanning tools until there are no more warnings&#8221; but don&#8217;t
later review the changes that were made to eliminate the warnings.
If warnings are eliminated because code is changed to eliminate
vulnerabilities, that&#8217;s great!
General-purpose tools scanning like flawfinder will have false positive
reports, though; it&#8217;s easy to create a tool without false positives, but
they&#8217;ll do that by failing to report many possible vulnerabilities (some of
which will really <i>be</i> vulnerabilities).
The obvious answer if you want a broader tool
is to allow developers to examine the code, and
if they can truly justify that it&#8217;s a false positive, document <i>why</i>
it is a false positive (say in a comment near the report) and then add
a &#8220;Flawfinder: ignore&#8221; directive.
But you need to really justify that the report is a false positive; just
adding an &#8220;ignore&#8221; directive doesn&#8217;t fix anything!
Sometimes it&#8217;s easier to fix a problem that may or may not be
a vulnerability, instead of ensuring that
it&#8217;s a false positive - the 
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/security.html#process">
OpenBSD developers have been doing this
successfully for years</a>, since if complicated code isn&#8217;t an exploitable
vulnerability yet, a tiny change can often turn such fragile code
into a vulnerability.

<p>
If you&#8217;re in an organization using a scanning tool like this, make sure
you review every change caused by a vulnerability report.
Every change should be either (1) truly fixed or (2)
correctly and completely justified as a false positive.
I think organizations should require any such justification to be in
comments next to the &#8220;ignore&#8221; directive.
If the justification isn&#8217;t complete, don&#8217;t mark it with an &#8220;ignore&#8221; directive.
And before developers even start writing code, get them trained on
how to write secure code and what the common mistakes are;
this material is <i>not</i> typically covered in university classes or
even on the job.

<p>
The &#8220;ignore&#8221; directives are a very useful mechanism - once you <i>have</i>
done the analysis, having to re-do the analysis for no reason could
use up so much time that it would
prevent you from resolving <i>real</i> vulnerabilities.
Indeed, many people wouldn&#8217;t use source scanning tools at all if they
couldn&#8217;t insert &#8220;ignore&#8221; directives when they are done.
The result would be code with vulnerabilities that 
<i>would</i> be found by such tools.
But any mechanism can be misused, and clearly this one has been.

<p>
Flawfinder does include a weapon against useless &#8220;ignore&#8221; directives - the --neverignore (-n) option.  This option is the &#8220;ignore the ignores&#8221;
option - any &#8220;ignore&#8221; directives are ignored.
But in the end, you still need to fix vulnerabilities or ensure
that reported vulnerabilities aren&#8217;t really vulnerabilities at all.

RealNetworks RealPlayer .smil Buffer Overflow Vulnerability

iDEFENSE Security Advisory 03.01.05
www.idefense.com/application/poi/display?id=209&type=vulnerabilities
March 1, 2005

I. BACKGROUND

RealPlayer is an application for playing various media formats,
developed by RealNetworks Inc. For more information, visit
http://www.real.com/.

II. DESCRIPTION

Remote exploitation of a stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability in
the The Synchronized Multimedia Integration Language (smil) file format
parser within various versions of RealNetworks Inc.'s RealPlayer could
allow attackers to execute arbitrary code.

The vulnerability specifically exists due to an unbounded string copying
operation. The vulnerable code is shown below:

datatype/smil/renderer/smil1/smlparse.cpp
CSmil1Parser::testAttributeFailed(SMIL1Node* pNode)
line 2878
***
     if(HXR_OK == rc)
        {
            UINT32 ulScreenHeight = 0;
            UINT32 ulScreenWidth = 0;

            const char* pScreenSize = (const char*)pBuf->GetBuffer();
            // format is screen-height "X" screen-width
            char tmp[256]; /* Flawfinder: ignore */
            strcpy(tmp, pScreenSize); /* Flawfinder: ignore */
***


The pBuf object's datapointer (which is what GetBuffer uses internally)
is pointing at the screen-size attribute in the user-supplied smil file.
This allows a fixed stack buffer to be overwritten with user-supplied
data. An attacker could use this stack overwrite to manipulate a saved
return address or Structured Exception Handler, allowing for arbitrary
code execution.

In order to trigger this vulnerability, one would need an otherwise
valid .smil file with the following line added in an appropriate
section: <text src="1024_768.en.txt" region="size" system-screen-
size="LONGSTRINGX768">

Note that "LONGSTRING" should be more than 256 bytes in order to cause
stack corruption.

III. ANALYSIS

Exploitation allows for arbitrary code execution as the user who opened
the .smil file.

Exploitation requires an attacker to craft a malicious .smil and
convince a user to open it. An attacker could also force a web browser
to refresh and automatically load the .smil file from a normal web page
under the attacker's control. In default installations of RealPlayer
under Windows, Internet Explorer will not prompt the user for an action
when encountering a .smil file. It will open it without delay, thus
allowing a more effective method of exploitation.

IV. DETECTION

iDEFENSE Labs has confirmed that Real Networks Inc.'s RealPlayer 10.5
(6.0.12.1056) on Windows and RealPlayer 10 (10.0.1.436) on Linux are
vulnerable.

The vendor has reported that the following products are vulnerable on
the following platforms:

Windows:
	RealPlayer 10.5 (6.0.12.1056 and below)
	RealPlayer 10
	RealOne Player V2
	RealOne Player V1
	RealPlayer 8
	RealPlayer Enterprise

Mac
	RealPlayer 10 (10.0.0.325 and below)
	RealOne Player

Linux
	RealPlayer 10
	Helix Player

V. WORKAROUND

There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability. Although .smil
files can be disassociated from RealPlayer, it is still possible to
cause these files to load with RealPlayer using other methods. One such
method is loading the file via one of the many ActiveX Controls that
RealPlayer contains. Any effective workaround would prevent RealPlayer
from functioning.

VI. VENDOR RESPONSE

A vendor advisory for this issue is available at:

   http://service.real.com/help/faq/security/050224_player

<p>
Another problem is that if a tool tells you there&#8217;s a problem,
<a href="http://www.links.org/?p=327">
never fix a bug you don&#8217;t understand</a>.
For example, the Debian folks ran a tool that found a purported problem
in OpenSSL; it wasn&#8217;t really a problem, and their
<a href="http://www.debian.org/security/2008/dsa-1571">
fix actually <i>created</i> a security problem.</a>

<p>
More generally,
I am <i>not</i> of the opinion that analysis tools are always 
&#8220;better&#8221; than any other method for creating secure software.
I don&#8217;t really believe in a silver 
bullet, but if I had to pick one, &#8220;developer education&#8221; would be my 
silver bullet, not analysis tools.  Again, a &#8220;fool with a tool is 
still a fool&#8221;.  I believe that when you need secure software,
you need to use a <i>set</i>
of methods, including education, languages/tools where vulnerabilities are less
likely, good designs (e.g., ones with limited privilege),
human review, fuzz testing, and so on;
a source scanning tool is just a part of it.
<a href="http://www.darkreading.com/document.asp?doc_id=146053">Gary McGraw
similarly notes that simply passing a scanning tool does not
mean perfect security</a>, e.g., tools can&#8217;t normally find
&#8220;didn&#8217;t ask for authorization when it should have&#8221;.

<p>
That said, I think tools that search source or binaries
for vulnerabilities usually need to 
be part of the answer if you&#8217;re trying to create
secure software in today&#8217;s world.
Customers/users are generally unwilling to reduce the amount of
functionality they want to something we can easily prove correct,
and formally proving 
programs correct has not scaled well yet (though I commend the work to 
overcome this).   No programming language can prevent all
vulnerabilities from being written in the first place, even though selecting
the right programming language can be helpful.
Human review is <i>great</i>, but it&#8217;s costly in 
many circumstances and it often misses things that tools can pick up. 
Execution testing (like fuzz testing) only checks a miniscule part of
the input space.
So we often end up needing source or binary
scanning tools as part of the process, even though 
current tools have a HUGE list of problems.... because NOT using them is 
often worse. Other methods may find the vulnerability, but other methods 
typically don&#8217;t scale well.

<p>
Oh, a quick aside: ‚ÄúA fool with a tool is still a fool‚Äù is not a new
phrase.
I did a little research on its history; as best as I can determine,
it is a quote attributed to Ron Weinstein, an eminent academic
pathologist, in
<a href="https://www.atsjournals.org/toc/arrd/139/5">The
American Review of Respiratory Disease (1989)
Vol. 139. p. 1280, "Perestroika, Fashion, and the Universal Glue" by
William M. Thurlbeck</a>.

<h1 id="hit_density">Hit Density (Hits/KSLOC)</h1>
One of the metrics that flawfinder reports is hit density, that is,
hits per thousand lines of source code.
In some unpublished work, I and someone else found that hit density
is a helpful relative indicator of the likelihood of security vulnerabilities
in various products.
We examined some open source software, such as Sendmail and Postfix,
and determined the hit density of each; the ones with higher hit density
tended to be the ones with the worse security record in the future.
And that&#8217;s even if none or few of the reported hits were clearly
security vulnerabilities.
<p>
When you think about it, that makes sense.
If a program has a high hit density, it suggests that its developers
often use very dangerous constructs that are hard to use correctly and
often lead to vulnerabilities.
Even if the hits <i>themselves</i> aren&#8217;t vulnerabilities,
developers who repeatedly use dangerous constructs will sooner or later
make the final mistake and allow a vulnerability.
It&#8217;s like a high-wire act --
even talented people will eventually fall if they walk on it long enough.
<p>
This appeared to break down on very small programs (less than 10K);
a program <i>much</i> smaller than its competition might have a larger
hit density yet still be secure.
I speculate that because density is a fraction, when a program is
<i>much</i> smaller than its rivals, density is dramatically forced up
(because size is in the denominator).
Yet programs that are made dramatically smaller are much easier to
evaluate directly, so direct review is more likely to counter
vulnerabilities in this case.

<h1 id="rats">Flawfinder and RATS</h1>
Unbenownst to me, while I was developing flawfinder,
Secure Software Solutions simultaneously developed
<!-- a href="http://www.securesw.com/download_rats.htm">RATS</a> -->
<a href="http://www.fortifysoftware.com/security-resources/rats.jsp">RATS</a>,
which is also a GPL&#8217;ed source code scanner using a similar approach.
We agreed to release our programs simultaneously (on May 21, 2001),
and we agreed to mention each other&#8217;s programs in our announcements
(you can even see the original
<a href="announcement">flawfinder announcement</a>).
Now that we&#8217;ve both released our code, we hoped
to coordinate in the future so that
there will be a single &#8220;best of breed&#8221; source code scanner that is
open source / free software.
This has never happened, and it's not likely to in the near term.
<p>
Until the time where we&#8217;ve figured out how to merge these
dissimilar projects, I recommend that distributions and
software development websites include <i>both</i> programs
(and others as well!).
Each has advantages that the other doesn&#8217;t.
For example, at the time of this writing Flawfinder is easier to use -
just give flawfinder a directory name, and flawfinder will
enter the directory recursively,
figure out what needs analyzing, and analyze it.
Other advantages of flawfinder are that it can handle
internationalized programs (it knows about special calls like gettext(),
unlike RATS), flawfinder
can report column numbers (as well as line numbers) of hits, and
flawfinder can produce HTML-formatted results.
The automated recursion and HTML formatted results make flawfinder
especially nice for source code hosting systems.
The flawfinder database includes a number of entries not in RATS, so
flawfinder will find things RATS won&#8217;t.
In contrast, RATS can handle other programming languages and runs faster.
Both projects are essentially automated advisors, and having <i>two</i>
advisors look at your program is likely to be better than
using only one (it&#8217;s somewhat analogous to having two people review
your code for security).

<h1 id="reviews">Reviews/Papers</h1>

Many have reviewed flawfinder or mentioned flawfinder in articles,
as well as related tools.

&#8220;Code Injection in C and C++ : A Survey of Vulnerabilities and Countermeasures&#8221;
</a>
by Yves Younan, Wouter Joosen, and Frank Piessens
(Report CW386, July 2004,
Department of Computer Science, K.U.Leuven)
is a comprehensive survey of <i>many</i> different ways to counter
vulnerabilities.
Its abstract says,
&#8221;
... This report documents possible vulnerabilities in C and C++ applications
that could lead to situations that allow for code injection
and describes the techniques generally used by attackers to exploit them.
A fairly large number of defense techniques have been described
in literature. An important goal of this report is to give a comprehensive
survey of all available preventive and defensive countermeasures
that either attempt to eliminate specific vulnerabilities entirely or
attempt to combat their exploitation.
Finally, the report presents a synthesis of this survey that allows
the reader to weigh the advantages and disadvantages of using a
specific countermeasure as opposed to using another more easily.&#8221;
They list a wide variety of countermeasures and describe their
pros and cons.
For example,
They state that flawfinder, as well as RATS and ITS4,
all have the advantages of &#8220;very low&#8221; comparitive cost
and &#8220;very low&#8221; memory cost, and that all can find vulnerabilities
in the categories
V1 (Stack-based buffer overflow),
V2 (Heap-based buffer overflow), and
V4 (Format string vulnerabilities).
All have the applicability limitations
A1 (Source code required) and
A10 (Only protects libc string manipulation functions).
All have the protection limitation
P17 (False negatives are possible).
<!--
In all cases they focus on T2 (Prevention: The vulnerability is prevented),
and in all cases they perform R6, A problem is reported.
-->
That&#8217;s a fair description of the strengths and weaknesses of flawfinder
and similar tools.

<li>
<a href="http://www.linuxjournal.com//article.php?sid=5673"><i>Source Code Scanners for Better Code</i></a>
in Linux Journal discusses Flawfinder, RATS, and ITS4.
The review noted that the version of flawfinder they used
had a weakness - it didn&#8217;t automatically report static character buffers.
That weakness has since been corrected;
flawfinder as of version 1.20 can also report static character buffers
