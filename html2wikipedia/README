OBSOLETE LICENSE MODIFICATION

At one time I made the following ADDITIONAL requirement.
As of June 11, 2006, I have removed that additional requirement.
For historical purposes, here is what the addition was:

"I do NOT want this program used on websites (like wikipedia) unless
they make their database available for download to the public,
so here's the modification to the GPL:

Individuals can use the program on their own system as they wish,
as long as there is no automated use that can be invoked by another,
under the normal terms of the GPL.
To allow this program to be invoked by another's actions automatically
(e.g., automatically by Wikipedia), the resulting database must be
downloadable by the public and maintained (at least 1/month),
in addition to the GPL requirements."


INSTALL

 To uncompress and install on a Unix-like system, do this:

 tar xvzf html2wikipedia*tar.gz
 cd html2wikipedia*

 make && make install


USAGE

 It's a filter.  You can use it like this:

 html2wikipedia < stuff.html > stuff.wiki


NOTES

  I have some test files.  "test.html" is a normal HTML file;
  "micro-test.html" is an HTML file generated by Microsoft Word.
