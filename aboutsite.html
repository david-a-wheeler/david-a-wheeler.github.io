<h1>About this Site</h1>
This is my <i>personal</i> website, where I post documents and software
I've written, in the hopes that you'll find them interesting or useful.
It includes serious articles, useful programs,
and purely whimsical stuff too.
Since this is a <i>personal</i> site,
<a name="disclaimer">this site's content is not endorsed</a>
by David A. Wheeler's employer,
government, or <a href="wiggles.html">guinea pig</a>.
<p>
Here's some information that may help you.


<h1>Yes, you can donate!</h1>
<p>
I gladly take donations.
The easy way is to use
<a href="https://www.paypal.com">Paypal</a> to send a donation
dwheeler&nbsp;@&nbsp;dwheeler.com.
Thanks so much for your generousity!

<h1>Can I link?</h1>
<p>
If you find any of my material interesting, <i>please</i> link to it
and recommend that material to others.  I'd appreciate it!
You don't need to ask permission to link to the material on a website,
including mine;
<i>just link to it</i>.
There's no legal requirement to ask for permission to link (at least in the
U.S.).
In April 2000, Federal Judge Harry L. Hupp in his ruling on deep
linking <i>Ticketmaster vs. Tickets.com, Inc</i>, 2000 U.S. Dist LEXIS
12987 (D. Cal. 2000), stated that, "hyperlinking does not itself involve
a violation of the Copyright Act... since no copying is involved".
This is confirmed by the
<a href="http://www.cendi.gov/publications/04-8copyright.html">
"Frequently Asked Questions About Copyright",
from the CENDI Copyright Working Group,
January 2, 2002 (updated August 2007),
question 2.4.6 "Is it copyright infringement to link from your
website to copyrighted material on another"</a>.
It is a real hardship on authors when millions of people send
link permission requests.

<p>
If you <i>have</i> to get written permission to create a
link to my site, I <i>will</i> provide it.
But that is extra work for me, so I charge $50 per request to cover my time.
Please <a href="contactme.html">contact me</a> for details.
Alternatively, just admit that the law <i>already</i> gives you
free speech rights, including permission to use citations such as links.

<p>
In a few cases I know that some URLs will change; in those cases,
I try to post recommendations on what to link to instead, and I highly
recommend that you follow my recommendations (for your own sanity's sake!).
The notion of asking for permission to link is just silly;
the <i>whole point</i> of the World Wide Web is to enable links.
If you don't want people linking to specific material, keep it off the Web.

<p>
And yes, that includes well-known sites like Slashdot and Groklaw
(when Groklaw was running).
Feel free to recommend my stuff even to sites that may pound me with
lots of simultaneous readers.
Which brings me to my next point...

<h1>References from other sites</h1>

<p>
Please <i>do</i> refer to this website from other sites, even popular ones.
I'd be delighted, since that usually means that more
people will read and use my material.

<h1>Dead links expected</h1>
<p>
Some of the URL links on my site are dead.
It's impossible to prevent it, because things change all the time.
If someone provides me with a replacement link for a dead link,
I will generally fix it.
However, just saying "this link is dead" isn't helpful;
I'd rather include a dead link, helping people find the information,
than remove a link entirely.
No one pays me to maintain this site, so I just can't spend the
time researching new places for every
dead link (that would be a full-time job!).
If you find a dead link, the
<a href="https://archive.org/">Internet archive (especially
its Wayback Machine)</a> is probably a good place to start.

<h1>HTTPS and other security headings</h1>
<p>
This site uses HTTPS.
This has three advantages: (1) privacy for users (others will not know
which pages are being viewed on this site),
(2) authentication that they're really seeing my site (and not someone else's),
and
(3) integrity for the pages (e.g., others such as ISPs will not be able to
hijack these pages en route).
People who request non-HTTPS are automatically rerouted to HTTPS,
told it's a permanent reroute, and are also told to use HTTPS for future
connections to this site
(using HTTP Strict Transport Security, aka HSTS).
<p>
This site is currently hosted by GitHub and uses certificates from
<a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2014/11/certificate-authority-encrypt-ent
ire-web">Let&#8217;s encrypt</a>.
<p>
I'm not made of money, so I've intentionally chosen
inexpensive solutions.
I don't have a CAA record (yet), because namecheap
(my DNS provider) doesn't support them yet.
That said, this is a bunch of static pages, so many issues don't
apply in this case.

<h1>Why was there a "www"?</h1>
<p>
For many years the primary name of the site was www.dwheeler.com.
Historically the standard recommended practice was that
website domains use the "www." subdomain,
and this website dates back to that time.
Thus, the canonical URLs for this site started with "www." in the domain name.
I was fine with that setup, but then Chrome started falsifying
URLs by omitting the www.
Since many people use Chrome, I decided to drop the www so that Chrome users
would see the correct domain name.
<p>
For a while I've forwarded all www.dwheeler.com to dwheeler.com, and
Google knew to do that automatically.
I still forward www.dwheeler.com to dwheeler.com
if the original uses http (not https).
Unfortunately I no longer redirect www.dwheeler.com to dwheeler.com if
the original is https, because GitHub doesn't support that.
If there's still a link on my site to www.dwheeler.com, please let me know.

<!--
I've decided, as
<a href="https://www.sitepoint.com/domain-www-or-no-www/">have others</a>,
that it's more important to decide on <i>some</i> rule for a site
and stick with it.
sticking to the same rule makes life easier for search engines and humans...
it means that the same URL, over time, leads you to the same place.
-->

<h1>Site history</h1>
<p>
This site began September 12, 1999; some content predates the site.
<!-- I was once hosted by LinuxAvenue at www.linuxave.net;
     it was hosted for years by Webframe; in June 2005 I moved to
     Bruce Perens' site. -->
It was originally hosted by LinuxAvenue,
but on November 5, 2001 (after about 2 years)
I switched to Webframe.org in the Netherlands,
which worked well for nearly four years.
At that time the website ran on OpenBSD, an operating system with a deservedly
excellent reputation for its security.
Webframe then got bought out and changed business directions;
after some discussions, there was an amicable agreement that I should
transition to a new hosting site.
So on June 9, 2005,
I switched hosts to planet.perens.com,
a Debian GNU/Linux system run by Bruce Perens.
In 2009 I moved to a commercial hosting service, WebhostGIANT,
using CentOS (this is based on Red Hat Enterprise Linux).
It
<a href="http://www.hostjury.com/reviews/webhostgiant">appears
that WebHostGIANT is now part of WebIntellects</a>, and that the
www.webhostGIANT.com domain is basically dead (it is now a link farm).
There is a Russian WebHostGiant.ru and a web-host-giant.com;
to my knowledge they are unrelated, but they have miseadingly confusing names.
<!-- I still get emails from webhostGIANT.com; billing is from
 http://whg-billing.secure-wi.com/
On 2014-08-24:
www.dwheeler.com.       1023    IN      A       208.86.184.80
-->
<a href="http://www.findownersearch.com/web-intellects-3916762-brand.html">Web intellects appears to be owned by Jumpline</a>.
Unfortunately, in 2020 they started being unreliable and then they
ignored all ticket requests.
So in 2021 I hurriedly switched to hosting via GitHub.
<a href="http://www.web-hosting-top.com/">Who knows, I may need
to move again in the future</a>.

<p>
I was able to easily switch between these different
locations in a way that most people didn't even notice,
because I made sure I owned
my domain name (and trademark), dwheeler.com, right from the beginning.
I strongly recommend that website owners directly own their own name!
I also made sure that I didn't depend on software proprietary to a
particular hosting environment, making it easy to switch.
In short,
<a href="https://dwheeler.com/blog/2009/05/02#own-your-own-site">own your own site</a>.

<h1>Searching</h1>
<p>
I have a simple <a href="search.html">search page</a> for people
who want to search just the site.
It's on a separate page, because it embeds Javascript loaded
from another site (Google).
I do this to enhance user privacy;
I don't want people to be tracked simply because they visited my
front page, so I do not embed that into my front page.
I figure that if someone is asking to do a search, they're already expecting
to send some data to someone.

<h1>Miscellaneous</h1>
<p>
This website is fundamentally a simple static set of files,
served as web pages.
<p>
I maintain the content on a separate protected GNU/Linux "test" system,
where I run various programs to maintain changes.
Those include document processing programs (like a Docbook toolchain)
and little scripts I've written (using XSLT, sed, shell, and so on).
When writing text, I usually use the excellent text editor
<a href="http://www.vim.org">vim</a> (yes,
<a href="http://www.tarunz.org/~vassilii/srom/">vim rules</a>,
though I do use emacs once in a while).
I then use rsync and openssh to send the updates from my test system
to the main website.
The tool rsync does an amazing job at sending only what needs to be
updated, so my updates can happen quickly, and openssh protects my
communications from attackers.
<a href="https://dwheeler.com/blog/2009/01/08#update-website-with-rsync">
I've posted a little about using rsync to maintain web content</a>.
Using this approach,
attackers will find it difficult to take over the update process, and
even if an attacker takes over the main website, I always have
a master protected copy (at my test system); I can simply re-upload
my website and whatever they've changed is gone.
<p>
I've intentionally decided to serve only static pages from my website;
this makes my site <i>much</i> harder to attack
and gives excellent performance too.
Not every website can decide to use only static content, with a separate
site used for actual changes &mdash; but if you can, I suggest it.
Nothing makes a system immune to attack, but I've tried to make it
less susceptible.

Much of the material is written using simple HTML.
One wonderful thing about HTML is that it's a fully open standard:
the specification is publicly available,
not controlled by any one vendor,
implementable by anyone without restrictions
(such as software patent licensing),
and supported by multiple products.
Open standards are a good way to avoid the
<a href="http://www.antipatterns.com/vendorlockin.htm">Pottersville
anti-pattern</a>.

<p>
I make sure that the
<a href="http://www.westciv.com/style_master/house/good_oil/not_paper/">
HTML placed here is adaptable</a>,
and in particular that the HTML reflows (e.g., that it is "liquid"
or "elastic") to adjust to the user's browser;
I don't assume a single fixed width.

<!--
I think
<a href="http://www.thesitewizard.com/archive/fixedvsrelative.shtml">
fixed-width web pages are a terrible idea</a>.
I intentionally avoid specifying specific fonts, absolute font sizes,
fixed table widths, and so on.
Instead, I insist that every page on this site flows.
The world wide web can be accessed on a variety of devices
(handhelds, big screens, cheap systems usings old televisions,
printed to printers) by people with a variety
of needs (acute vision, poor vision, the blind, and so on), so
<i>it's important to let users determine
how the information is displayed to them</i>.
When you let it flow as "liquid" then the material always works, no
matter what the size.

<p>
The claimed "problem" with liquid is that the reading lines are
"too long".
Guess what, some us <i>like</i> the long lines, especially when we're
skimming material, and most reading on the web is skimming.
There's some research about long lines, e.g.,
<a href="https://cdn.tc-library.org/Edlab/eye-tracking%20article.pdf"
>"Computer text line lengths affect reading and learning"
by Peter Orton, Ph.D. (IBM Center for Advanced Learning)</a>.
But this research result is often <i>irrelevant</i> to many
readers of my web pages.
Orton's paper,and the work that it refers to, provides some evidence
that limiting the maximum display width
tends to increase retention by those who read the entire article top-to-bottom.
But that assumes everyone reads everything, which is <i>unlikely</i>
for many of my pages.
People viewing my web pages often skim to get the gist, and then home in
on specific sections they want to view.
Modern computer screens often have a generous width and a pitiful height,
so allowing full reflow allows skimming users to more quickly see what they
might be interested in and get what they want.
If a user wants to limit the width, that user
can just drag the edge to the size they want.
Again, users are different, by using flowing HTML the user
can choose what best meets their needs.
-->

<p>
I try to use the <a href="https://validator.w3.org/">W3C HTML validator</a>
to make sure that the HTML is correct.
More recently I've started using
<a href="https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/">Pagespeed</a>
to detect problems (especially mobility / smartphone related issues).

<p>
I know how to use cascading style sheets (CSS), and I do use CSS,
but I try to rig my HTML and CSS (<i>especially</i> on
the front page) so that browsers that don't understand CSS can still
display it reasonably.
On many pages I don't bother to use CSS, or use it sparingly.
In fact, in general I try to be conservative in my use of HTML - not
everyone has the
latest software, and keeping things simple lets me concentrate on
content instead of on useless fluff.
Keeping things simple also means relatively fast download times for
people with slow connections.
If you want dancing bears, sorry, none here.
Here, content is king.

I write most of my dates in ISO 8601 (YYYY-MM-DD) format, in fact,
<a href="http://xkcd.com/1179/">I recommend that everyone
use ISO date format in most cases</a>.
Different regions historically write dates differently, resulting in
lots of confusion.
Is "01-02-03" January 2, 2003?  February 1, 2003?  February 3, 2001?
By organizing dates and times to from most to least significant, and
always using the full year number, dates sort correctly,
avoid the upcoming "2100" problem, and are clear to all.
(If you use natural sorting, you even avoid sort problems with the year 10000.)

<p>
I am a security expert, but I also have limited time and little money.
Remember, this is my <i>personal</i> site;
since no one pays me to maintain it, I can't spend much time or money
doing so.
Like most small sites, this site can be easily taken down by
significant distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack.
I pay others to maintain my infrastructure (because I have limited time)
and that infrastructure is shared with many others
(because I have little money).
A sophisticated attacker should be able to break in, unfortunately.
I do apply various defensive measures,
but since I can't spend a lot of time and money on them,
I focus on recovery (e.g., by having many backups).
That way, I can concentrate on releasing new goodies.

<p>
I try to be quite generous with how I license material on my website;
my goal is generally to make information available for others!
But please respect the limits I've placed on them.
I often choose a "copylefting" license for stuff I post on my site;
I don't make any money directly from the material, and by licensing it
that way I hope to receive back improvements as payment instead.
Most of the material here has licensing information attached with it.

More recently I've begun putting ad space from Google on my site.
Lots of people have asked to put ads on my site, and in the past I've
refused to do so because of other factors I worry about.
In particular,
I jealously guard my independence, and I will continue to protect myself
from being swayed by any vendors.
Also, I also want to make sure that my readers aren't deceived
(e.g., by "articles" that are actually unmarked ads, a practice I find
deceptive).
However, I do end up with a lot of little expenses that add up.
It also costs me a lot of time to make this information available, which
obviously I could use in other ways.
So how can I cover those expenses without
directly accepting ads from specific parties?
After thinking about it, I realized that Google ads are a great answer.
By letting Google pick the ads, I avoid being influenced by
any party (I won't even <i>know</i> who is advertizing in most cases).
Since they are clearly marked as ads, they aren't deceiving to readers.
So, I think using Google ads meets my requirements; it enables
me to be completely independent and avoid deception of readers.
What's particularly nice is that Google uses web site
content to identify the most relevant ads; that means you're likely
to see products or services that you <i>want</i> to know about.
I <i>like</i> the idea of inserting pieces of information that is
especially likely to be useful to my readers.
If you truly hate ads, use the Firefox browser and install the
Adblock plus extension, though obviously you will then miss out on the
helpful pieces of information too.

My front page doesn't obey the "rules" by some website "experts"
and I this it's useful to explain why.
There are many books that explain how to create website front pages,
intended for use by large corporations with huge staffs whose sole
job is maintaining the website, and trying to make the information
easily findable and usable by users.
I can't match that effort, and what's more,
I don't think I should try.
Instead, I'm inspired by the excellent paper
<a href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1138083">"Government Data and the Invisible Hand"</a>, which explained why
it is a mistake for governments to try to create one true way to
access data.
In their paper, they proposed that government should
"specify that the federal government’s primary objective as an
online publisher is to provide data that is easy for others to reuse,
rather than to help citizens use the data in one particular way or another."
I'm not the government, but I can take the same step &mdash;
I can make the data easy to get and reuse, instead of being all things
to all people.
In particular, I can make it easy for people to search for what they need.
Thus, the website front page is easily searchable for main topics, and
every page on my site is easily traversed by web search engines.
I work to choose clear titles, and add metadata to most HTML pages
explaining what the page is about and what keywords would apply.
I also work hard to NEVER change URLs, and to use URLs that
hint at their content before people follow them
(e.g., the URLs usually have a keyword or two, so people can determine
if they want to read it or not).
In short, I try to make it easy for people to find my material by using
a search engine (such as the amazing Google).
If a user gets to my front page, then they must be looking for a basic
map of the whole site and so that's what I show.
(Perhaps they're not sure what to look for!)
This approach may not follow the "rules" of some books, but
it makes it easy for me to maintain this site
(necessary, because I need to spend time creating content),
and I think it makes it easy for people to use
(because they can use arbitrary search engines to find specific material,
and the front page to see what's available).


<h1>Trademark</h1>

<a name="trademark"><b>Trademark notice:</b></a>
"dwheeler.com" (TM), "www.dwheeler.com" (TM),
"drdavidawheeler" (TM),

identifying products and services developed by David A. Wheeler.
Obviously, you can use that phrase when referring to my site and
materials - please do, that's what trademarks are for, to identify
someone's material!
But if you think it'd be fun to write something and
fradulently claim I did it,
write a book without my permission
and use one of my marks in the title,
or in some other way misuse these marks in a way that might
mislead the public,
<a href="http://grep.law.harvard.edu/article.pl?sid=04/08/06/033216&amp;mode=nested">think again.</a>
In particular,
I've owned the domain name for years, and domain names have worldwide
recognition, so don't try to steal it.
(The
<a href="http://grep.law.harvard.edu/article.pl?sid=04/08/06/033216&amp;mode=nested">problems of Katie Jones</a>, owner of the katie.com domain,
caused me to add this notice to clarify things.)
In the past I asserted
trademark status for "OpenFormula" so that whatever
vendor-neutral standards body would have a clear,
unencumbered right to it, and to make sure <i>everyone</i>
can implement it.
At this point that seems to have been accomplished, so I no longer
assert a trademark status for "OpenFormula" (I'll let OASIS deal with that
if they want to).

<h1>DMCA Safe Harbor</h1>
<p>
Although I write a lot of my site's material,
some of my site's material is provided to me by others.
It is my policy and intent that anything posted on the site is 100% legal.
(There may be a copyright, but as long as the use is authorized it is
still legal.)
If you believe that anything on my site is infringing, then please
notify me as you would with any other service provider.
(I am providing a network service, specifically a storage service.)
As described in the
<a href="http://www.chillingeffects.org/dmca512/">Digital Millenium Copyright Act (DMCA) safe harbor</a> laws,
<a href="https://dwheeler.com/contactme.html">please notify
me (David A. Wheeler) immediately if you are the copyright owner
and believe that my site includes infringing materials</a>.
I am my own agent for copyright complaints.
You must provide the
<a href="https://www.chillingeffects.org/dmca512/faq.cgi#QID130">usual
DMCA information required for proper takedown</a>.
Since a takedown request must come from a copyright owner, you need to
provide good evidence that you are the copyright owner or speak for the owner.
(This counters the risk of a non-copyright owner sending a takedown
for material they do not like, but have no authority to take down.)
This is the proper notification and takedown procedure.
Please remember that I am <i>not</i> a lawyer, and I am an individual
not a company; I do not have the time or resources that a
thousand-person company would have.
