#  "throw axe at dwarf ; get axe" repeatedly to kill him.
# When pirate appears, go to "West End of Hall of Mists", then
#   S; E; S; N; GET ALL; SE; N; D returns you to "Orange River Chamber". 
# DO NOT use the coins in the vending machine - you need the coins to

"There is a loud explosion, and a twenty-foot hole appears in the far
wall, burying the dwarves in rubble.  You march through the hole and
find yourself in the main office, where a cheering band of friendly
elves carry the conquering adventurer off into the sunset.

   *** You have won ***

In that game you scored 350 out of possible 350, in 288 turns, earning
you the rank of Grandmaster Adventurer!

Would you like to RESTART, RESTORE a saved game, see some suggestions
for AMUSING things to do or QUIT?"

In the "AMUSING" section, a menu item with "Did you know..." notes that
weird stuff like "The five dwarves have a 96% chance of following you,
except into light, down pits or when admiring themselves... watering
the hinges of the door rusts them up again..."
