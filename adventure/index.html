This is a brief page about the original text adventure game, <i>Adventure</i>.

I've won the 350-point game, and thought I'd share my maps and solution.
Here are my maps:

Here's my
<a href="adventure-solution.txt">original Adventure solution/walkthrough</a>
for the original 350-point game.
You only have a limited amount of time with the lamp,
so any final walkthrough like this will mix up puzzle solutions.
<p>
You can download many different versions of Adventure at no charge.
One nice one is <a href="Advent.z5">Advent.z5</a> (12-Jun-2006),
Adventure aka Colossal Cave. This is the original 350 points
version ported to Inform by Graham Nelson,
based on Dave Baggett's TADS reconstruction "Colossal Cave Revisited".
(This is Release 9 / Serial number 060321.)
To play this, you need a Z-machine player.
<a href="http://inform-fiction.org/zmachine/interpreters.html">
There are lots of Z-machine players out there</a>,
including
<a href="http://www.d.kinder.btinternet.co.uk/frotz.html">Frotz for Windows</a>,
<a href="http://www.logicalshift.demon.co.uk/mac/zoom.html">Zoom for MacOS</a>,
and

If you're interested in the history of Adventure,
a lot of background on the original Adventure game (and the
cave it's based on) is discussed in

"Somewhere Nearby is Colossal Cave: Examining Will Crowther's Original 'Adventure' in Code and in Kentucky" by
Dennis G. Jerz of Seton Hill University
(Digital Humanities Quarterly, Summer 2007, Volume 1 Number 2)</a>
For a long time the original code had been lost, but
the
<a href="http://jerz.setonhill.edu/if/crowther/">
original Fortran source code of Adventure</a> has been found, showing that
Will Crowther's original version was a game - Crowther's original
version included magic words, dwarves, and so on.
<!--
The new evidence establishes that Crowther wrote the game during
the 1975-76 academic year and probably abandoned it in early 1976;
the recovered files themselves date from 1977.

after the source code was available, someone ported it and got it
running</a>
(<a href="http://www.russotto.net/~russotto/ADVENT/">here is the
original Adventure, runnable</a>).
