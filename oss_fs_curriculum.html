<p>
This is an early draft of curriculum for a course in
<a href="oss_fs_refs.html">open source software / free software (OSS/FS)</a>.
This course is intended for college/university students,
at the junior/senior level or graduate school, as an elective.
It's presumed that the students are already familiar with general
software development issues, and at least have a basic understanding
of how proprietary software is developed and sold.
<p>
Here's a course description:
<blockquote>
This course will explore the Open Source Software / Free Software (OSS/FS)
movement from the historical, legal, economic, public policy,
and technical perspectives to gain a better understanding of it.
OSS/FS is changing the software industry and we will look at why and how.
Part of each class will discuss topics from the pages of
newspapers and trade magazines to place the issues in the context of the
course.
</blockquote>
<p>
The numbers indicate order, not a "class number",
in some cases several could be combined into a single class.
When in doubt, I've left a topic in, because it's easier to
remove than to add - but that means there's probably too much here for
one semester.
<p>
I still need to add reading lists to each part.
It has many ESR references (and a number of RMS references), but 
given the subject matter that seems appropriate.

<p>
TODO: It's harder to find "anti" OSS/FS, but certainly some should be
added for fairness, particularly Microsoft's claims and counter-claims.
Look at
http://eu.conecta.it/paper/paper.html

<p>
Since it's hard to start from a blank piece of paper, hopefully
this document is a start.

 Equal footing: saving money, increasing options (see U.S. DoD).
 Encourage: increase industrial base, reduce dependence on outsiders,
   increase security/safety, reduce "digital divide", reduce piracy
   (WTO precondition) (See China, Japan).
 Issues: is governmental funding of an OSS/FS like paying a proprietary
 vendor (e.g., like a site license)?
 GPL'ing research results; requiring/default all research results be
 licenses under an OSS/FS license, etc.
 Policies that impede OSS/FS (DMCA, software patents).

 Briefly discuss common tools:
<ol>
<li>
 Configuration Management tools: Why CM tools are critical;
 diff/patch (Larry Wall) and their importance;
 Non-locking CM tools (esp. CVS) and importance to OSS
<li>
 Build system: make and friends, autoconf.
<li>
 Editors: vim, emacs, and the ancient vi/emacs rivalry.
<li>
 Development Languages. http://dwheeler.com/sloc for Language usage
 analysis. Compare major languages: C, C++, shell (including ksh),
 Lisp, assembly, Perl, Fortran, Python, tcl, Java, yacc/bison,
 expect, lex/flex, (awk, Objective-C, Ada, C shell, Pascal, and sed).
<li>
 gcc suite.
<li>
 Source debuggers.
<li>
 Program libraries: importance. Static/shared/dynamic libraries.
 Impact of library licenses (GPL vs. LGPL vs. MIT).
<li>
 Portable GUIs: wxWindows, Mozilla, etc. Web browser as universal
interface
<li>
 IDEs.
<li>
 Program generators, multi-lingual approaches. Why "make" and
 "primitive text techniques" continue to thrive when developing
 larger programs instead of IDEs.
<li>
 Source distribution: tarballs.
 The standard "./configure &amp;&amp; make &amp;&amp; make install".
<li>
 Package managers (compare deb and rpm, Debian and Red Hat's).
</ol>
<p>
 Discuss The impact of potentially having ALL code (including libraries)
 available when considering alternatives, performance monitoring, debugging.
<p>
 Linux distributions: how each are created/built.
 Use Debian and Red Hat as two contrasting examples.
 Discuss Debian "stable" vs. "unstable",
 organizational structure, rules/policies. Distributed package development.
 Discuss Red Hat, Red Hat CDs, how it creates its packages.
 Comparing their results.

<p>
<li><b>Standards</b>.
 Importance of standards.
 Impact of OSS on standards (e.g., as "reference implementation").
 Impact of standards on OSS (e.g, generally implement, submarine patents).

 Major standards: POSIX, ISO C, TCP/IP, HTTP, HTML.
 Linux Standard Base (LSB).
 Freedesktop.org.

</ol>

<p>
<li><b>Applying OSS concepts outside software</b>.

 Some OSS/FS advocates have stated that OSS/FS may not apply
 elsewhere, and that if it fails in other fields that doesn't mean it
 fails for software.

 Discuss Wikipedia/Wikimedia.
 See the New Scientist article
 <a
href="http://www.newscientist.com/hottopics/copyleft/copyleftart.jsp">
 The Great Giveaway</a> by Graham Lawton, which discusses
 <a href="http://www.opencola.com/products/3_softdrink">
 OpenCola</a>,
 the <a href="http://www.openmusicregistry.org">Open Audio License
(OAL)</a>,
 <a href="http://www.wikipedia.com">Wikipedia</a>,
 and the OpenLaw project
 (at the Berkman Center for Internet and Society at Harvard Law School).
 The article makes a minor mistake: the GPL is the most common OSS/FS
license,
 but it's not the <i>only</i> such license.. but that mistake doesn't really
 detract from the point of the article.
 The <a href="http://creativecommons.org">Creative Commons</a> group
 has developed a set of licenses for written material of any kind, many
 of them clearly based on OSS/FS concepts (i.e., the ones that allow
 modifications and commercial uses of the work).
 Also discuss efforts in scientific journals to ensure scientific works
 are freely available to the public (or at least other scientists).
 Discuss aspects of a work that might suggest OSS/FS approaches would
 work, or would not work.

Supplemental Readings:
Daily perusal of stories at Slashdot.org, Newsforge.com,
LinuxToday.com, and LWN.net for in-class discussion.

<p>
Students should write a paper or give a presentation on a related topic.
Examples:
<ol>
<li>Examine an existing OSS/FS project in-depth
(e.g., what it does, its licensing approach, its history, who participates in
development, who uses it, examining its design, hands-on evaluation,
what are its strengths and weaknesses, how does it compare to
its competitors, what is your prognosis for its future).
<li>Examine/discuss developer or firm motivations
for developing or using OSS/FS (or, choosing not to).
Are they justified?
<li>
Another might be to examine in more depth a general topic, such as
a specific legal issue (enforceability of GPL,
what is a "derived work"),
proposed government policy, and so on.
<li>
Compare and contrast OSS/FS licenses, and examine some unusual ones.
Why have they not caught on?
<li>
What are the challenges of OSS/FS?
Identify them, and discuss how they might (or might not be) overcome.
