Transcript of Michael S. Gentry's &quot;Anchorhead&quot;, by David A. Wheeler<br />
<br />
{I wish I'd made a transcript while trying to solve Anchorhead, because<br />
there's a lot of interesting text in the game... but I didn't.<br />
So instead I started over, started a transcript, and used the<br />
walkthrough by Aeron Pax along with a lot of extra &quot;examinations&quot; and<br />
&quot;look&quot;s to get a sense of the place.&nbsp;&nbsp;This way, you can at least enjoy<br />
some of the text of Anchorhead.&nbsp;&nbsp;Note: In a few places the commands<br />
seem &quot;miraculous&quot; because they don't really search around to find out<br />
what to do, as you would in a real game.&nbsp;&nbsp;If you want to experience<br />
the game, you should just go play it.}<br />

<br />
<br />
November, 1997.<br />
<br />
<br />
You take a deep breath of salty air as the first raindrops begin to spatter<br />
the pavement, and the swollen, slate-colored clouds that blanket the sky<br />
mutter ominous portents amongst themselves over the little coastal town of<br />
Anchorhead.<br />
<br />
Squinting up into the glowering storm, you wonder how everything managed to<br />
happen so fast. The strange phone call over a month ago, from a lawyer<br />
claiming to represent the estate of some distant branch of Michael's family,<br />
was bewildering enough in itself... but then the sudden whirlwind of<br />
planning and decisions, legal details and travel arrangements, the packing<br />
up and shipping away of your entire home, your entire life...<br />
<br />
Now suddenly here you are, after driving for the past two days straight,<br />
over a thousand miles away from the familiar warmth of Texas, getting<br />
ready to move into the ancestral mansion of a clan of relatives so far<br />
removed that not even Michael has ever heard of them. And you've only<br />
been married since June and none of this was any of your idea in the first<br />
place, and already it's starting to rain.<br />
<br />
These days, you often find yourself feeling confused and uprooted.<br />
<br />
You shake yourself and force the melancholy thoughts from your head,<br />
trying to focus on the errand at hand. You're to meet with the real estate<br />
agent and pick up the keys to your new house while Michael runs across town<br />
to take care of some paperwork at the university. He'll be back to pick you up<br />
in a few minutes, and then the two of you can begin the long, precarious<br />
process of settling in.<br />
<br />
A sullen belch emanates from the clouds, and the rain starts coming down<br />
harder -- fat, cold drops smacking loudly against the cobblestones.<br />
Shouldn't it be snowing in New England at this time of year? With a sigh,<br />
you open your umbrella.<br />
<br />
Welcome to Anchorhead...<br />
<br />
[&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * THE FIRST DAY *<br />
<br />
I was far from home, and the spell of the eastern<br />
sea was upon me.<br />

A grim little cul-de-sac, tucked away in a corner of the claustrophobic tangle<br />
of narrow, twisting avenues that largely constitute the older portion of<br />
Anchorhead. Like most of the streets in this city, it is ancient, shadowy, and<br />
leads essentially nowhere. The lane ends here at the real estate agent's office,<br />
which lies to the east, and winds its way back toward the center of town to the<br />
west. A narrow, garbage-choked alley opens to the southeast.<br />

<br />
Local Pub<br />
A dank, drafty old drinking hole lit by flickering, oil-burning lanterns. Smoke<br />
collects in greasy pools among the rafters, and shadows crowd thick around. The<br />
bar runs the length of the room to your right, while to the south a low doorway<br />
opens onto the street.<br />
<br />
Mill workers and fishermen occupy a few of the tables, drinking beer or puffing<br />
grimly at long-stemmed pipes. Each is wrapped in his solitude, soaking up the<br />
general miasma of dreary fatalism.<br />
<br />
The lantern sitting on the table nearest you sputters fitfully, throwing<br />
distorted shadows across the wall.<br />
<br />
<span class="prompt">&gt;</span><span class="promptline" id="line159">get lantern</span><br />No one here looks as though they'd mind if you borrowed one of these lamps.<br />
Casually, you purloin the nearest one.<br />
<br />
<span class="prompt">&gt;</span><span class="promptline" id="line163">x lantern</span><br />It's an old-fashioned hurricane lamp, with a tall glass chimney to protect it<br />
from the wind. The cotton wick burns fitfully in its reservoir of cheap oil.<br />
<br />
<span class="prompt">&gt;</span><span class="promptline" id="line167">x self</span><br />You look good, considering. A bit rattled by recent events, perhaps, but well-<br />
poised and collected, all the same.<br />
<br />
<span class="prompt">&gt;</span><span class="promptline" id="line171">inventory</span><br />You are wearing your wedding ring, your trenchcoat and your clothes; in<br />
addition, you have in your hands a lantern (providing light) and your umbrella.<br />
<br />
The pockets of your trenchcoat are empty.<br />
<br />
<span class="prompt">&gt;</span><span class="promptline" id="line177">put lantern in coat</span><br />It wouldn't be very wise to put the lantern in your pocket while it's still<br />
burning.<br />

anyone in the eye. No one, in fact, even looks up from his beer. A heavy aura of<br />
resignation -- and, it almost seems, dread -- hangs palpably over the whole<br />
crowd.<br />
<br />

tables.<br />
<br />
<span class="prompt">&gt;</span><span class="promptline" id="line204">look under table</span><br />Some forgetful soul has left a flask underneath one of the tables, pushed into a<br />
shadowy corner.<br />
<br />
<span class="prompt">&gt;</span><span class="promptline" id="line208">get flask</span><br />You pick up the flask. The label is faded and mostly peeled away, but what<br />
little you can make out seems to indicate that this is not a particularly<br />
distinguished brand of spirits. The words &quot;bootleg&quot; and &quot;rotgut&quot; come to mind,<br />
probably because they are the only words legible on what's left of the label.<br />
<br />
<span class="prompt">&gt;</span><span class="promptline" id="line214">put flask in coat</span><br />You slip the flask into the pocket of your trenchcoat.<br />

rooftops on either side of the street practically touch each other. To the<br />
south, a side street leads across Whateley Bridge toward the center of town, and<br />
a twisting lane leads up a hill to the northwest. A short flight of steps to the<br />
north leads down to the local watering hole.<br />

out the vaulted rooftops of the university.<br />

represents this benighted town's single, if somewhat dubious, claim to cultural<br />
achievement. Founded some time in the early 1800s, the school's reputation and<br />
enrollment have diminished somewhat as Anchorhead drifts further and further<br />
into the abyss of provincial backwaterism. Still, it is generally recognized for<br />
its collection of folklore and esoteric mythology (one of the oldest and most<br />
extensive on the east coast). The Board of Deans was also kind enough to offer<br />
Michael a full professorship upon hearing of his recently discovered heritage<br />
and his plans to move into the estate. Ivory tower, perhaps, but at least they<br />
take care of their own.<br />
<br />
There are numerous buildings surrounding this cobbled court, but the only one<br />
you are interested in is the library to the west, where Michael told you he'd be<br />
until he came back to the real estate agent's office to pick you up. Which,<br />
incidentally, he has not yet done.<br />

<br />
Library<br />
Shadows roost thickly in the vaulted ceiling, and small, green-shaded desk lamps<br />
cast pools of warm radiance here and there around the library's dim interior.<br />
You pause a moment to let the hushed peacefulness of this place soak in -- a<br />
welcome relief from the unsettling events of the day. An exit lies east, and a<br />
small alcove to the north houses the circulation counter.<br />
<br />
Peering through the shadows, you spot your husband sitting at one of the reading<br />
desks, absorbed in some sort of weighty tome and clearly oblivious to the time.<br />
<br />
<span class="prompt">&gt;</span><span class="promptline" id="line269">x lamps</span><br />The lamps have curved, brass stands and frosted green shades; the kind of thing<br />
you'd expect to see on an accountant's desk in the 1930s.<br />

The reading lamp is currently switched on.<br />

right.<br />

At the moment, Michael is largely absorbed in his reading, and is paying little<br />
attention to you.<br />

sheepishly.<br />

stacks -- all the more esoteric and mysterious volumes from the university's<br />
collection. If anything, the area behind the counter is even more shadowy than<br />
the side you're on. The main reading area lies south.<br />
<br />
Hanging on the wall next to the counter is a small, printed sign. Beneath the<br />
sign sits a heavy, dog-eared register, and sitting next to the register is a<br />
bell.<br />

<a href="#r_linkto899" class="roomname" id="line899">Chilly Avenue</a><br />Perhaps it is merely the effect of some unwholesome vapour rising from the murky<br />
waters of the nearby Miskaton, but the temperature along this street seems<br />
perceptibly cooler than normal, even for a New England autumn. Two dirt roads<br />
lead south and southwest, into the dense woods at the edge of town.<br />
<br />
A clammy mist hangs thickly in the air, seeping through your clothes and making<br />
you shiver.<br />

Scenic View<br />
The treeline falls away on the north side of this northwest-northeast bend in<br />
the road, giving way to a panoramic view of the Miskaton River Valley and the<br />
grubby little town of Anchorhead nestled within it. From here you can see the<br />
paper mill almost directly to the north; the solitary lighthouse and surrounding<br />
ocean to the northeast; and the dilapidated stone church below you to the east.<br />
Winding through it all is the oily black ribbon of the Miskaton, and almost<br />
directly in the center lies the little clearing of Town Square. You can just<br />
make out the shape of the obelisk from here.<br />

<a href="#r_linkto931" class="roomname" id="line931">Outside the House</a><br />The lane runs up from the southeast and ends at a wide clearing surrounded by<br />
gnarled and ancient trees. A wide, curving driveway runs up to the front door of<br />
your house, which lies north.<br />
<br />
The fabled Verlac family mansion looms before you in the gloom, its dark<br />
creaking presence dominating the clearing and, somehow, even though it is not<br />
visible through the trees, the entire valley. The foreboding shadow of the<br />
Verlacs seems to enshroud all of Anchorhead from here.<br />
<br />
A typewritten notice has been attached to the front door.<br />

Michael hurries to catch up.<br />

Foyer<br />
Although it appears spacious from the outside, the house's interior feels<br />
cramped and gloomy. The walls seem too close together; the ceiling is too high.<br />
The doorways, leading in several directions, are narrow and filled with shadows,<br />
and the stairs leading up to the second floor are steep and rickety. This is not<br />
a house that makes you feel welcome. It is a house that makes you feel tiny and<br />
timid, and afraid of dark places. It is a house that makes you feel alone.<br />
<br />
The front door stands open to the south.<br />
<br />
Carelessly stacked in a towering heap in the middle of the room are all your<br />
luggage and belongings, which you had sent ahead through a moving company before<br />
driving up to Massachusetts. Everything you own is boxed away and piled up in<br />
the middle of the floor. The reality of this move finally slams home as you<br />
stare at the sprawling jumble of stuff, and suddenly you feel very lost and<br />
adrift.<br />
<br />
Night has now undeniably fallen, and the house is very, very dark. There is<br />
probably just enough residual ambience to feel your way upstairs to the bedroom,<br />
but the rest of the house is a tenebrous maze of shadows, and any exploring<br />
would probably best be done in the morning.<br />
<br />
Michael strolls along after you.<br />
<br />
Michael stretches his arms and yawns. &quot;Well,&quot; he says, &quot;I think I'm going to<br />
turn in. There'll be plenty of time to unpack and explore tomorrow. Good night,<br />
hon.&quot; He kisses you on the cheek. &quot;Don't stay up too late.&quot;<br />
<br />
And with that, he goes upstairs.<br />
<br />
A cold, noiseless draft coils through the narrow entrance hall. You shiver,<br />
wondering where it came from.<br />

so, as much as you would like to relax and enjoy the comforts of a fully<br />
furnished historical New England estate, you can't help but be put off by the<br />
shady aura surrounding the family that used to live here. The last of the line,<br />

<br />
<br />
You are waiting in your bed, with the coverlet up under your chin, waiting for<br />
Father to come tuck you in. Footsteps in the hall pause outside your door. You<br />
close your eyes; when you open them again Father is standing at the foot of the<br />
bed. His eyes are bloodshot, rimmed with red, and you wonder if he has been<br />
crying. Slowly, he starts to take off his belt.<br />
<br />
Only it's not your father after all, it's Michael. He hands you a golden sphere<br />
and says:<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't know what it opens yet but I have an idea.&quot;<br />
<br />
Your reflection is like a little doll trapped inside the sphere. Everything is<br />
tinged with gold. Your face swells and stretches comically as you stare back at<br />
yourself through the curved, distorting walls. Reaching out, your fingers curve<br />
back on themselves... the wall breaks and...<br />
<br />
You are running from the eyes, the terrible red-rimmed eyes, through endless,<br />
narrow corridors of wooden slats and crumbling plaster. You stumble through turn<br />
after turn, hopelessly lost. There is a small hole in the boards -- peering<br />
through it you see Michael in the study, typing diligently away. You scream, you<br />
pound on the wall, but he can't hear you. The red-rimmed eyes draw closer;<br />
hurrying down a twisting passage you find a dead end... the wall breaks and...<br />
<br />
Outside, you stand at another dead end, a high brick wall at the end of a steep,<br />
twisting lane. Written in black spraypaint...<br />
<br />
He always returns to his blood.<br />
<br />
Behind you, you hear the buzzing of a fly. You turn...<br />
<br />
[&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * THE SECOND DAY *<br />

It is hard to prevent the impression<br />
of a faint, malign odour about the village<br />
street, as of the massed mould and decay of<br />
centuries. It is always a relief to get<br />

CHURCH CLOSED, PREACHER SUSPECT IN<br />
COMMUNIST CRACKDOWN<br />
<br />
The&nbsp;&nbsp;Church of Celestial Wisdom<br />
in&nbsp;&nbsp;Anchorhead, Massachusetts&nbsp;&nbsp;was<br />
shut&nbsp;&nbsp;down&nbsp;&nbsp;and&nbsp;&nbsp;its&nbsp;&nbsp;congregation<br />
disbanded&nbsp;&nbsp;yesterday&nbsp;&nbsp; after&nbsp;&nbsp; its<br />
pastor,&nbsp;&nbsp;the Rev. Mordecai Verlac,<br />
70, was&nbsp;&nbsp;accused&nbsp;&nbsp;of&nbsp;&nbsp;distributing<br />
Communist propaganda to&nbsp;&nbsp;his pari-<br />
shioners.&nbsp;&nbsp;Authorities&nbsp;&nbsp;in&nbsp;&nbsp;Arkham<br />
were informed by an anonymous call<br />
two days earlier.<br />
&quot;The caller&nbsp;&nbsp;told&nbsp;&nbsp;us&nbsp;&nbsp;that the<br />
Reverend&nbsp;&nbsp;was&nbsp;&nbsp;'preaching not from<br />
the Good Book, but from a terrible<br />
book,'&nbsp;&nbsp;and that he had been warn-<br />
ing&nbsp;&nbsp;them&nbsp;&nbsp; about&nbsp;&nbsp;some&nbsp;&nbsp; kind&nbsp;&nbsp;of<br />
'invasion'&nbsp;&nbsp;or&nbsp;&nbsp;'great event' that<br />
would&nbsp;&nbsp;be&nbsp;&nbsp;happening&nbsp;&nbsp;soon,&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;said<br />
Sgt. Biedermeyer&nbsp;&nbsp;of&nbsp;&nbsp;the&nbsp;&nbsp; Arkham<br />
Police Department. &quot;It smelled Red<br />
to me,&nbsp;&nbsp;so I made&nbsp;&nbsp;the decision to<br />
call our HUAC representative up in<br />
Salem.&quot;<br />
The&nbsp;&nbsp;raid&nbsp;&nbsp; commenced&nbsp;&nbsp; shortly<br />
after&nbsp;&nbsp;morning&nbsp;&nbsp;services&nbsp;&nbsp;began at<br />
8:00&nbsp;&nbsp;am,&nbsp;&nbsp;in&nbsp;&nbsp;order to confiscate<br />
printed&nbsp;&nbsp;material&nbsp;&nbsp;and&nbsp;&nbsp;catch&nbsp;&nbsp;any<br />
possible accomplices&nbsp;&nbsp;before&nbsp;&nbsp;they<br />
could hide or destroy evidence. No<br />
officers&nbsp;&nbsp;who participated&nbsp;&nbsp;in the<br />
raid&nbsp;&nbsp;were available for&nbsp;&nbsp;comment,<br />
although one man coming out of the<br />
building afterwards&nbsp;&nbsp;was allegedly<br />
overheard saying that it was&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;the<br />
worst thing he'd ever seen.&quot;<br />
The&nbsp;&nbsp;Church of Celestial Wisdom<br />
was founded in 1860&nbsp;&nbsp;by&nbsp;&nbsp;Rev. Ver-<br />
lac's grandfather,&nbsp;&nbsp;the&nbsp;&nbsp;notorious<br />
orator and painter&nbsp;&nbsp;Elijah Verlac.<br />

by many to be&nbsp;&nbsp;a&nbsp;&nbsp;historical land-<br />

Any information regarding the whereabouts of Daryl Beasley, age 9, should be<br />
reported immediately to the Anchorhead police. Daryl was last seen by his mother<br />
after she dropped him off at the Route 20 bus stop, just north of Old Mill Town<br />

scheduled stop at 8:36 am.<br />
<br />
Daryl is 4'10&quot; tall, of slight build, with brown hair and brown eyes. At the<br />
time of his disappearance, he was wearing brown corduroy pants, blue sneakers,<br />

PAINTING SELLS FOR 1000£, SIGHT<br />
UNSEEN<br />
<br />
The&nbsp;&nbsp;infamous&nbsp;&nbsp;mystic&nbsp;&nbsp;Aleister<br />
Crowley purchased a painting at an<br />
auction&nbsp;&nbsp;at&nbsp;&nbsp; Sotheby's&nbsp;&nbsp;for&nbsp;&nbsp;1000<br />
pounds sterling on Monday&nbsp;&nbsp;without<br />
so much&nbsp;&nbsp;as glancing&nbsp;&nbsp;at&nbsp;&nbsp;it.&nbsp;&nbsp;The<br />
painting,&nbsp;&nbsp;entitled&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;The Legacy&quot;,<br />
is&nbsp;&nbsp;by&nbsp;&nbsp;the&nbsp;&nbsp;late&nbsp;&nbsp;American Elijah<br />
Verlac,&nbsp;&nbsp;and&nbsp;&nbsp;was sold&nbsp;&nbsp;along with<br />
numerous&nbsp;&nbsp; other&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;pieces&nbsp;&nbsp; by&nbsp;&nbsp;a<br />
representative&nbsp;&nbsp; of&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the&nbsp;&nbsp;Verlac<br />
estate.<br />
Crowley&nbsp;&nbsp;reportedly strode into<br />
the&nbsp;&nbsp;auction&nbsp;&nbsp; room&nbsp;&nbsp;wearing&nbsp;&nbsp;full<br />
ceremonial robes&nbsp;&nbsp;and&nbsp;&nbsp;immediately<br />
bid 1000£ -- well&nbsp;&nbsp;over&nbsp;&nbsp;twice the<br />
going bid.&nbsp;&nbsp;He ordered it&nbsp;&nbsp;wrapped<br />
and transported immediately to his<br />
home.&nbsp;&nbsp;It&nbsp;&nbsp;is&nbsp;&nbsp;not&nbsp;&nbsp;known&nbsp;&nbsp;whether<br />
Crowley had ever seen the painting<br />
before arriving at the auction.<br />
&quot;I've&nbsp;&nbsp;never seen anything like<br />
it,&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;said&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir Walton&nbsp;&nbsp;Radcliffe,<br />
Esq., presiding auctioneer for the<br />
Verlac exhibit, &quot;but I suppose one<br />
might&nbsp;&nbsp;expect such behavior from a<br />
person&nbsp;&nbsp;who&nbsp;&nbsp;calls&nbsp;&nbsp;himself,&nbsp;&nbsp;'The<br />
Great Beast'.&quot;<br />
Mordecai&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Verlac,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elijah's<br />
grandson&nbsp;&nbsp;and&nbsp;&nbsp; executor&nbsp;&nbsp; of&nbsp;&nbsp;the<br />
Verlac estate,&nbsp;&nbsp;was not present at<br />
the&nbsp;&nbsp;auction.&nbsp;&nbsp;Crowley&nbsp;&nbsp;has stated<br />
that he&nbsp;&nbsp;has&nbsp;&nbsp;never&nbsp;&nbsp;met&nbsp;&nbsp;Mordecai<br />
Verlac&nbsp;&nbsp;and has&nbsp;&nbsp;no desire&nbsp;&nbsp;to. &quot;I<br />
encountered&nbsp;&nbsp;Verlac&nbsp;&nbsp;in&nbsp;&nbsp;a&nbsp;&nbsp;former<br />
life,&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;he is reported&nbsp;&nbsp;as saying,<br />
&quot;and I would not&nbsp;&nbsp;do so again&nbsp;&nbsp;for<br />
all the kingdoms in Hades.&nbsp;&nbsp;He has<br />
gone where I dare not.&quot;<br />

BONES DISCOVERED IN WOODS, CHILD<br />
FEARED DEAD<br />
<br />
The&nbsp;&nbsp;bones&nbsp;&nbsp; of&nbsp;&nbsp; what&nbsp;&nbsp; police<br />
believe&nbsp;&nbsp;to&nbsp;&nbsp;be a small child were<br />

Police&nbsp;&nbsp;have&nbsp;&nbsp;drawn no conclusions<br />
as&nbsp;&nbsp;yet,&nbsp;&nbsp;but&nbsp;&nbsp;there&nbsp;&nbsp;is&nbsp;&nbsp;a strong<br />
suspicion&nbsp;&nbsp;that&nbsp;&nbsp;the&nbsp;&nbsp;bones may be<br />
the&nbsp;&nbsp;remains&nbsp;&nbsp;of Christopher Till-<br />
worth,&nbsp;&nbsp;who&nbsp;&nbsp;disappeared near that<br />
area two weeks ago.<br />
Sgt. Ronald&nbsp;&nbsp;Franklin&nbsp;&nbsp;of&nbsp;&nbsp; the<br />
Arkham&nbsp;&nbsp;police was not optimistic.<br />
&quot;We&nbsp;&nbsp; have&nbsp;&nbsp;contacted&nbsp;&nbsp; the&nbsp;&nbsp;boy's<br />
mother,&nbsp;&nbsp;and are trying to prepare<br />
her&nbsp;&nbsp;for&nbsp;&nbsp;the worst,&quot; he said. &quot;No<br />
one&nbsp;&nbsp;here&nbsp;&nbsp;wants&nbsp;&nbsp;to&nbsp;&nbsp;give up hope<br />
prematurely,&nbsp;&nbsp; but&nbsp;&nbsp; the&nbsp;&nbsp; general<br />
feeling&nbsp;&nbsp;here is,&nbsp;&nbsp;we've found the<br />
boy.&quot;<br />
The remains, which consisted of<br />
a femur&nbsp;&nbsp;and&nbsp;&nbsp;partial&nbsp;&nbsp;skull,&nbsp;&nbsp;are<br />
being shipped to a forensic lab in<br />
Boston&nbsp;&nbsp; for&nbsp;&nbsp; further&nbsp;&nbsp; analysis.<br />
Rumors that&nbsp;&nbsp;the&nbsp;&nbsp;bones&nbsp;&nbsp;displayed<br />
teeth marks consistent with animal<br />
bites are so far unsubstantiated.<br />
Christopher,&nbsp;&nbsp;who&nbsp;&nbsp;would&nbsp;&nbsp;have<br />
turned 7 on the 19th, is the fifth<br />
child&nbsp;&nbsp;to&nbsp;&nbsp;disappear&nbsp;&nbsp;in&nbsp;&nbsp;the last<br />

ANTHROPOLOGIST TURNED AWAY IN<br />
PROPERTY DISPUTE<br />
<br />
Prominent&nbsp;&nbsp;anthropologist&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr.<br />
Joseph Corbin's&nbsp;&nbsp;repeated attempts<br />
to secure permission&nbsp;&nbsp;to set up an<br />
archeological&nbsp;&nbsp; dig&nbsp;&nbsp; in&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;nearby<br />
Anchorhead&nbsp;&nbsp;came to an end yester-<br />
day&nbsp;&nbsp;when he lost his suit against<br />
the Rev. Mordecai Verlac. The case<br />
has&nbsp;&nbsp;been&nbsp;&nbsp;pending&nbsp;&nbsp;for&nbsp;&nbsp;over&nbsp;&nbsp;six<br />
months.<br />
The&nbsp;&nbsp;Rev. Verlac&nbsp;&nbsp;has&nbsp;&nbsp;strongly<br />
disputed&nbsp;&nbsp;Corbin's right to dig in<br />
the area, contending that the land<br />
in&nbsp;&nbsp; question&nbsp;&nbsp; belongs&nbsp;&nbsp; to&nbsp;&nbsp; the<br />
ancestral&nbsp;&nbsp;Verlac&nbsp;&nbsp;estate&nbsp;&nbsp;and&nbsp;&nbsp;is<br />
therefore&nbsp;&nbsp;his&nbsp;&nbsp;private&nbsp;&nbsp;property.<br />
Last week,&nbsp;&nbsp;Rev. Verlac's&nbsp;&nbsp;lawyers<br />
presented conclusive&nbsp;&nbsp;evidence&nbsp;&nbsp;of<br />
prior&nbsp;&nbsp;ownership,&nbsp;&nbsp;and&nbsp;&nbsp;the&nbsp;&nbsp;judge<br />
quickly ruled in his favor.<br />
Dr. Corbin,&nbsp;&nbsp;who&nbsp;&nbsp;is&nbsp;&nbsp;a protégé<br />
and&nbsp;&nbsp;close personal friend&nbsp;&nbsp;of the<br />
noted folklorist&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr. J. Arnsworth<br />
Frazer,&nbsp;&nbsp;hoped to discover&nbsp;&nbsp;relics<br />
of&nbsp;&nbsp; the&nbsp;&nbsp; little-known&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Misquat<br />

to have&nbsp;&nbsp;inhabited this area&nbsp;&nbsp;cen-<br />
turies prior&nbsp;&nbsp;to European&nbsp;&nbsp;settle-<br />
ment.&nbsp;&nbsp;Corbin called&nbsp;&nbsp;the decision<br />
&quot;a travesty&quot;.<br />

by&nbsp;&nbsp; Miskaton University&nbsp;&nbsp;to rally<br />

into the night yesterday, battling<br />
a blaze that brought&nbsp;&nbsp;Anchorhead's<br />
historic paper mill&nbsp;&nbsp;to the ground<br />
despite their best efforts.<br />
The mill,&nbsp;&nbsp;which&nbsp;&nbsp;provides jobs<br />
for&nbsp;&nbsp;roughly&nbsp;&nbsp; two-thirds&nbsp;&nbsp;of&nbsp;&nbsp;the<br />
town's&nbsp;&nbsp;population,&nbsp;&nbsp; caught&nbsp;&nbsp;fire<br />
yesterday around 4:00 pm. Although<br />
there&nbsp;&nbsp;have been rumors&nbsp;&nbsp;of an ex-<br />
plosion,&nbsp;&nbsp;the&nbsp;&nbsp;exact cause&nbsp;&nbsp;of the<br />
fire remains unknown.<br />
Fire Inspector Donald Brown re-<br />
mains puzzled.&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;There is evidence<br />
of chemical burns&nbsp;&nbsp;that are incon-<br />
sistent with the materials used in<br />
paper&nbsp;&nbsp;manufacture,&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;he&nbsp;&nbsp;told re-<br />
porters. &quot;There's metal fused with<br />
metal in there...&nbsp;&nbsp;it's all messed<br />
up.&quot;<br />
Interestingly,&nbsp;&nbsp;this is not the<br />
first time the Anchorhead mill has<br />
burned.&nbsp;&nbsp; The&nbsp;&nbsp;original&nbsp;&nbsp;mill&nbsp;&nbsp;was<br />
built&nbsp;&nbsp;by&nbsp;&nbsp;Wilhelm&nbsp;&nbsp;Verlac&nbsp;&nbsp;in the<br />
latter&nbsp;&nbsp;part of&nbsp;&nbsp;the 17th century,<br />
and&nbsp;&nbsp;historical&nbsp;&nbsp;records&nbsp;&nbsp;indicate<br />
that it burned down after only ten<br />
years.&nbsp;&nbsp;The&nbsp;&nbsp;mill&nbsp;&nbsp;was&nbsp;&nbsp;rebuilt by<br />
Wilhelm's grandson,&nbsp;&nbsp;Heinrich Ver-<br />
lac,&nbsp;&nbsp;a&nbsp;&nbsp;few&nbsp;&nbsp;decades&nbsp;&nbsp;later. This<br />
one&nbsp;&nbsp;lasted&nbsp;&nbsp;until shortly&nbsp;&nbsp;before<br />
the&nbsp;&nbsp;Civil War&nbsp;&nbsp;--&nbsp;&nbsp;and some still<br />
hold&nbsp;&nbsp;that it was&nbsp;&nbsp;burned down&nbsp;&nbsp;by<br />
Confederate sympathizers.<br />
The&nbsp;&nbsp;current&nbsp;&nbsp;mill was&nbsp;&nbsp;rebuilt<br />
in 1922 by Heinrich's great-great-<br />
grandson,&nbsp;&nbsp;Rev.&nbsp;&nbsp;Mordecai&nbsp;&nbsp;Verlac.<br />
Mordecai,&nbsp;&nbsp;in addition&nbsp;&nbsp;to being a<br />
fiery preacher&nbsp;&nbsp;and outspoken Pro-<br />
hibitionist, was quite wealthy and<br />
owned numerous&nbsp;&nbsp;and widespread in-<br />
vestments.&nbsp;&nbsp;At the age of 70, this<br />
controversial&nbsp;&nbsp;figure&nbsp;&nbsp;was accused<br />

It is with great joy&nbsp;&nbsp;that Gwyneth<br />

ment of their only daughter, JULIA<br />
GWENDOLYN&nbsp;&nbsp;WARD,&nbsp;&nbsp; to&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr.&nbsp;&nbsp;EDWARD<br />
PHILLIP&nbsp;&nbsp;VERLAC.&nbsp;&nbsp; Edward&nbsp;&nbsp; is&nbsp;&nbsp;an<br />

Miskaton University in Anchorhead,<br />
Massachusetts;&nbsp;&nbsp; Julia&nbsp;&nbsp; plans&nbsp;&nbsp;to<br />
attend&nbsp;&nbsp;medical&nbsp;&nbsp;school&nbsp;&nbsp;at Arkham<br />
College.&nbsp;&nbsp;They&nbsp;&nbsp;plan&nbsp;&nbsp;a&nbsp;&nbsp;late June<br />
wedding. We wish them good fortune<br />
and long happiness in their union.<br />
<br />
(The announcement is dated December 12, 1984, and is accompanied by a picture of<br />
the young couple. She has long, dark hair and a serious expression; he, although<br />
only in his twenties, is already starting to bald a little. You find yourself<br />
unable to tear your eyes away from his face for some time. It seems open and<br />
guileless, and he is clearly very happy. There is no hint there of the nightmare<br />
his world would one day become.)<br />

Storage<br />
Old crates and boxes piled high against the walls make this room seem even<br />
smaller and dingier than it actually is, which is saying a lot. A doorway lies<br />
north; the other walls contain nothing but shadows and dirt-filled corners.<br />
<br />
You can see an old-fashioned iron key here.<br />

The pockets of your trenchcoat contain a keyring, on which are three keys (an<br />

sagging timbers creak uneasily above your head. Ancient, frayed wiring festoons<br />
the ceiling like some strange species of clinging vine. Portions of the cellar<br />
extend south and east into the clammy darkness, though you could always beat a<br />

One scene in particular catches your eye.<br />
<br />
<span class="prompt">&gt;</span><span class="promptline" id="line2298">x scene</span><br />A young apprentice butcher learns his trade in a slaughterhouse. The older man<br />
-- heavyset, thick jaw and sloping brow -- holds his cleaver above a severed<br />
calf's head, looking expectantly at the boy as though demonstrating the proper<br />
technique. The boy, holding a smaller cleaver of his own, looks on attentively.<br />
It would be reminiscent of something by Norman Rockwell, except for the frankly<br />
alarming amount of gore. The aprons and faces of both master and apprentice are<br />
streaked with blood; blood pools on the chopping block and overspills the<br />
gutters; blood drips from the walls and from the skinned carcasses that can be<br />
seen hanging in the background. The two butchers stand ankle-deep in a reeking<br />
abattoir.<br />
<br />
And... there's something wrong with the boy. Most of his body is hidden behind<br />
the chopping block, but there are details about the parts you can see that...<br />
don't seem to fit quite right. The arm holding the cleaver is slightly<br />
misshapen, for example, the fingers deformed in a way that you can't quite make<br />
out. And his neck seems just a bit too thick, and his head seems just a bit too<br />
large and blocky. His face looks normal enough, except that it seems to have<br />
been placed just slightly off-center. It's a very subtly disturbing effect.<br />

<br />
<span class="prompt">&gt;</span><span class="promptline" id="line2353">x scene</span><br />A group of primitive tribesmen dance within a ring of standing stones, beneath a<br />
lightning-streaked sky. Their dress and some of the fetishes they carry --<br />
feathers, rattles, ceremonial masks -- all seem to represent a Native American<br />
culture, but the men themselves are... strange. They look truly savage and<br />
degenerate, in a way that you don't often see Native Americans depicted. Peering<br />
closely, you can see that some of them even appear to be deformed.<br />
<br />
Overlooking the dance stands a tall obelisk on a hill, silhouetted against the<br />
storm clouds above. The artist added a strange effect to the cloud formations<br />
directly above the obelisk; the color and shading seem to suggest a red, baleful<br />
eye looking down upon the strange ritual below.<br />
<br />
You shake yourself suddenly, and realize you've been staring intently at the<br />
painting for minutes on end. You step back and rub your tired eyes. When you<br />
look again, however, the picture you were just examining is no longer in front<br />
of you. None of the other paintings have moved as far as you can tell, but that<br />

century clothing; they jeer and throw stones. The ringleader, standing in front<br />
of the five glowing pyres with the smoking torch still in his hand, wears a<br />
clergyman's collar.<br />
<br />
The artist obviously went to painstaking lengths to depict the burning in<br />
ghastly detail: skin curling away from blackened flesh; hair shriveling; eyes<br />
boiling in their sockets and melting across cracked and splitting cheeks...<br />
repeated five times over, on the bodies of five thrashing, screaming girls. It<br />

<a href="#r_linkto2549" class="roomname" id="line2549">Sitting Room</a><br />The east wall is occupied by a beautiful antique sofa, and a large, hand-woven<br />
rug covers the hardwood floor. The huge marble fireplace in the north wall helps<br />
complete the impression of comfort and warmth, and for a moment or two you can<br />
almost think of this place as somewhere you could live, as opposed to merely<br />
somewhere others have died. The foyer lies west, and a doorway to the left of<br />
the fireplace leads north.<br />
<br />
Your brief sense of comfort quickly drains away, however, as you become aware of<br />
the icy and maniacal stare emanating from the great portrait hanging over the<br />
mantelpiece. Under the malefic gaze of those red-rimmed eyes, the most<br />
comforting thought you can muster is that of immediate flight.<br />
<br />
On the sofa is a family album.<br />
<br />
<span class="prompt">&gt;</span><span class="promptline" id="line2564">get album</span><br />You pick up the family album. It's a slim, hardbound volume in dark leather,<br />
unadorned except for name &quot;Verlac&quot; embossed on the front. Glancing at the title<br />
page, you notice two details: one, the book was self-published; and two, it was<br />
published in 1944. So it's a good bet that Edward Verlac and his family aren't<br />
mentioned here.<br />
<br />
<span class="prompt">&gt;</span><span class="promptline" id="line2571">read album</span><br />The book contains portraits and brief biographies (although, strangely, no birth<br />
or death dates) on some two hundred members of the Verlac clan, from the central<br />
family figures to the distant second cousins. If you want to read about someone<br />
in here, you'll have to look them up by name.<br />

to Anchorhead in 1663; elected mayor of Anchorhead in 1690; built the Miskaton<br />
River Mill in 1695; began construction of the lighthouse in 1706.<br />
<br />
The picture is a reproduction of a charcoal sketch, probably done when he was a<br />
younger man. The similarities to the portrait in the sitting room is evident,<br />
though: the patrician nose; the harsh, thin line of the mouth; the lean, wolfish<br />
jaw. It is the eyes, however, that carry the true family resemblance. Even in<br />
the rough, colorless strokes of charcoal, you can see that they are edged with<br />
the same raw madness that haunts the red-tinged gaze of the sitting room<br />
portrait.<br />
<br />
<span class="prompt">&gt;</span><span class="promptline" id="line2593">look up heinrich in album</span><br />The entry reads:<br />
<br />
Heinrich Verlac<br />
Added cupola to the Verlac Estate in 1759; elected mayor of Anchorhead in<br />
1765; rebuilt the Miskaton River Mill in 1770; led the battle of Quattac Bend in<br />
the Misquat Uprising of 1772; arrested as a Royalist sympathizer in 1777 but<br />
subsequently cleared of all charges; completed construction of the lighthouse in<br />
1795.<br />
<br />
The portrait is of Heinrich as an older man, in his late fifties, perhaps. The<br />
German ancestry shows through more clearly here, in the set of his jaw and the<br />
line of his forehead. The eyes burn with aggressive pride... and perhaps a<br />
little of the madness which stained the gaze of his ancestors as well.<br />
<br />
<span class="prompt">&gt;</span><span class="promptline" id="line2608">look up elijah in album</span><br />The entry reads:<br />
<br />
Elijah Verlac<br />
Traveled to Europe in 1824 to study painting and to research the Verlac<br />
genealogy; returned to Anchorhead in 1832; entered the seminary at Arkham<br />
College in 1834; ordained in 1844; began construction of the Church of Celestial<br />
Wisdom in Anchorhead in 1860; accused of Confederate sympathies in 1862; retired<br />
from the clergy and devoted life to painting in 1873.<br />
<br />
On of the earliest photographic portraits in the album, it depicts a man in his<br />
sixties, at least. His face is deeply scored by time, his skin mottled with<br />
liver spots, his long, gray hair swept back from a high, bony forehead. This man<br />
resembles the portrait in the sitting room more than any of the others, for he<br />
has practically the same eyes -- the raw, bloodshot madness staring out from<br />
hollow caves in his skull.<br />
<br />
You note one other interesting detail: he appears to have an extra digit, a<br />
sixth finger, on his right hand.<br />

rebuilt the Miskaton River Mill in 1922.<br />
<br />
The photograph depicts a man who has returned to his Puritan roots: dressed in<br />
spartan black, hair clipped in an archaic tonsure, clutching a Bible in his lap<br />
as he glares stoically at the camera. This is the kind of man who would whip his<br />
children for laughing on Sunday. His eyes still carry the Verlac madness,<br />
burning with single-minded righteousness.<br />

then returned with son in 1663; died 1686.<br />
<br />
The woman in the portrait is strikingly beautiful, with jet black hair that<br />
hangs down past her shoulders like a shining, velvet curtain. There is some<br />
resemblance to the thin, cruel features of her father, but not the ragged, red-<br />
tinged madness about the eyes. Eustacia's eyes are not red at all; they are cold<br />
and deep and very dark.<br />

1622 on the ship Dawn Maiden; founded the town of Anchorhead in 1624; began<br />

Chuaquacqat of the Misquat tribe in 1631.<br />

Children's Bedroom<br />
This must be the children's bedroom. The bed is smaller than the one in the<br />
master bedroom, its bright coverlet providing one of the few feeble splashes of<br />
color in what must have been, for most of its history, a joylessly Puritan<br />
household. A small vanity table occupies the opposite wall, and in the corner<br />
under the window stands an ancient crib. The only exit is to the north.<br />
<br />
A child's jewelry box sits on the corner of the vanity.<br />

<span class="prompt">&gt;</span><span class="promptline" id="line2894">read pages</span><br />Carefully, you turn the tattered pages. The handwriting is that of a young girl.<br />
You idly wonder if this might have been the diary of one of Edward Verlac's<br />
daughters -- but then you notice part of a date, just visible in the corner of<br />
the page: 1953. This must have been written, then, several years before Edward<br />
was born.<br />
<br />
The entries that are legible read as follows:<br />
<br />
...Father came again to my bed last night... mother doesn't... tells me I<br />
can't... to be a good daughter. Sometimes it hurts, but Father always tells me I<br />
shouldn't cry. Father says a daughter must do her Duty if she wants to get into<br />
Heaven. And I do want to get into Heaven...<br />
<br />
[this entry dated 1957] ...my poor little William. Father calls him an<br />
aberration, child of the Devil, but I don't believe... locked in the attic. I go<br />
to see him whenever Father is away. I sing to him, sometimes, through the<br />
keyhole, and slip him sweets through the crack under the door... my baby is<br />
beautiful... can't let him hurt my dear baby William... to the doctor, and he<br />
has a plan... I can never... this locket, William, and I will always keep<br />
yours... to always remember my face...<br />
<br />
Nothing else is readable except for one fragmented entry near the very end of<br />
the book, the date in the corner reading February 27, 1961:<br />
<br />
...dead, but not dead yet... will not allow him to do to Edward what he wanted<br />
to do to William... have learned... given him the charm against the... never<br />
take it off, dear Edward... [a page has been torn away] ...fear to sleep... mist<br />
at the window --<br />
<br />
And that's all.<br />

Path Behind the House<br />
A gravel path starts here at the back door of the house, and marks a trail<br />
nearly overgrown by weeds and briars. It disappears into the undergrowth to the<br />
northwest, framed by crooked trees with overhanging branches that seem to form a<br />
stunted, jagged archway into the dim recesses of the forest.<br />

Family Plot<br />
Old, moss-slimed tombstones, many broken off and leaning crazily like an old<br />
man's teeth, poke up from the soft, mulchy earth. In their midst stands an<br />
ancient marble crypt, its heavy iron door nearly obscured by thick draperies of<br />
ivy. The trees press close around this quiet enclave of death, leaning together<br />
over your head as if sharing secrets. A gap in the undergrowth to the southeast<br />

his home at #11 Mill Town Road last night. Little Jeffrey is the latest victim<br />
in a series of abductions that stretches back for years, one every six months or<br />
so, and that authorities believe is the work of a single perpetrator. Local<br />
police had hoped to prove that Edward Verlac had been behind the kidnappings,<br />
but were unable to obtain a confession or any hard proof. Edward Verlac was<br />
convicted of murdering his wife and two daughters, one of whom was 15 months<br />
old, in January of this year; he was found not guilty by reason of insanity and<br />
incarcerated in Danvers Asylum, where he remained until committing suicide last<br />
March. This latest kidnapping, occurring after Edward's death, seems to have<br />
cleared up any lingering suspicions that he might have been the culprit.<br />
<br />

strongly urged to speak to the authorities as soon as possible.<br />

characters, which must have been carved very deeply in order to survive this<br />
much erosion, twist and squirm in disturbing ways, flowing into and through each<br />

achievement. Founded some time in the early 1800s, the school's reputation and<br />
enrollment have diminished somewhat as Anchorhead drifts further and further<br />

its collection of folklore and esoteric mythology (one of the oldest and most<br />
extensive on the east coast). The Board of Deans was also kind enough to offer<br />
Michael a full professorship upon hearing of his recently discovered heritage<br />

This chapter deals with the strange mythology surrounding the person of Croseus<br />
Verlac, the first of the American Verlacs, who immigrated from the Black Forest<br />
region of Germany in the early 1600s. He settled in the Miskaton Valley and<br />
there helped establish the small fishing port soon to be known as Anchorhead.<br />
<br />
Croseus sired six raven-haired daughters and schooled all of them at home. The<br />
girls were reclusive and odd of habit, and by the time the eldest turned fifteen<br />
the town had all but openly accused them of witchcraft. The townsfolk shunned<br />
the Verlac daughters and called them &quot;the Old Man's Coven&quot; -- although never<br />
within earshot, since Croseus was already a very powerful and influential man in<br />
that region.<br />
<br />
Although he never had a son, Croseus apparently sired a number of grandsons by<br />
more than one of his daughters -- ostensibly to keep the Verlac blood pure, such<br />
practice being not uncommon in the more secluded and xenophobic early<br />
settlements. However, most of the male children were born dead, or horribly<br />
deformed, or both, and there were furtive whispers that Croseus was practicing<br />
some form of dark sorcery on his progeny. The fact that Croseus fell ill on the<br />
day that the first healthy male child was born (to his youngest daughter), and<br />
died before day's end, did not go unnoticed.<br />
<br />
After Croseus died, the townspeople turned against the &quot;coven&quot;, burning all of<br />
them to death except for Eustacia, the youngest, who managed to escape along<br />
with her infant son, Wilhelm. She returned some years later, after an outbreak<br />
of smallpox wiped out much of the town's older population, including the<br />
Calvinist minister and every last man and woman who had participated in the<br />
burning of Verlac's brood.<br />
<br />
With a start, you remember the pattern you uncovered in the city archives --<br />
each Verlac dying on the very day his grandson is born... no parents listed on<br />
the birth certificates... no marriage records, only sons then daughters then<br />
sons... and a sickening, horrifying thought begins to take shape: what if the<br />
foul tradition begun by Croseus Verlac did not end with his death?<br />
<br />
What if, for centuries, the Verlacs have been raping their own daughters in<br />
order to sire grandsons?<br />
<br />
What in God's name was wrong with this family? How could this have gone on for<br />
so long without anyone knowing about it or trying to stop it? And why does each<br />
Verlac die on the very day his grandson is born?<br />
<br />
Edward Verlac, the man from whom Michael inherited the house and all its<br />
madness, must have been the last of his line, the child of his mother and his<br />
mother's own father. He went insane and killed his entire family, and now his<br />
legacy has been passed on to your husband. With a sudden rush of urgency and<br />
fear, you realize that you have to get out of this town, and you have to get<br />
Michael out with you, as soon as humanly possible.<br />

Little is known about the enigmatic Misquat Indians. They are believed to have<br />
occupied a small, unobtrusive area around southeastern Massachusetts, along the<br />
banks of the river which now bears their name. At the time that this book was<br />
published, various property disputes prevented any thorough archaeological<br />
investigation of the area; information regarding this tiny, sequestered tribe is<br />
therefore scarce and based largely on hearsay and folklore.<br />
<br />
Analysis of the only known fossil -- a partial skull -- has led some<br />
anthropologists to conclude that the Misquat were not indigenous to the region.<br />
One popular theory holds that the tribe is most closely related to certain<br />
degenerate branches of the northern Esquimeaux, and were perhaps driven from<br />
their original sub-arctic clime and forced to settle in exile in what would<br />
become the northeastern United States.<br />
<br />
Although precious few physical artifacts have been recovered -- chief among them<br />
a pair of ritual masks and a crudely carved, seven-holed wind instrument -- tall<br />
tales of Misquat ritual abound. They appear to have been a unilaterally reviled<br />
tribe. Most of the whispered stories involve horrid, ululating chants around<br />
blazing bonfires in the dead of winter night, grotesque copulations performed in<br />
honor of bestial gods, and of course abundant human sacrifice. The Misquat were<br />
generally known as child-stealers, creeping through open windows at night to<br />
perpetrate foul kidnappings. None of these claims can of course be verified;<br />
nearly all Indian tribes encountered by the first European settlers have been<br />
subject to such prejudices at one time or another.<br />
<br />
It is known that the Misquat were most likely star-worshippers, and possessed<br />
what was likely a quite complex theology involving entities that dwelled beyond<br />
&quot;the bowl of tiny fires&quot; -- their term for the night sky. These entities granted<br />
wisdom or insanity, bestowed prosperity or famine, according to how well or how<br />
laxly the tribe performed its ritual appeasements. The rituals attempted to<br />
contact or possibly summon aspects of these entities through elaborately carved<br />
&quot;beacons&quot; -- mounds of stones or obelisks placed at significant geographical<br />
locations.<br />
<br />
The few eroded hieroglyphs left by them (oddly, the Misquat were one of the few<br />
North American tribes to have developed a system of writing prior to any contact<br />
with Europeans) have proved a compelling but so far intractable puzzle for<br />
linguists today; all further detail about their ritual and mythology remains yet<br />
a mystery.<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
Nearly all of the early European settlements circulated stories of a being known<br />
as &quot;The Dark Man&quot; that lived in the primordial woods beyond the settlements'<br />
borders. Deeply religious and at the same time almost hysterically<br />
superstitious, clinging precariously to the edges of an unexplored and therefore<br />
terrifying continent, it was only natural for people in those times to project<br />
their collective fears onto the unknown. For the predominantly fundamentalist<br />
Protestant sects that first colonized the New World, these projections typically<br />
were embodiments of the Christian concept of the Devil.<br />
<br />
The Dark Man generally takes the form of a man, sometimes of large or even giant<br />
stature but more often no larger than a natural human. He is invariably dark-<br />
skinned, although rarely described as a Negro -- most often he is a Caucasian<br />
with jet-black skin, thus combining the refined, cunning intelligence of the<br />
European with the base carnality of the African. He is regularly portrayed as<br />
the consort of witches. He has many names: The Dark Man, The Grinning Man, Old<br />
Scratch, Springheel Jack, The Evil One, etc., but always his formal, Biblical<br />
appellation -- &quot;Lucifer&quot; or &quot;Satan&quot; -- is scrupulously avoided, a holdover from<br />
the tradition that to speak a demon's name is to attract his attention and<br />
perhaps even summon him.<br />
<br />
More interesting to the folklorist are the names that harken further back than<br />
these simple Christian superstitions, recalling a more pagan portrayal of the<br />
dark and unknown. These tales, which originate from the more reclusive colonies,<br />
often bring out the more animalistic, nature-worshipping aspect of the Dark Man.<br />
He is sometimes pictured as being covered with hair, or having hooves instead of<br />
feet, resembling Classical images of Pan. His names are more obscure: The Wicker<br />
(or Wicca) Man; The Black Goat With A Thousand Young. Therein lie tantalizing<br />
clues offering the enterprising folklorist still deeper glimpses into the<br />
collective unconscious.<br />
<br />
A few rare instances of The Dark Man have been uncovered that point beyond even<br />
these antiquated references -- bizarre aspects that seem to reflect some of the<br />
less understood concepts of Native American mysticism. Such baroque names as<br />
&quot;The Lurker At The Threshold&quot; or &quot;The Watcher Beyond The Stars&quot; point to a<br />
substratum of human mythology as yet untouched. These versions typically<br />
describe not physical manifestations, but rather abstract concepts of Evil and<br />
Time that some scholars have linked to the pre-Roman god Saturn, before he<br />
became characterized as merely the father of Zeus, when he was instead<br />
identified with the Ouroburos Dragon, Devourer of Worlds. Hopefully, as more<br />
archaeological evidence is uncovered, we will be able to speak of these<br />
primordial connections with greater confidence.<br />

<br />
<br />
Rather unique to the lower Miskaton River Valley, this tale centers around a<br />
seemingly malevolent fog that roams the forests and lonely night roads, choking<br />
the unwary traveler with invisible, untouchable hands.<br />
<br />
The experience of being attacked by this strange entity is described in an 1855<br />
journal as: &quot;...lyke as thowe a deade man were to put his corpsey fingers downe<br />
yr throate withe one hande, &amp; up yr nostrille withe the other...&quot;<br />
<br />
No two tellings can agree on the origins of this terrible mist. Some accounts<br />
insist that it is a spirit of the restless dead; others attribute the effect to<br />
malicious hobgoblins. Other versions implicate witchcraft, a pirate's curse,<br />
swamp faerie... the list goes on. Some of the more esoteric explanations seem to<br />
indicate that the legend was adapted by white settlers from native superstitions<br />
held by the tribes indigenous to the Miskaton region; however, there is no<br />
evidence as yet that the &quot;strangling mist&quot; existed in any form prior to the<br />
appearance of Europeans.<br />

<br />
Yet another colorful folk legend involves the recurring image of a &quot;ghost train&quot;<br />
-- a spectral locomotive that materializes from nowhere, glides across the<br />
haunted track for a short period of time, and then disappears as mysteriously as<br />
it came.<br />
<br />
This story did not originate among the first white settlers, of course;<br />
obviously it only came into being after the advent of the steam locomotive in<br />
our burgeoning Machine Age. The earliest known recorded version of this story,<br />
in fact, is dated 1882. Nonetheless, the legend provides us with an interesting<br />
example of how the collective unconscious adapts itself to changing aspects of<br />
our culture, cloaking old symbolism in the trappings of new technology.<br />
<br />
Although many versions hold that the ghost train represents the ghastly echoes<br />
of a locomotive that was wrecked (derailed and lost off a mountain pass is the<br />
most popular means of destruction), this is in fact a simplistic interpretation<br />
not seen until many decades after the myth originated. More intriguing and more<br />
useful to the folklorist are versions that explain the ghost train as a<br />
transport to the land of the dead -- a modernized boat of Charon, ferrying<br />
damned souls across the shroud to the devil's newly industrial Hell. These are<br />
the versions which most faithfully maintain links to the traditions of the past,<br />
and demonstrate the curious evolutionary behavior of the myth.<br />
<br />
In some of these tellings, the traveling soul must have a ticket to present to<br />
the grim conductor -- an element directly analogous to the ancient custom of<br />
placing of gold coins beneath the tongue to buy passage to the underworld.<br />
Living souls who ventured too near the tracks as the ghost train made its<br />
nightly sojourn would find themselves swept along -- echoing the Celtic/Germanic<br />
myth of the Wild Hunt, in which witness were compelled to join as either hunter<br />
or prey. Those who thus boarded the train by accident, madness or mere<br />
foolishness were inevitably carried back to whatever eldritch dimension from<br />
whence the train originated. Tales of return voyages are rare and generally held<br />
by those who pass them along to be apocryphal.<br />

rooftops on either side of the street practically touch each other. To the<br />
south, a side street leads across Whateley Bridge toward the center of town, and<br />
a twisting lane leads up a hill to the northwest. A short flight of steps to the<br />

possibly older than any other structure in the entire city. Ponderously it spans<br />
the dark, torpid waters of the Miskaton River, connecting the north and south<br />
halves of the city and occasionally raining bits of gravel and mortar from its<br />
underside into the water. It looks just wide enough for two cars to pass each<br />
other between the flanking stone parapets, but you wouldn't volunteer to try it.<br />

the mouth of a dark, narrow alley to the southwest. Avenues to the west and east<br />
lead back into the cramped and ingrown streets, while to the north lies Whateley<br />
Bridge.<br />
<br />
In the center of the square, rising from a circular lawn of unhealthy-looking<br />
grass and weeds, stands a strange, stone obelisk. It seems to be a monument of<br />

to speak, and for the first time his voice is steady, without the reedy whine of<br />
alcoholic craving.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ayuh, little Edward had a brother, so he did. And I know him. I know of<br />
William, so I do. I delivered the child. Anna Verlac was his mother. It... it<br />
was... &quot;<br />
<br />
He leans over and grips your arm with a hand that is suddenly steady and strong.<br />
&quot;It was her father's poison seed, y'see. That evil bastard poisoned her womb and<br />
put a monster inside her. What she gave birth to... it was... it wasn't... oh,<br />
God, when I held that... that abortion in the shape of an infant, that thing<br />
with hooves for feet and its crown of writhing... when it looked up at me... It<br />
looked up at me with its father's red-rimmed eyes.&quot; The old man shudders<br />
convulsively, and it is a while before he can speak again.<br />
<br />
&quot;Anna and I decided between ourselves, we did. The... her child... it lived for<br />
a few years, but it was sickly, and in pain, and it could never be normal nor<br />
healthy. She brought it to me... I was her doctor, you see, I'd seen her through<br />
her child's birth, and she trusted me... and I put the thing down, softly and<br />
without pain, and they laid it to rest in the family crypt.<br />
<br />
&quot;And Anna thanked me for it, so she did.&quot;<br />
<br />
The old man falls silent again, and his wavering, bloodshot eyes wander once<br />

The old man grows sickly pale. He raises one hand, as if to ward off the sight<br />
of the skull, deny the truth one more time; then his hand drops, and he sinks<br />
down onto the mattress, groaning.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, it's true,&quot; he cries, &quot;it's true, God help my lying soul. It was her father<br />
who wished to kill the thing, not Anna -- kill it to make way for another, he<br />
said, a 'more fitting vessel'. He wanted to try again -- Gods, the depth of his<br />
evil -- after the way the first one came out, he wanted to try again!<br />
<br />
&quot;Anna came to me and asked for my help, and what could I do? What could I do? It<br />
was her child, for God's sake, no matter what else it was, and she couldn't bear<br />
to lose it. But we had to weigh the coffin down with something...&quot;<br />
<br />
He sits up, suddenly, fastening on you with a sick, pleading look.<br />

&quot;I've told you too much, now,&quot; he whispers desperately. &quot;They'll know; the<br />
maggots'll find out for sure. They'll find me; even in my hole, they'll find<br />
me.&quot; He lets out an eye-wateringly pungent breath, &quot;P'raps it's best they do.<br />
I've spent so long drowning my sins, p'raps time's come to pay for them at last.<br />
This won't do me much good no more,&quot; he says, holding up his little copper key.<br />
&quot;And yet...&quot; He closes his fist around it again. &quot;And yet, maybe there's a<br />
way... they say there's ways to protect yourself, wards versus the Evil Eye and<br />
such. &quot; The old man stares greedily at the amulet around your neck. &quot;Perhaps, if<br />

as he closes his grimy fingers around the charm. &quot;And here y'are,&quot; he says,<br />
tossing you the copper key. &quot;I'll pray it does you good.&quot;<br />
<br />
The old man staggers to his feet. &quot;I'll be gettin' on, then,&quot; he says. &quot;If I can<br />

his fist.<br />

He turns to you one last time. &quot;Don't let them find you,&quot; he says earnestly.<br />
&quot;Get out while you can. If you stay, they'll track you down eventually. It's the<br />
blood. He can smell it, so he can. And he always returns to his blood.&quot;<br />
<br />
He shambles off, up the riverwalk toward Town Square, his shadow dragging long<br />
behind him. Looking to the sky, you realize that the sun is nearly set; you've<br />
been talking to the old man for much longer than you thought, and it will be<br />
dark soon.<br />

I cannot sleep.<br />
<br />
Or perhaps I should say: I must not sleep, since I am perfectly capable of sleep<br />
-- in fact, lately sleep has come to me more easily, more quickly, and more<br />
insidiously than it ever has before. But I don't want to sleep.<br />
<br />
I have been hoping that the terrible dreams would prove to be stress-related,<br />
that they would fade once the move was behind us and we had finally settled in<br />
-- but that has not turned out to be the case. They're stronger than ever. Red-<br />
rimmed eyes pursuing me through strange corridors, and the voice -- the<br />
whisperer who tells me I am not who I am. The whisperer tells me secrets of this<br />
house, secrets of those who lived here -- they are my blood, and he tells me he<br />
always returns to his blood. He tells me of secret keys and combinations; I<br />
don't know what they open yet but I have an idea --<br />
<br />
Tomorrow I must go down to the cellar. I must see if the things revealed to me<br />
in that terrible book are true.<br />

underbrush, into a tangled, moonlit clearing.<br />

sighs. Then he turns and adjusts the coverlet on the child's bed.<br />

He walks over to the vanity and picks up the jewelry box. Carefully, he opens it<br />
and, finding it empty, sets it down again with a soft curse. He looks around the<br />

somewhere. For a moment Michael simply stands there aimlessly, compulsively<br />

The shuttered window at the end of the hall throws a gloomy rectangle of light<br />
onto the bare wooden floor. Doorways lead north and south.<br />

This must be the children's bedroom. The bed is smaller than the one in the<br />
master bedroom, its bright coverlet providing one of the few feeble splashes of<br />
color in what must have been, for most of its history, a joylessly Puritan<br />

under the window stands an ancient crib. The only exit is to the north.<br />

Cellar<br />
The old, flagstone walls gleam with unwholesome-smelling moisture, and the<br />
sagging timbers creak uneasily above your head. Ancient, frayed wiring festoons<br />
the ceiling like some strange species of clinging vine. Portions of the cellar<br />
extend south and east into the clammy darkness, though you could always beat a<br />
hasty retreat up the stairs to the north.<br />

unmortared stone. The entire room is filled with wine racks. They cover every<br />
wall except for one spot to the west, where an exit leads back to the main<br />
cellar.<br />
<br />
All of the racks are dust-covered and empty except for one against the north<br />
wall, which contains some forty or fifty dark bottles.<br />
<br />
You are reminded of something Michael told you during the long drive up: about<br />
how when the police arrived after the shooting, they found the wine cellar in a<br />
shambles -- nearly every bottle thrown to the floor and shattered, and the whole<br />
place reeking of rotted grapes. All except the bottles in the north rack. None<br />
of those had been touched. No one could posit a motive for it.<br />
<br />
You smile a bit, recalling your husband's ability to turn a piece of<br />
insignificant trivia into a compelling story. Still, though, now that you're<br />

with the blasphemous name -- a shrill, grating sound like a dentist's drill. The<br />
air grows thick and terrible shapes waver and melt in the air before you --<br />
shapes that twitch and move with hungry purpose, and seem to look at you -- and<br />
then the ringing fades away. There is a moment of stillness, and then the<br />
gleaming door swings smoothly open on perfectly balanced and utterly silent<br />
hinges.<br />
<br />
<span class="prompt">&gt;</span><span class="promptline" id="line6113">n</span><br />The doorway opens out into a large, dome-ceilinged cavern. You stand at the<br />
threshold for a moment, peering into the strange, phosphorescent gloom, before<br />
your eyes can make out enough details to see what this place is; even then, it<br />
is almost a full minute before your mind can accept what you are seeing...<br />
<br />
Burial Mound<br />
The cave is lined, floor to ceiling, with mummified human corpses. Shrunken and<br />
desiccated, they lie in jumbled heaps inside irregularly carved niches. Carvings<br />
cover the rock walls in between the niches -- grotesque, leering faces too<br />
horrible even to look upon, their features twitching and smirking in the<br />
wavering light that sifts down from above.<br />
<br />
And dominating the center of the chamber: a dark monolith rising up through the<br />
green, murky light -- what you first took to be a large, supporting pillar, you<br />
now realize can only be the true base of the town square obelisk.<br />
<br />
At the narrower, northern end of the vaguely egg-shaped cavern sits a massive<br />
stone altar, flanked on either side by a pair of strange, vibrating columns.<br />

The flute emits an odd mixture of metallic, warbling notes which intertwine and<br />
harmonize eerily with each other.<br />
<br />
The strange harmony of the flute blends with the atonal ringing of the two<br />
columns, and the three sounds suddenly grow stronger, resonating with and<br />
reinforcing one another, intertwining like a dissonant, invisible braid. The<br />
sound increases in volume, piercing your eardrums and causing the very air to<br />
shimmer.<br />
<br />
Suddenly the air above the altar begins to ripple as though with extreme heat.<br />
The very fabric of space seems to twist and buckle between the two columns; and<br />
then, with a sound like a wet sheet being torn slowly down the middle, the<br />
fabric splits.<br />
<br />
You are immediately swept off your feet by a powerful sucking vacuum, pulling<br />
everything within reach toward the portal. Dust and debris; bones and loose rock<br />
from the burial niches; everything not nailed down goes flying across the temple<br />
and into the all-devouring maw hovering over the altar-stone. Desperately, you<br />
wedge your fingers into a crack in the floor and hang on for dear life as the<br />
wind tries to claw you away. You scream, and even the sound of your voice is<br />
whipped away, pulled over your shoulder like a trailing ribbon and sucked into<br />
whatever blasphemous dimension lies beyond that horrible rift.<br />
<br />
For a few agonizing moments you don't think you're going to make it; then,<br />
suddenly, the chaos stops, leaving you breathless on the floor.<br />
<br />
Painstakingly, you pry your stiff, bleeding fingers out of the crack and roll<br />
over. The rift is gone. The air is normal, and the columns are ringing quietly,<br />
as if nothing had happened.<br />

The ceiling descends here to no more than three feet from the floor; you are<br />
forced to crawl through the cramped darkness on your hands and knees. To the<br />

ceiling, and the dust hangs thick and motionless in the air. To the west the<br />

England foliage is famous for its splendid colors in the fall, but the<br />
oppressive weather and pervading murk have leached these trees of most of their<br />
tint. The road continues south into the increasingly dense forest, and in the<br />
other direction heads back to town. A paved walk also leads east through the<br />
trees.<br />

A small group of townsfolk has gathered up at the north end of the road. As you<br />
approach, still breathless from your encounter with the thing at the<br />
slaughterhouse, they turn toward you -- and that's when you notice that the one<br />
in the lead has an axe in his hand. And the one behind him has a pair of garden<br />
shears.<br />

A couple of men move over to your left, and several more step out of the forest<br />
behind you. All of them carry weapons or nasty farm implements of some kind, and<br />
all of them look as though they're just about ready to put an end to a certain<br />

&quot;To whom it may concern --<br />
<br />
&quot;My name is Claudia Benson, and I attest that I am of sound mind and body, at<br />
least for what little time I have left.<br />
<br />
&quot;If you are reading this anywhere within the city limits of Anchorhead, be aware<br />
that your life is in grave and immediate danger. Nearly all of the inhabitants<br />
of this city are members of a secret cult that has thrived since before the<br />
first settlers arrived here in the early 1600s and is still strong today. Its<br />
members are fanatical and quite insane, and will kill anyone who learns their<br />
secrets. I received a phone call early this morning which I believe is a threat<br />
to my life; I assume the cult somehow discovered that I was planning to divulge<br />
information to an outsider and now plans to silence me. In case I don't make it,<br />
I am leaving this testimony for someone to find; hopefully it will be someone<br />
who can put a stop to this madness once and for all.<br />
<br />
&quot;The cult originally evolved from the rituals of the ancient Misquat Indian<br />
tribe that once lived in this region. Although this tribe is now extinct, its<br />
beliefs have been passed down relatively unchanged through generations of<br />
settlers for nearly four centuries. These beliefs center around the worship of<br />
some sort of demon or god from the outer reaches of space, which visited the<br />
earth millions of years ago and will return some day to wreak terrible<br />
destruction. I am unclear on the exact details as there is very little<br />
historical information available on this tribe, unless the University is hiding<br />
material from me, which I am half-convinced it may well be.<br />
<br />
&quot;The ringleaders of this cult are and have always been the Verlac family. Every<br />
second generation a male Verlac is born, and the role of high priest is passed<br />
down from grandfather to grandson, following some arcane ritual of ascension.<br />
There is a persistent legend that this ritual somehow involves a transmigration<br />
of souls -- that, in fact, all male Verlacs are actually the reincarnation of<br />
the original founder of the American line. Although this is obviously nothing<br />
more than local superstition, the legend has such a hold on the people of the<br />
region that it may have become a self-perpetuating delusion on the part of the<br />
members of the Verlac family, each male child honestly believing that he is his<br />
own grandfather reborn. Edward Verlac rejected this obscene birthright, and I<br />
believe that the townspeople drove him to insanity for it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Regardless of the truth behind these legends, the cult is planning to act very<br />
soon. In the 1920s, Edward's grandfather Mordecai Verlac began preaching that<br />
the return of the 'Nameless God' was imminent -- specifically, that it would<br />
occur the day after tomorrow. He re-opened the defunct paper mill, converting it<br />
into a factory to build some sort of device, a 'beacon' with which to facilitate<br />
the Nameless God's entry into this world. This device is very nearly finished,<br />
and in two days they will be ready to enact their great ritual -- what they call<br />
the 'Blessed Event'. It will most likely entail the wholesale slaughter of every<br />
non-cultist man, woman and child in the city. The child abductions of the past<br />
few years were most likely preparatory sacrifices perpetrated by the cult, and<br />
there is no reason to believe that the killing will stop once their great ritual<br />
is complete.<br />
<br />
&quot;If you are, in fact, the young man who planned to move into the Verlac estate,<br />
you must be careful. The cult is almost certainly watching your every move, and<br />
will attempt to induct and brainwash you into their cult or, failing that,<br />
murder both you and your wife. I had hoped to warn you upon your arrival;<br />
however, as the message on my answering machine this morning attests, I don't<br />
have much time left. With any luck, I'll be out of the city by tonight. If I<br />
don't make it, please try to stop these people. This key might help -- I managed<br />
to dig it out our old property file on the lighthouse. I know they consider that<br />
building important for some reason. Do what you can with it. And be careful.<br />
These cultists are a menace, inbred and insane to the last man, and no one will<br />
be safe until they are wiped off the face of the earth.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good luck, and be careful.<br />
<br />

She looks at you suddenly. &quot;Where did you find this? Did you find...&quot; but then<br />

fashioned brass key, a small copper key, an old-fashioned iron key, a key to the<br />
house and a key to the cellar), an old tin (which is closed), a meat hook, a<br />
tattered drawing, a strange metal flute, a puzzle box (which is open but empty),<br />
a towel, a gold locket, a newspaper, a letter opener, an animal's skull, a slip<br />
of paper, Michael's faculty card, a family album, a bundle of soggy pages, a<br />
torn journal and your umbrella.<br />
<br />
Just as the mechanical noises reach a crescendo, the pipes at the north end of<br />
the crawlway suddenly give vent to an enormous gout of superheated steam. The<br />
entire north half of the crawlway is momentarily filled with vapor and intense<br />
heat, which just as quickly dissipates. The noise behind the walls recedes to a<br />
calmer level, and the needle on the gauge swings back down to zero.<br />

the mill. All around you, through the metallic walls, you can hear the<br />
oppressive thumping and grinding of heavy machinery. The air in here is hot and<br />

<br />
A large metal valve wheel juts out from the middle of one of the many fat,<br />

<br />
Strange; although you could hardly call yourself acquainted with the workings of<br />
a paper mill, you can't help but notice that none of the machines you can see<br />
seem to be involved with anything like the making of paper. At any rate, you<br />
don't see any paper -- or any wood pulp, or any dye, or anything else you might<br />
reasonably assume a paper mill would have on hand -- anywhere. The machines are<br />
definitely busy churning out something -- but what?<br />

then, suddenly, the chain pulls taut and jerks you off your feet, hauling you up<br />
through the air -- narrowly missing a piece of heavy equipment sailing past you<br />
on its way down -- all the way up to the catwalk, where the chain slows and<br />
finally stops, depositing you safely, though left somewhat breathless, on the<br />
grilled surface.<br />
<br />
Catwalk<br />
The catwalk stretches north, a narrow ribbon of metal grillwork dangling fifty<br />
feet over the factory floor and shuddering dangerously in time with the machines<br />
beneath it. There are no railings of any kind. At the far end you can see what<br />
looks like a wide balcony with several large banks of equipment.<br />
<br />

your waist.<br />

together to form a sort of open laboratory on this wide balcony overlooking the<br />
mill. A wide table dominates the area, strewn with precision tools, bits of<br />
wire, and scribbled calculations. To the south, a narrow catwalk hangs above the<br />
mill floor, and a metal ladder leads down into the machinery below.<br />
<br />
Prominent among the strange tools scattered across the table is a strange<br />
caliper-like instrument.<br />
<br />
On the workbenches are some notes and some arcane electronic equipment.<br />

One of the racks contains a number of circular mirrors, stacked side by side<br />

!!NOTICE TO ALL BRETHREN!!<br />
The focusing mirrors must be kept absolutely clean at ALL TIMES. Even the<br />
slightest smudge of dirt or grease can create dangerous instabilities in the<br />
refraction patterns.<br />
<br />
All mirrors must receive ionization treatment as a matter of course. As an extra<br />
precaution, however, always use sterilized surgical gloves when handling them.<br />

<span class="prompt">&gt;</span><span class="promptline" id="line1288">x blueprint</span><br />The blueprint is a technical schematic for some extremely complicated device,<br />
the exact purpose of which is anything but clear. It looks a bit like a<br />
telescope, a bit like a microwave oven turned inside out, and a bit like the<br />
&quot;industrial laser&quot; from Goldfinger. The inner workings of the device involve a<br />
complicated arrangement of lenses and mirrors and a hopeless tangle of circuitry<br />
that vaguely resembles several dozen street maps of Manhattan laid across each<br />
other. Some of the notations on the circuitry don't even look like technical<br />
symbols; they look more like cabbalistic runes.<br />
<br />
Next to what must represent the main focusing mirror of the device, someone has<br />

A large metal valve wheel juts out from the middle of one of the many fat,<br />

ground, hidden away behind the imposing shadow of the mill wall. Weeds push up<br />
through cracked and buckling slabs of concrete; twisted rebar and rusting pipes<br />
poke up like the legs of dead insects. The ruins are surrounded on all sides by<br />
dense thickets, although narrow, overgrown trails lead northeast and southeast<br />
through the underbrush.<br />

The road turns southwest here and runs squarely through the front entrance to<br />
the old paper mill. A gate of heavy iron bars blocks the only opening into this<br />
charred fortress, although an overgrown path leads around the wall to the south.<br />
To the north, a rutted lane threads its way past a row of dilapidated shacks.<br />

Mill Road<br />
The road carries you across a desolate heath of gray, windswept grass. To the<br />
south, the black, jagged outline of Anchorhead's steep roofs and sharp, leaning<br />
gables cuts across the horizon. The road forks here to the west and east,<br />
heading across the railroad tracks in one direction, out toward the seashore in<br />
the other.<br />
<br />
A distant flicker of movement draws your eyes to the faraway lighthouse. A lone<br />
figure, tiny in the distance, makes its way stealthily around the small spur of<br />
rock at the end of the breakwater and slips inside the door at the tower's base.<br />
It's impossible to see the person's face from this distance, but the hair, the<br />
way he walks... you'd swear it was Michael.<br />

Breakwater<br />
You are picking your way across the breakwater's bare, rocky spine, where the<br />
road has diminished to little more than a pair of dusty ruts. A hundred yards to<br />
the northeast, at the breakwater's far end, the lonely stone tower of<br />
Anchorhead's lighthouse stands vigil against the ocean.<br />

pillar of pale brick jabbing defiantly up at the sky. The road from the<br />
southwest ends here, although it looks as though you could pick your way down<br />
the rocks to the southeast, around the structure's base.<br />

brass key, a small copper key, an old-fashioned iron key, a key to the house and<br />
a key to the cellar), a lantern (providing light) and a hooded robe.<br />
<br />
The pockets of your trenchcoat contain the mirror labeled #2, an old tin (which<br />

calipers, a book of matches with five matches left, a towel, a hastily written<br />

Top of the Lighthouse<br />
The stairs give onto a wide, circular chamber surrounded by windows. The glass<br />
is old and streaked with grime, but you still have to catch your breath at the<br />
magnificence of the view. In one direction, the dying heath and the stunted<br />
cluster of buildings that is Anchorhead; in the other, the ocean like a vast,<br />
undulating blanket.<br />

Bottom of the Lighthouse<br />
The sound of the ocean is muffled behind the thick cinderblock walls, and the<br />

hoary old whitewashed brick pressing down on you from above. To the west, a<br />
narrow strip of dim light marks the exit. Cracked concrete steps lead up.<br />
<br />
There is a faint scuffing noise from the shadows behind you -- before you can<br />
turn around, something slams into the back of your head with brutal force.<br />
Sparks go off in front of your eyes, and you fall to the cool concrete floor<br />
with the world reeling under you. As you kneel there, dazed and struggling not<br />
to pass out, your assailant walks slowly around you. He pauses, as if wondering<br />
whether or not to finish you off.<br />
<br />
Terror and nausea wash over you in alternating waves. You are too weak to look<br />
up and see his face, but you recognize his shoes easily enough. After all, you<br />
helped him pick them out not three weeks ago.<br />
<br />
More footsteps come down the stairs, and you sense a number of men standing<br />
around you. &quot;We'll take care of her, Your Holiness,&quot; rasps an old, weathered<br />
voice. Rough hands start to drag you to your feet.<br />
<br />
&quot;No,&quot; says Michael, and the hands pause.<br />
<br />
&quot;Your Holiness, she has seen too much,&quot; protests the raspy voice. &quot;She must be<br />
killed.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That won't be necessary,&quot; Michael says. &quot;Put her somewhere out of the way,<br />
where she can't get into any more trouble. I'll deal with her myself... after<br />
the Blessed Event.&quot;<br />
<br />
The horror and pain are too much; the darkness overwhelms you. You try to catch<br />
a glimpse of your husband's face as the men drag you away, but in your clouding<br />
vision all you can see are a pair of burning, red-rimmed eyes...<br />

The most merciful thing in the world, I<br />
think, is the inability of the human<br />
mind to correlate all its contents. We<br />
live on a placid island of ignorance in<br />
the midst of black seas of infinity,<br />
and it was not meant that we should<br />
voyage far... but some day the piecing<br />
together of dissociated knowledge will<br />
open up such terrifying vistas of<br />
reality, and of our frightful position<br />
therein, that we shall either go mad<br />
from the revelation or flee from the<br />
deadly light into the peace and safety<br />
of a new dark age.<br />

Numb.<br />
<br />
You float slowly to consciousness like a bubble rising to the surface of some<br />
warm, thick oil. You are numb.<br />
<br />
For several minutes, that is as much as your battered mind can handle, that one<br />
thought: you are numb.<br />
<br />
Then your head becomes a bit clearer, and you connect the thought with the<br />
sensations trying to make their way through your foggy brain. You are numb. Your<br />
arms. You can't feel your arms at all.<br />
<br />
You try to get up but you can't move; you merely flop over onto your stomach<br />
like a struggling worm. You roll back over and sit up, and at last your vision<br />
clears and you finally get a good look around, and the horror of your situation<br />
finally slams home...<br />
<br />
Padded Cell<br />
You are in a padded cell, the kind typically reserved for raving lunatics. The<br />
room is barely eight feet by eight feet square, with walls and floor of concrete<br />
covered with thick, quilted padding. The door in the west wall is also covered<br />
with padding, except for a tiny observation window about five feet up, from<br />

&quot;My name is Edward Verlac, and this is my testament:<br />
<br />
&quot;I am utterly, utterly mad.<br />
<br />
&quot;They have locked me in here for my own safety -- and for the safety of others.<br />
My arms are bound in a strait jacket. Yet this is no less than I deserve. I am<br />
writing this using a needle dropped carelessly by one of the orderlies some<br />
weeks ago; biting my lip to draw blood for the ink, I hold the tiny steel quill<br />
beneath my teeth to write. This exhaustive task shall be my last on earth; when<br />
I am finished, I shall dash my brains out against the cell window. The last of<br />
the Verlacs will be dead, and the world made a slightly brighter place thereby.<br />
<br />
&quot;Know this: I did not slip into madness through any weakness or congenital<br />
defect (except insofar as my blood is indelibly tainted with the cursed ichor of<br />
the Verlac line) -- I was driven mad by the spectre of my great-great ancestor,<br />
Croseus Verlac. For generations that fiend has traveled down the family line,<br />
passing from body to body in a hideous, incestuous ritual whereby he impregnates<br />
his own daughter, then projects his black soul into the innocent body of his<br />
infant grandson. I myself was horrified to discover that I am in fact the<br />
progeny of my own grandfather, Mordecai Verlac, and his wretched, tormented<br />
daughter -- my mother, Anna. The experiment failed on the first attempt,<br />
producing William, my sickly, malformed elder brother whom I never knew.<br />
William, however, died while still a toddler -- or so my mother has always told<br />
me -- and the next unholy coupling resulted in me.<br />
<br />
&quot;From as early as I can remember, I could feel the lurking presence of my<br />
grandfather, who died the day I was born, and who I now realize was little more<br />
than a fleshly disguise for the pernicious warlock Croseus. He stalked the<br />
boundaries of my mind, seeking a means of entrance, of condemning my soul to<br />
limbo and taking up a fresh, new abode in my young limbs. His evil, red-rimmed<br />
eyes haunted my every dream and o'ershadowed even my waking hours. The amulet my<br />
mother gave me while I was still in the crib protected me -- for the old man<br />
cannot abide its presence, and must flee all who wear it -- but Mother died<br />
while I was still young, and since then my folly has brought tragedy to myself<br />
and to all those I love.<br />
<br />
&quot;The memory of my mother's urgent warnings faded soon after her death. I became<br />
embarrassed by the scandal that seemed to hover over my family name like a pall,<br />
and was mortified by the superstitious trinket that I still wore around my neck,<br />
as if in ignorant servitude to those old myths. The red-rimmed eyes had not<br />
given me nightmares since my twelfth birthday, and I dismissed them as an<br />
immature fancy that had passed along with my boyhood. At the age of 21, I pawned<br />
the amulet at a magic shop somewhere in town, and thereby sealed my doom.<br />
<br />
&quot;For ten years I have resisted Croseus' demonic encroachment upon my mind, my<br />
soul, my very being, with only the strength of my will. It was not enough. I<br />
found my mind flooded at the oddest times with strange, antiquarian memories; my<br />
speech and mannerisms lapsed into uncharacteristic, archaic patterns; and worst<br />
of all, I found myself looking at my dear daughter Gertrude -- only seven years<br />
old! -- in the most unwholesome way, with the most unmentionable ideas creeping<br />
through my subconscious.<br />
<br />
&quot;I scoured every street in this cursed town, looking for that magic shop, but I<br />
have never found it. In desperation I began delving into old histories and<br />
forbidden genealogies, researching the history of the dread Verlac name for some<br />
solution to my plight. I discovered no answers, only the horrors I have just<br />
written of. But I also discovered something worse -- the ultimate purpose behind<br />
the old demon's nefarious bodysnatching!<br />
<br />
&quot;He plans to unleash a primordial evil such that the earth could not possibly<br />
survive. I have seen the plans and the blueprints; I have read the dread tome in<br />
my great-great grandfather's church; I have used the obsidian lens that is not<br />
true obsidian, and I have looked upon what that madman means to draw down onto<br />
this earth! He and this town, his foul congregation of fanatics and madmen! They<br />
are all a part of it! They have been watching me, waiting for me to change,<br />
waiting for the return of their monstrous high priest!!<br />
<br />
&quot;It was then that I realized that killing only myself would not be enough; for<br />
the degenerate inhabitants of this town would hunt down my family and wreak a<br />
terrible vengeance if I took from them their Messiah. And besides; who could say<br />
whether the crafty devil Croseus might not concoct some new way to enter the<br />
world, through a new body -- through that of one of my daughters, perhaps? The<br />
ritual has always demanded a grandson, but Croseus was never one to let such a<br />
trivial inconvenience stop him. He would find a way. He always returns to his<br />
blood.<br />
<br />
&quot;I did the only thing I could do -- Julia, I am so terribly sorry, but I will be<br />
with you soon -- I could not let him have you, or Gertrude or Sonia -- and I<br />
will not let him have me. Say good-bye to the last of the Verlacs -- there will<br />
be no blood for him once I am gone.&quot;<br />

Asylum Courtyard<br />
The grim, white-washed edifice of Danvers Asylum bounds this tiny, shadowed<br />
courtyard to the south, its narrow, barred windows staring blankly down at you<br />
like ranks of shriveled, empty eye sockets. You can escape through a narrow<br />
gateway in the high, brick wall to the north.<br />
<br />
The madman comes prancing out the front door of the asylum, and suddenly stops<br />
dead in his tracks. He looks around, utterly dumbfounded. He looks up at the<br />
sky, and feels the raindrops striking his face. Slowly it dawns on his addled<br />
brain that he is outside; that he is, in fact, free.<br />
<br />
With a wild whoop of pure joy, the madman hobbles away down the street, laughing<br />
and chattering to himself with such unabashed happiness that for a moment you<br />
almost forget that you have just let loose a dangerous and quite probably<br />
homicidal psychotic into the world at large.<br />

by the leaning, steep-roofed architecture that looms over everything in this<br />
city. The municipal courthouse stands at the south end of the square, next to<br />
the mouth of a dark, narrow alley to the southwest. Avenues to the west and east<br />
lead back into the cramped and ingrown streets, while to the north lies Whateley<br />
Bridge.<br />
<br />
In the center of the square, rising from a circular lawn of unhealthy-looking<br />
grass and weeds, stands a strange, stone obelisk. It seems to be a monument of<br />
some sort, although you can see no plaque or marker anywhere near it.<br />
<br />
As you step into the open square you hear a sudden commotion -- several crowds<br />
of people are converging onto the town square from different directions. You can<br />
hear their shouts and see the flickering glow of their torches as the mob begins<br />
to swarm in from the north and east.<br />

Robed men brandishing torches pour into the square, rallying around the obelisk<br />
at its center. Several of them seem to be struggling with someone. You huddle<br />
back into the shadows, but&nbsp;&nbsp;no one seems to notice yet another robed figure in<br />

The struggling men step forward, and you can see they have the old bum from the<br />
vacant lot. His wrists are bound and his arms held by two cultists on either<br />
side. Although he screams and writhes with frantic desperation, the frail old<br />
drunkard is no match for his captors. Someone raises his hands for silence --<br />
you can't quite see him from where you are -- and the mob quiets down. Even the<br />
old bum's screams lower to a fearful whimpering.<br />

Overhead, the swollen clouds flicker ominously with a greenish haze of sheet<br />
lightning.<br />

the old bum -- &quot;has divulged our secrets to an outsider and betrayed the sacred<br />
trust of our brotherhood! For this, his soul must be condemned forever, embraced<br />
and encysted within the necrotic folds of the Womb of Nehilim!&quot;<br />

The old man stops short. The flickering torchlight illuminates your face, and<br />
his eyes widen in recognition. He opens his mouth to speak...<br />
<br />
And four burly cultists tackle him simultaneously, pulling him down. As the old<br />
man's body hits the ground, a small, shiny object falls out of the bum's clothes<br />
and bounces out across the cobblestones, unnoticed by all.<br />

possibly older than any other structure in the entire city. Ponderously it spans<br />
the dark, torpid waters of the Miskaton River, connecting the north and south<br />
halves of the city and occasionally raining bits of gravel and mortar from its<br />
underside into the water. It looks just wide enough for two cars to pass each<br />
other between the flanking stone parapets, but you wouldn't volunteer to try it.<br />
<br />
As you approach the bridge, you see a hulking shadow lurking about on the far<br />
bank. You slow down warily, remembering the townsfolk who threatened you<br />
earlier, peering through the darkness and obscuring rain to catch a glimpse of<br />
the person. Then the figure moves slightly, and you realize that it's much<br />
larger than a man; in fact, the figure isn't shaped anything like a man at all.<br />
<br />
A sudden crack of lightning illuminates the bridge for a brief, horrible instant<br />
-- and in that instant, you see it.<br />
<br />
In the next few moments, your battered mind manages to blot out the memory of<br />
that bloated, barrel-like, armless trunk; those thick, double-jointed legs that<br />
end in shiny black hooves; that writhing forest of fleshy tendrils crowning the<br />
torso in place of a proper head -- but you are not, and will never be, able to<br />
banish the horrible, searing memory of the thing's misplaced face which leers<br />
madly out at you from the side of the trunk -- that child's face on a monster's<br />

A sizzling bolt of lightning cuts through the night sky, illuminating your<br />
surroundings in a sudden sheet of blinding white radiance that leaves eerie,<br />
green afterimages scarred onto your retinas.<br />

face.<br />
<br />
For a single heartbeat of time, even the storm seems to hold still. The little<br />
boy's face gazes at the picture in the locket for a long, aching moment. And a<br />
silent tear wells up in the corner of its eye and trickles down its cheek.<br />

thrashes about helplessly, knocking you onto the ground, and you scramble back<br />
on your hands and feet crab-style, trying to get away from its struggles.<br />
<br />
Another flash of lightning, and you see the thing stagger over to the side of<br />
the bridge. One tentacle manages to pluck out the hook, which clatters to the<br />
pavement -- but the damage has been done. The monster hits the stone parapet,<br />
overbalances, and goes over the side, taking the locket with it. It hits the<br />
water with a giant splash and is instantly engulfed by the raging current. By<br />
the time you get to your feet, rush to the side and look over, the monster's<br />
body is gone.<br />

the sky. Its exact purpose is unfathomable, but it is emitting an ominous,<br />
throbbing hum and radiating a curious warmth that causes an unwholesome<br />

<br />
Most of the exposed components are too complex to comprehend, but there is a<br />
receptacle about two thirds of the way along the thing's -- er, &quot;barrel&quot; -- that<br />
contains a round mirror, like a focusing mirror in a telescope. It looks as<br />

Michael pauses, glances down at the mirror in his hand, then smirks at you. &quot;But<br />
of course, there's no telling where else you've been poking around, what you<br />
might have gotten your dirty little hands on, hmm?&quot;<br />
<br />
He leans in close to you, and you can smell corruption on his breath like<br />
rotting oranges. &quot;I've been wondering where this had gotten off to,&quot; he murmurs<br />
in your ear, taking the caliper-like instrument from you. He applies the<br />
instrument to the mirror, and frowns as he checks the readout.<br />
<br />
Then he smiles.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, that's that then,&quot; he says, placing the mirror back in its receptacle. He<br />
nods toward the guards, who seize you and begin dragging you down the stairs.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's time to clue you in to just what's been going on around here,&quot; Michael<br />
says, following behind you. &quot;First hand. I think you'll find it quite...<br />
enthralling.&quot;<br />
<br />
You are dragged bodily down to the foot of the lighthouse and around to the<br />
rocky outcropping, where an island of flesh floats just beyond the breakwater's<br />
tip. The guards shove their way through the crowds of robed supplicants,<br />
carrying you to the island's center. They force you to your knees and, despite<br />
your best efforts at escape, manhandle you into a pair of handcuffs looped<br />
through an iron ring set in a heavy stone block. The block is so low, you are<br />
forced to remain kneeling in the squelchy muck, craning your neck to watch the<br />
orgiastic ceremoney taking place... and your husband -- no, you tell yourself,<br />
not your husband; the creature that your husband has become -- leading the<br />
terrible rites.<br />
<br />
Island of Flesh<br />
The island is barely forty feet across, its surface covered with an ankle-deep<br />
layer of slime and muck. Underneath the muck, the ground throbs -- heaving<br />
rhythmically to a blasphemous, living pulse.<br />
<br />
The sea thrashes against the shore with storm-driven fury.<br />
<br />
The robed guards hover to either side of you, waiting for you to make a move.<br />
<br />
Michael stands in the center of it all, leading the hellish rites.<br />
<br />
Robed cultists crowd around on every side -- some of them brandishing flaming<br />
torches, some of them chanting in some hideous, archaic tongue, all of them<br />
swaying to the hypnotic pulse that rises up from the depths of the fleshy<br />
ground.<br />
<br />
You are handcuffed to one of several heavy stone blocks set in a rough<br />
semicircle around the center of the island.<br />
<br />
Lashed to a stake in the center of the island is a young boy.<br />

<br />
&quot;Iach! That Which May Not Be Named, I call upon Thee! Formless Drifter of the<br />

The flames seem to hang for a moment in strange patterns before twisting away<br />
into nothing.<br />
<br />
&quot;OHODOS - SCIES - ABYSSON!&quot;<br />
<br />
The torch flares up with a roar, and the ocean waves seem to respond with<br />
sudden, inexplicable fury, crashing brutally against the island.<br />

The boy cries pitifully, his sobs going unheeded by the chanting cultists and<br />

A monstrous bolt of lightning licks down from the sky and strikes the sea just<br />
north of the island, sending a spume of steam and boiling water fifty feet into<br />

over the Heretics of Kron, and force their vile copulations upon the repentant,<br />

Another lightning bolt, this time striking just south of the island, and another<br />

Michael makes a three-quarter turn to his left, coming all the way around to<br />
face the lighthouse once more.<br />
<br />
&quot;To the Ultimate West, wherein lies the Void That Conquers All, I summon Thee!&quot;<br />
<br />
The top of the lighthouse begins to glow with an unwholesome, violet light. A<br />
low, ominous vibration creeps up from the ground, crawling up through your bones<br />
and reverberating painfully in your teeth.<br />

For all this, however, you instantly recognize his face from the newspaper<br />
story: it's Jeffrey Greer, the boy who was kidnapped two days ago.<br />
<br />
The air around the lighthouse is rippling now. Several cultists fall convulsing<br />
to the mud; others are screaming in strange, strangled tongues. The earth<br />
shakes, and the air is split by a high-pitched harmonic ringing, like a crystal<br />
about to shatter.<br />

Michael raises the torch, preparing to thrust it into the pyre at the child's<br />

licked by the purple radiance, not yet cognizant that the ritual has gone wrong.<br />

&quot;The mirror...&quot; he whispers hoarsely.<br />

Bits of burning debris are raining down on the island. The cultists fall back in<br />
panic and start pushing at each other to get off the island and escape. Many are<br />
pushed off into the water, where clusters of ropy, jellyfish-like tentacles<br />
immediately drag them screaming beneath the waves. A burning chunk of masonry<br />
strikes one of your guards in the head, and he drops to the mud next to you with<br />
a mass of chewed-spaghetti pulp where his face used to be. The other guard takes<br />
a quick, frightened look around, then bolts without a backward glance.<br />
<br />
&quot;Come back!&quot; screams Michael. &quot;Come back, cowards!&quot; But no one heeds him. With a<br />

Anchorhead's lighthouse stands vigil against the ocean.<br />

Entrance to the Paper Mill<br />
The road turns southwest here and runs squarely through the front entrance to<br />
the old paper mill. A gate of heavy iron bars blocks the only opening into this<br />
charred fortress, although an overgrown path leads around the wall to the south.<br />
To the north, a rutted lane threads its way past a row of dilapidated shacks.<br />

decrepit, clapboard shacks. The town is quiet, almost deserted; only a few bits<br />
of loose tarpaper blowing listlessly in the wind betray the overall stillness.<br />
<br />
The young boy you freed from the island is standing here. He gives you a fearful<br />
glance.<br />
<br />
Flakes of ash drift gently down from the sky like gray snow, coating everything<br />
with a thin layer of soot, which is quickly washed away by the rain.<br />

Silently, the boy walks through the churning mud to the front steps of #11 Mill<br />
Town Road. For a moment, he stands there on the stoop, looking back at you;<br />
dirty, disheveled, drenched by the streaming rain. Then he turns and, raising<br />
his little fist, knocks on the door.<br />
<br />
The door opens. The old woman looks out, then looks down. She sees the boy, and<br />
it seems that she becomes just a little bit younger at that moment. &quot;My baby...&quot;<br />
you hear her say, and then she is on her knees, folding her son into her arms.<br />
She stands, still holding him, and looks over his shoulder at you.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you,&quot; she says. Her eyes speak volumes of gratitude that her words will<br />
never be able to express. &quot;Thank you for bringing him home.&quot;<br />
<br />
And then she goes inside, and the door slowly closes behind her.<br />

the dark, torpid waters of the Miskaton River, connecting the north and south<br />
halves of the city and occasionally raining bits of gravel and mortar from its<br />

city. The municipal courthouse stands at the south end of the square, next to<br />
the mouth of a dark, narrow alley to the southwest. Avenues to the west and east<br />
lead back into the cramped and ingrown streets, while to the north lies Whateley<br />

Michael -- or rather, the thing that has possessed Michael's body -- is standing<br />
here.<br />
<br />
The poor old man's mutilated corpse hangs from the top of the obelisk.<br />
<br />
Michael looks at you and smiles. It is not a particularly pleasant smile. He<br />
walks over to the obelisk and places his hand against the bloodstained stone,<br />
then mutters something guttural under his breath. The twisted hieroglyphs begin<br />
to shine with an eerie phosphorescence which quickly brightens and envelopes<br />
Michael. His form wavers, then becomes transparent, and when the light fades he<br />
has disappeared.<br />
<br />
The obelisk is still glowing.<br />

and when your eyes clear, you are somewhere else...<br />
<br />
Burial Mound<br />
The cave is lined, floor to ceiling, with mummified human corpses. Shrunken and<br />
desiccated, they lie in jumbled heaps inside irregularly carved niches. Carvings<br />
cover the rock walls in between the niches -- grotesque, leering faces too<br />
horrible even to look upon, their features twitching and smirking in the<br />
wavering light that sifts down from above.<br />
<br />
Michael -- or rather, the thing that has possessed Michael's body -- is standing<br />
here.<br />
<br />
The obelisk base stands before you, vast and shadowy in the green, murky light.<br />
<br />
At the narrower, northern end of the vaguely egg-shaped cavern sits a massive<br />
stone altar, flanked on either side by a pair of strange, vibrating columns.<br />
<br />
Suddenly Michael lunges forward and grabs your arms. He shakes you, causing your<br />
head to whip back and forth and your teeth to click painfully together.<br />
<br />
&quot;Bitch -- &quot; he hisses, &quot; -- rotten, filthy bitch -- you never give up, do you?<br />
You've foiled me for the last time! There's no way to fix what you've undone<br />
tonight, but by all the unholy spawn of darkness I will put you in a stone cold<br />
place for it!!&quot; And his hands lock tightly around your throat and begin to<br />
squeeze.<br />

humanity still survives within that shell; if the person who was your husband<br />
still exists somewhere, buried beneath the part that is Croseus Verlac...<br />
<br />
Silently, you raise up your left hand, your wedding ring gleaming softly in the<br />
strange, green light.<br />
<br />
Michael is transfixed. He seems to want to recoil from the sight, yet is somehow<br />
simultaneously drawn to it. Suddenly, his face crumbles, the madness and stoic<br />
evil falling away to reveal confusion, fear, vulnerability and anguish -- all<br />
superimposed upon the malevolent features of Croseus, struggling to regain<br />
control.<br />

grip, you slip the amulet's cord around Michael's neck, letting the silver<br />
pendant drop to his chest.<br />
<br />
Instantly Michael begins convulsing, arching his back and clawing at his chest.<br />
His jaws stretch open as if to release a howl of torment, but instead of voice,<br />
a thick, ropy stream of ectoplasmic mist pours from his throat. It pools into<br />
the center of the room, roils about, then coalesces into a human form -- the<br />
vaporous, half-rotted apparition of Croseus Verlac himself!<br />

<span class="prompt">&gt;</span><span class="promptline" id="line3199">cover hole 1</span><br />You place your finger over the first flute hole.<br />
<br />
The ghost lets out a chilling, sepulchral laugh. &quot;You useless, puny mortal,&quot; it<br />

I have lived and thrived for over four hundred years -- not even Death can claim<br />

disciples, one by one, and kill them all? Will you set this whole town to the<br />
torch?&quot;<br />

Michael is doubled over with racking coughs, bringing up a thin trickle of<br />
blood.<br />
<br />
<span class="prompt">&gt;</span><span class="promptline" id="line3218">play flute</span><br />(the strange metal flute)<br />
The flute emits an odd mixture of metallic, warbling notes which intertwine and<br />
harmonize eerily with each other.<br />
<br />
The strange harmony of the flute blends with the atonal ringing of the two<br />
columns, and the three sounds suddenly grow stronger, resonating with and<br />
reinforcing one another, intertwining like a dissonant, invisible braid. The<br />
sound increases in volume, piercing your eardrums and causing the very air to<br />
shimmer.<br />
<br />
Suddenly the air above the altar begins to ripple as though with extreme heat.<br />
The very fabric of space seems to twist and buckle between the two columns; and<br />
then, with a sound like a wet sheet being torn slowly down the middle, the<br />
fabric splits.<br />
<br />
You are immediately swept off your feet by a powerful sucking vacuum, pulling<br />
everything within reach toward the portal. Dust and debris; bones and loose rock<br />
from the burial niches; everything not nailed down goes flying across the temple<br />
and into the all-devouring maw hovering over the altar-stone. Desperately, you<br />
wedge your fingers into a crack in the floor; with the other hand you grasp hold<br />
of Michael's pants leg and hang on for dear life.<br />
<br />
Verlac is caught like a gossamer thread in a tornado. Frantically he claws at<br />
the air, but as an insubstantial ghost there is nothing for him to hang on to.<br />
Shrieking and cursing, he is dragged inexorably back, closer and closer to the<br />
portal, until the suction draws his corpus out into a long, trailing ribbon,<br />
like an unraveling cable-knit sweater -- and in the next moment he is gone<br />
forever, sucked into whatever alien dimension lies beyond that horrible rift.<br />
<br />
For a few agonizing moments you don't think you're going to make it; then,<br />
suddenly, the chaos stops, leaving you breathless on the floor.<br />
<br />
Painstakingly, you pry your stiff, bleeding fingers out of the crack and roll<br />
over. The rift is gone. The air is normal, and the columns are ringing quietly,<br />
as if nothing had happened.<br />
<br />
Silence reigns.<br />
<br />
There passes some time that your memory cannot account for; a brief period of<br />
blackness and oblivion, you and your unconscious husband, together in the<br />
subterranean vault. Perhaps you were unconscious as well; you cannot remember.<br />
At some point you become conscious again. You lift Michael to his feet, putting<br />
his arm around your shoulders, and the two of you stagger up the titan stairs to<br />
the surface. The ground begins rumbling just as you are exiting the house, but<br />
by that time Michael has recovered some of his senses and can walk a bit faster.<br />
<br />
You make it down to the bend in the road overlooking the town just in time to<br />
see the town square collapse, the vile obelisk sinking into the earth. Several<br />
buildings are dragged down along with it. A gas pipe ruptures in the courthouse,<br />
sending a gout of flame high into the air, and soon the entire town is burning.<br />
<br />
Behind you, a muffled explosion and a sudden warmth against your back bespeak a<br />
similar end to the Verlac family mansion. For a moment you find yourself almost<br />
turning back, driven by instinct to rescue your belongings -- but you stop. You<br />
turn away. And while Michael rests, you stand at the overlook and watch the<br />
sparks rise like fireflies, mingling with the stars in a clear, cloudless sky.<br />
<br />

Of course, you have already surmised that there are many creative ways in which<br />
you can die in this game. Whether or not you find that particularly amusing...<br />
well, that's between you and your conscience. I, for one, found them amusing to<br />
code; perhaps you will find them amusing to experience.<br />
<br />
Do not attempt the following at home:<br />
<br />
- standing on the train tracks until the train comes.<br />
- standing on the altar while you blow the flute.<br />
- wandering around the Narrow Aisles adjacent to the Mill Floor for too long.<br />
<br />
- not giving Michael the mirror when he asks for it.<br />
- letting Michael die before you destroy Croseus.<br />
- reading the big black book in the abandoned church -- in its entirety.<br />
- EXAMINING William Verlac.<br />
- ATTACKING Michael with the meat hook.<br />
- allowing the summoning ritual to proceed to its conclusion without<br />
sabotaging the beacon first.<br />

Did you try just typing LISTEN while Michael is in the shower on the morning of<br />
Day 2? Type it several times.<br />
<br />
Did you take a good look at the paintings in the gallery? One scene in<br />
particular will catch your eye. EXAMINE the scene. Leave the room and come back<br />
later, and EXAMINE the paintings again.<br />
<br />
In Claudia Benson's last letter, she mentions that she did some research at the<br />
Miskatonic library. Did you try looking her name up on the circulation register?<br />
You might find some interesting reading material.<br />
<br />
You may have noticed that your appearance changes as the game progresses and you<br />
get more and more filthy. Did you try EXAMINING yourself while wearing the<br />
strait jacket? How about talking to yourself?<br />
<br />
Also, did you EXAMINE yourself during the epilogue?<br />
<br />
Did you try SCREAMING or CRYING? Did you try it while handcuffed to the island<br />
at the end of Chapter Four?<br />
<br />
If you wait around for a while at the Twisting Lane or the Rocky Spur, you might<br />
catch something interesting. You might have to wait a long time, though.<br />

Did you try typing XYZZY? No? Good.<br />

Several puzzles in Anchorhead admit more than one solution; some even boast more<br />
than two. Many of these alternate solutions are actually &quot;second chances&quot; that<br />
pop up elsewhere in the story, should you happen to miss the narrow window of<br />
oppourtunity provided to solve the puzzle the first time. Although my caveat<br />
about saving in &quot;About This Game&quot; still holds, there are actually few mistakes<br />
in Anchorhead that are truly irreversible (other than the immediately fatal<br />
ones, of course).<br />
<br />
You might find it interesting to go back and see if you can find other ways to:<br />
<br />
- discover the name &quot;Verlac&quot;.<br />
- clear away the spiderweb in the cellar.<br />
- get the brass key from the attic cell.<br />
- obtain Michael's faculty card.<br />
- open the puzzle box.<br />
- reach the bottom riser from the church basement.<br />
- spy on Michael on the morning of the third day.<br />
- turn the steam-release wheel.<br />
- get up to the mill catwalk.<br />
- open the real estate agent's desk drawer.<br />
- safely witness the old bum's murder.<br />
- get rid of the madman in Danvers Asylum.<br />

&quot;Obscure fact: Edward writes that he pricked the inside of his cheek to draw<br />
blood for his ink. The inside of the cheek isn't a good choice for an inkwell,<br />
since it's mighty difficult to get it to bleed. Have you bitten your cheek while<br />
chewing food? It hurts, but it doesn't bleed. Have you seen body manipulators<br />
pierce their cheeks with a metal skewer? They choose the cheek precisely because<br />
it won't bleed. You can try this at home yourself with a needle or a large<br />
safety pin. Sterilize it, psyche yourself up, and pierce the cheek from the<br />
inside to the outside. It's *very* disconcerting, but it's not painful, and if<br />
there's any blood at all, it will bleed from the *outside* of the cheek, not the<br />
inside.&quot;<br />

&quot;This is horrible, but I got really confused at the epilogue, because I thought<br />
I hadn't taken the pregnancy test yet. (It's amazing how difficult it is to<br />
express taking a pregnancy test in IF commands.)&quot;<br />

stacks -- all the more esoteric and mysterious volumes from the university's<br />
collection. If anything, the area behind the counter is even more shadowy than<br />
the side you're on. The main reading area lies south.<br />
<br />
Hanging on the wall next to the counter is a small, printed sign. Beneath the<br />
sign sits a heavy, dog-eared register, and sitting next to the register is a<br />
bell.<br />

in the Colonial Period by Warner Greene. It's a slim volume, published by<br />
Miskaton Press in 1943. According to the introduction, the book's purpose is to<br />
give an objective account of the social and economic factors which led some of<br />
the early American colonies into violent conflict with the tribes of the<br />
northeast, concluding with a transitional discussion of how the &quot;Indian<br />
policies&quot; which took shape early on evolved into Western Expansionism and the<br />
idea of Manifest Destiny. The author, reflecting the more conservative decade in<br />
which he wrote, tends to paint a more sympathetic picture of the European side<br />
of the issue than would be fashionable today; but all in all it seems an<br />
intelligent, thoughtful analysis.<br />
<br />
Glancing through the table of contents, you notice that there is a short chapter<br />
on the Misquat Indians. Curious, you flip to the page.<br />
<br />
The fate of the Misquat tribe, states the author, is an enigma which may never<br />
be solved. Diplomatic relationships with the original river valley settlers<br />
seemed doomed from the beginning. Documents from the period paint the tribe as<br />
aggressively pagan, degenerate savages. Nevertheless, Croseus Verlac managed to<br />
hammer out a peace treaty of sorts with the tribal leader, and the two groups<br />
led an uneasy coexistence for over a century.<br />
<br />
The exact circumstances which led up to the &quot;battle&quot; of Quattac Bend in 1772 are<br />
unclear. One document makes mention of an &quot;uprising&quot;, although since as far as<br />
is known, the Misquats were never in a subservient relationship to the<br />
Anchorhead settlers, the use of this term is more puzzling than revealing. In<br />
fact, no evidence has yet been discovered that corroborates the notion that the<br />
Misquat Indians initiated any sort of hostility whatsoever.<br />
<br />
What is known is this: the Battle of Quattac Bend took place in the dead of<br />
night. It was led by Croseus' descendant, Heinrich Verlac, and &quot;fought&quot; by some<br />
twenty town men, who crept through the woods and ambushed the small tribe during<br />
one of its holy ceremonies. There are no lists of casualties. Although the diary<br />
of one soldier tells of many prisoners being taken, there is no mention of where<br />
these prisoners were kept or what was eventually done to them.<br />
<br />
No known document makes even the vaguest allusion to the Misquat Indians after<br />
1772. From that date onward, the tribe effectively ceases to exist.<br />

<br />
<span class="prompt">&gt;</span><span class="promptline" id="line3675">read horne</span><br />According to the author's foreword, the term &quot;metempsychosis&quot; means the<br />
transmigration of souls -- that is, the reincarnation of a soul into another<br />
body. The book, which was published in 1922, is an examination of various<br />
traditions' explanations of how and why this happens. The author's tone is very<br />
matter-of-fact; it's unclear whether he is approaching the subject from the<br />
standpoint of a mythologist or if he actually believes in reincarnation and is<br />
evaluating the various theories based on their &quot;scientific&quot; validity.<br />
<br />
Flipping through the book, you find a passage that has been highlighted:<br />
<br />
&quot;Among tribes with a strong ancestor-worship tradition, one often discovers the<br />
quaint notion that one may be reincarnated as one's own descendant. Asking such<br />
people whether they must share a single body with the spirit of their ancestor<br />
(inheritance), or if they themselves are in essence their own grandfather<br />
(identity), is generally futile; among primitives, concepts of self-identity are<br />
poorly defined at best. Often there exists no word in their native language to<br />
express the idea. One can assume, however, that the primitive tribesman's<br />
conception of the situation is probably closer to the latter option; otherwise,<br />
over the course of generations one would have to contend with dozens of<br />
ancestral spirits fighting for room within a single body. However, the theory of<br />
identity also begs the question: how far back does the chain of reincarnation<br />
go? One could conceivably be dealing with a tribe of 'first' men, present at the<br />
day of Creation and renewing themselves over the aeons with each succeeding<br />
generation.&quot;<br />

some interest that it was published in 1918 by Miskaton University Press, though<br />
who &quot;Lord Wheldrake&quot; was you cannot begin to fathom.<br />
<br />
Even without a background in physics, you can immediately tell that this is<br />
nothing but the purest pseudoscience. The author claims to have made &quot;startling<br />
advances&quot; relating to a heretofore unknown medium through which energy can<br />
travel. As far as you can tell, he performed no actual experiments; his entire<br />
thesis is built on extrapolation from his own creative reasoning. One bit near<br />
the middle has been marked with a highlighter:<br />
<br />
&quot;Having established the existence of the N-space medium, we can then reasonably<br />
posit the existence of a special wave-length capable of traveling through that<br />
medium; we will call this form of energy, appropriately enough, N-rays. Due to<br />
the fundamentally extradimensional nature of N-space, N-rays cannot logically be<br />
located at any one point of the electromagentic spectrum; they instead exist at<br />
every point along the spectrum, traveling perpendicular it. Naturally, the<br />
practical ramifications of being able to transmit extradimensionally are dwarfed<br />
by the theoretical implications...&quot;<br />
<br />
Good grief, you can't help thinking. What drivel.<br />
