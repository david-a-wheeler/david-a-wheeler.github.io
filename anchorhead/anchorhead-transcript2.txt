Empty Stairwell
This alcove used to house a stairwell leading up and down; now it contains only
a few rotted boards jutting from the walls and an empty shaft dropping down out
of sight. Above you hang the broken-off remains of the stairs leading up to the
ground floor, the last shattered riser only a couple of tantalizing feet out of
reach.

You switch the flashlight off.

You take a few steps back, draw in a deep breath, and make a dash for the edge.
At the last possible second you jump, sailing out over the pit as you make a
desperate grab for the bottom riser...

... and catch it.

Unfortunately, you lose your grip on the trenchcoat while trying to grab the
riser, and it tumbles into the darkness below.

The riser bends ominously under your weight but doesn't give. Panting, you haul
yourself up onto the creaking stairs.

Church Cellar
Centipedes and beetles scurry away across the rotten floorboards as you shine
your light across the room. Over in the corner sits a hulking shape of black
metal that was probably once a wood-burning furnace; aside from that, the cellar
looks empty. A dark alcove, the shadows within too thick to see through, opens
in the west wall, and a trap door in the ceiling leads back up to the outside.

At the very edge of your light's glow, you can just make out a horribly
suggestive shape lying in the shadows behind the furnace.

>x shape
It's the dead body of a woman. Her head has been raggedly hacked away, and her
clothes above the waist are soaked through with blood. As you fight to control
your rising gorge, you note that the body cannot have been here for very long;
the decay, though bad, is not very far advanced. She must have been killed
within the last couple of days at most.

You find nothing further in the dead woman's pockets.

an old-fashioned iron key, a key to the house and a key to the cellar).

The pockets of your trenchcoat contain a teddy bear, a tattered drawing, a
strange metal flute, a puzzle box (which is open but empty), a towel, a gold
locket, a newspaper, a letter opener, an old tin (which is closed), an animal's
skull, a slip of paper, Michael's faculty card, a family album, a bundle of
soggy pages, a flashlight (providing light), a book of matches with six matches
left, a torn journal, your umbrella and a lantern.

The riser bends ominously under your weight but doesn't give. Panting, you haul

Broken Stairs
The stairs stop short about seven feet shy of the basement floor, the bottom-
most steps hanging suspended over an empty shaft that descends beyond sight into
the shadowy depths. What's left of the structure creaks and shifts uneasily
under your feet. At the top of the stairs to the north, a doorway opens onto the
ground floor of the church.

The creaking under your feet is getting louder.

From far below you hear the faint lapping of water.

A dim antechamber, opening onto the main chapel to the east. To the west, the
main doors to the church have been solidly nailed shut, and through a shadowy
doorway to the south you can see stairs leading down.

Piled in one dusty corner is a heap of old cloth.

>x cloth
It's a hooded robe, left in a rumpled heap on the floor.

From the stairwell behind you there is a sudden, painful shriek of nails ripping
out of stone, a loud, protracted splintering, and finally a thunderous crash
that seems to echo up the shaft from far below.

Chapel
Broken shards from the shattered the stained glass windows grits under your feet
as you step around rows of overturned pews. The dust and cobwebs have been busy
here, reclaiming another bit of this town's abandoned history. To the west lies
the vestibule; to the east, a small doorway behind the pulpit leads to the back
of the church.

The big wooden cross that once hung above the pulpit has fallen, split in half.

On the pulpit is a huge, black tome.

>x cross
From the way it fell, it looks as though it must have been hung upside-down.

>x windows
The stained-glass windows are old and coated with grime, and many of the panels
have been broken out by time and vandals. Enough remains for you to make out
most of the designs depicted in them, however -- and you find them vaguely
disturbing. Saints -- at least none of the saints you're aware of -- should not
be depicted performing such acts, nor with such insidious leers on their faces
as they perform them.

>x tome
It lies open atop the pulpit, thicker than an unabridged dictionary. Its
thousands of yellowed, crinkly pages are bound in a strange black material that
looks like some kind of hide but clearly isn't leather. Your first thought was
that it might be a Bible, but a glance is sufficient to tell you otherwise. The
text within is arranged in two columns, the first in what looks like Latin, the
second a translation in English. There are illustrations, as well: horrible
icons that make your skin crawl to look at.

>save
Ok.

>read tome
As you lean closer over the pages to make out the words in this dim light, the
letters seem to writhe and crawl across the page, twisting themselves into
strange combinations, horrible words that you've never read before... and yet,
somehow, you can understand their repulsive meaning. Something about a "Blessed
Event",  which will happen very soon, and a hideous god whose name may not be
spoken...

Is this the book that was preached in this church before it fell to ruin? Are
these the gods these people worshipped? You want to tear your eyes from the page
in revulsion, but some small, gleefully filthy part of you wants to keep
reading, to uncover the secrets that the people of Anchorhead uncovered...

Will you read on?

>yes
As your hungry eyes lap up word after blasphemous word, it all becomes clear to
you: you come to understand the true nature of He Who Is Named Not, and what the
Verlacs were trying to accomplish all these years, preparing the people of
Anchorhead for the Blessed Event... it all makes sense to you now.

You step back, smiling, from the podium. There's no need to be afraid, you
realize, for neither yourself nor your husband are in any danger. It's all
right. It all makes sense. And when you raise your hands to your face and slowly
push the fingernails of your first and middle fingers into each eye, digging the
soft, bloody tissue out and dragging it down your cheeks in ropy smears... why,
that's all right, too.

It's the most natural thing in the world.

Behind the Chapel
This little room behind the chapel is hardly bigger than a broom closet. A
ladder bolted to the wall leads up through a hatch, presumably up into the
steeple.

>x ladder
It's an ordinary wooden ladder.

>up

Steeple
A tiny space inside the tip of the church's steeple, barely five feet across,
the walls tapering to only two feet across some twelve feet above your head.
There is a narrow window, but it seems to have been painted black at some point.
The only exit seems to be the ladder from which you just emerged.

An old length of rope dangles down from a square hole cut in the ceiling.

>x rope
It's about twenty feet long, frayed in a few places but still sturdy enough.

>up
You haul yourself up onto the rope, bringing your whole weight to bear. It holds
for about three seconds -- then there is a sharp snap from above you and a
muffled clank. The rope falls, spilling you to the floor amidst an untidy tangle
of coils.

Broken Stairs
The stairs are completely gone, now. All that's left is a narrow ledge
overlooking an empty shaft, and a fair portion of the railing still nailed to
the wall.

>save
Ok.

>drop robe in shaft
The hooded robe drops down out of sight, and a few seconds later you hear a
faint splash.

>tie rope to railing
You tie the rope securely to the railing, letting the other end dangle down into
the dark shaft.

>down
Gripping the end of the rope tightly, you lower yourself off the edge and shimmy
down into the darkness.

Hanging From the Rope
Your feet dangle over empty space. Looking down, you can barely make out a faint
glimmer of water, far below.

>drop rope
You take a deep breath, shut your eyes tight, say a quick prayer... and let go
of the rope.

The heart-stopping plunge lasts only a second or two before you hit shockingly
cold water. Your flashlight goes out and blackness envelopes you. Water rushes
into your mouth and nose; the stone bottom slams into your side and nearly
knocks the wind out of you... and then you find your feet, and your head breaks
the surface. Blindly, you thrash about until you find higher ground, and you
crawl, choking and sputtering, feeling cold brick beneath your fingers.

Darkness
It is pitch dark, and you can't see a thing.

Your score has just gone up by two points.

>turn on flashlight
The flashlight must not be quite as waterproof as you originally thought; the
beam flickers unsteadily, and you have to bang it against the palm of your hand
a couple of times to get it to work.

Vaulted Tunnel
The walls of this long, rectangular chamber are made of crumbling brick, not
concrete; most likely it was built at some earlier period than the rest of the
tunnels. The ceiling is lost in darkness above you, but from the sounds of the
echoes it must be pretty high. Water flowing in from the northwestern tunnel has
pooled in a depression sunk into the limestone floor, becoming quite deep near
the far end.

The shattered wreckage of the church stairway lies half submerged in the water-
filled depression. You're lucky to have missed it in your fall.

You can also see a hooded robe here.

>get robe
Taken.

>nw

Sewer Tunnel
The tunnel is ankle-deep in brackish water, though raised walkways on either
side provide relatively dry footing. The walls are slick, the air damp and foul.
The main tunnel runs north and southeast. Numerous smaller pipelines lead in all
directions, but all are too small for you to crawl through. Iron rungs embedded
in the wall lead up through an access shaft, back to the surface.

>n

Dripping Tunnel
The ceiling in this north-south tunnel is so low you must bend nearly double to
navigate it. Water drips endlessly through the walls and ceiling, seeping in
through thousands of invisible fissures, the constant plip-plip-plipping echoing
loudly throughout the tunnel. The air is so damp you can hardly breathe. Unless
your sense of direction is mistaken, you must be crossing the Miskaton River --
underneath it.

>n

Broken Tunnel
This looks to be an older part of the sewer system that has fallen into
disrepair. Many of the pipes here have crumbled and are filled with debris.

Set in the low ceiling is an old iron hatch.

>x hatch
It's a rectangle of corroded metal, just over a foot long on each side. There
are hinges along one edge on this side; if you could get your fingers under the
opposite edge, you could probably pry it open.

>open hatch
You dig your fingers under the edge and tug, but the hinges are rusted nearly
solid. You can't make it budge.

>open tin
(first taking the old tin)
You open the old tin, revealing a smelly quantity of fish oil.

>put oil on hatch
(first getting some fish oil)
You dip your finger in and come up with a small glob of pungent fish oil.

You rub a good amount of fish oil all over the rusty hinges.

>close tin
You close the old tin.

The flashlight beam flickers uncertainly for a moment, then comes back a bit
weaker than before.

>open hatch
The oiled hinges give a little, allowing you to wiggle your fingers further
under the door's edge. A sharp tug -- and the door swings down suddenly,
spilling filthy water into your face.

>u

Outflow Tunnel
From the smell of it, this must be a sewage outflow tunnel. Filthy water swirls
past a metal grate to the west and eddies around your hands and knees, on which
you are forced to crawl in this cramped cylindrical passageway. To the east, the
tunnel narrows still further, terminating about twenty feet further in a circle
of dim light.
Much of the water is pouring through an open hatch set in the floor of the
tunnel.

>e
You reach the end of the pipe and wriggle your way out, dropping awkwardly to
the sand.

Narrow Beach
This narrow strip of beach is tucked away between two outcroppings in the
predominantly rocky shoreline, accessible only from a steep, muddy slope to the
west. The sand is filthy and strewn with rocks, seaweed, litter and other bits
of storm-tossed detritus.

Near the bottom of the slope, a sewage outflow pipe juts out over the beach,
about three feet above the ground. A thin stream of acrid-smelling sewer water
trickles out over the lip of the pipe, forming a puddle in the sand.

>turn off flashlight
You switch the flashlight off.

>w
You pick your way up the slope, push the loose board aside and slip back in
through the gap.

Alley
This narrow aperture between two buildings is nearly blocked with piles of
rotting cardboard boxes and overstuffed garbage cans. Ugly, half-crumbling brick
walls to either side totter oppressively over you. The alley ends here at a
tall, wooden fence.

High up on the wall of the northern building there is a narrow, transom-style
window. One of the garbage cans has been pushed up against the wall directly
underneath it.

Outside the Real Estate Office
A grim little cul-de-sac, tucked away in a corner of the claustrophobic tangle
of narrow, twisting avenues that largely constitute the older portion of
Anchorhead. Like most of the streets in this city, it is ancient, shadowy, and
leads essentially nowhere. The lane ends here at the real estate agent's office,
which lies to the east, and winds its way back toward the center of town to the
west. A narrow, garbage-choked alley opens to the southeast.

Pallid gray light trickles in through the drawn blinds. The office is deserted,

Sitting on the corner of the paper-strewn desk are a telephone and an answering
machine.

Someone seems to have left a cup of coffee sitting out, half-finished and cold.

You pick up the hastily written letter. It consists of several pages torn from a
yellow legal pad and stapled in the corner; each page is covered on both sides,
top to bottom, with erratic, frightened handwriting. It is dated two days ago --
the day you arrived in Anchorhead.

It consists of several pages torn from a yellow legal pad and stapled in the

Anchorhead.

>read hastily written letter
The letter reads:

"To whom it may concern --

"My name is Claudia Benson, and I attest that I am of sound mind and body, at
least for what little time I have left.

"If you are reading this anywhere within the city limits of Anchorhead, be aware
that your life is in grave and immediate danger. Nearly all of the inhabitants
of this city are members of a secret cult that has thrived since before the
first settlers arrived here in the early 1600s and is still strong today. Its
members are fanatical and quite insane, and will kill anyone who learns their
secrets. I received a phone call early this morning which I believe is a threat
to my life; I assume the cult somehow discovered that I was planning to divulge
information to an outsider and now plans to silence me. In case I don't make it,
I am leaving this testimony for someone to find; hopefully it will be someone
who can put a stop to this madness once and for all.

"The cult originally evolved from the rituals of the ancient Misquat Indian
tribe that once lived in this region. Although this tribe is now extinct, its
beliefs have been passed down relatively unchanged through generations of
settlers for nearly four centuries. These beliefs center around the worship of
some sort of demon or god from the outer reaches of space, which visited the
earth millions of years ago and will return some day to wreak terrible
destruction. I am unclear on the exact details as there is very little
historical information available on this tribe, unless the University is hiding
material from me, which I am half-convinced it may well be.

"The ringleaders of this cult are and have always been the Verlac family. Every
second generation a male Verlac is born, and the role of high priest is passed
down from grandfather to grandson, following some arcane ritual of ascension.
There is a persistent legend that this ritual somehow involves a transmigration
of souls -- that, in fact, all male Verlacs are actually the reincarnation of
the original founder of the American line. Although this is obviously nothing
more than local superstition, the legend has such a hold on the people of the
region that it may have become a self-perpetuating delusion on the part of the
members of the Verlac family, each male child honestly believing that he is his
own grandfather reborn. Edward Verlac rejected this obscene birthright, and I
believe that the townspeople drove him to insanity for it.

"Regardless of the truth behind these legends, the cult is planning to act very
soon. In the 1920s, Edward's grandfather Mordecai Verlac began preaching that
the return of the 'Nameless God' was imminent -- specifically, that it would
occur the day after tomorrow. He re-opened the defunct paper mill, converting it
into a factory to build some sort of device, a 'beacon' with which to facilitate
the Nameless God's entry into this world. This device is very nearly finished,
and in two days they will be ready to enact their great ritual -- what they call
the 'Blessed Event'. It will most likely entail the wholesale slaughter of every
non-cultist man, woman and child in the city. The child abductions of the past
few years were most likely preparatory sacrifices perpetrated by the cult, and
there is no reason to believe that the killing will stop once their great ritual
is complete.

"If you are, in fact, the young man who planned to move into the Verlac estate,
you must be careful. The cult is almost certainly watching your every move, and
will attempt to induct and brainwash you into their cult or, failing that,
murder both you and your wife. I had hoped to warn you upon your arrival;
however, as the message on my answering machine this morning attests, I don't
have much time left. With any luck, I'll be out of the city by tonight. If I
don't make it, please try to stop these people. This key might help -- I managed
to dig it out our old property file on the lighthouse. I know they consider that
building important for some reason. Do what you can with it. And be careful.
These cultists are a menace, inbred and insane to the last man, and no one will
be safe until they are wiped off the face of the earth.

"Good luck, and be careful.

      -- Claudia Benson"

Narrow Street
As the lane winds along from east to west, it narrows until the steep, jagged
rooftops on either side of the street practically touch each other. To the
south, a side street leads across Whateley Bridge toward the center of town, and
a twisting lane leads up a hill to the northwest. A short flight of steps to the
north leads down to the local watering hole.

There appears to be a commotion of sorts to the south, where a group of
townsfolk have gathered.

>w

Junction
To the north, a gap in the crowded press of gloomy buildings opens onto a
country lane, heading out over a grassy heath. The main street continues to the
east, while to the northwest, over the top of a steep rise, you can just make
out the vaulted rooftops of the university.

>n

Mill Road
The road carries you across a desolate heath of gray, windswept grass. To the
south, the black, jagged outline of Anchorhead's steep roofs and sharp, leaning
gables cuts across the horizon. The road forks here to the west and east,
heading across the railroad tracks in one direction, out toward the seashore in
the other.

>w
As you cross the railroad tracks, the air becomes warmer, more dingy, and
slightly more difficult to breathe.

Entrance to the Paper Mill
The road turns southwest here and runs squarely through the front entrance to
the old paper mill. A gate of heavy iron bars blocks the only opening into this
charred fortress, although an overgrown path leads around the wall to the south.
To the north, a rutted lane threads its way past a row of dilapidated shacks.

>n

Shanty Town
The road peters out at a wide clearing of rutted mud, flanked by uneven rows of
decrepit, clapboard shacks. The town is quiet, almost deserted; only a few bits
of loose tarpaper blowing listlessly in the wind betray the overall stillness.

The cold wind cuts through your clothes, chilling you to the bone.

>x shacks
All peeling paint, broken glass and missing shingles, the houses are poorly
built and teetering on the verge of falling apart completely. They are arranged
in a vague suggestion of rows on either side of the mud clearing, numbered #1
through #12 with those cheap little nail-up plastic numbers you can buy at
hardware stores. Presumably, these denote each shack's "street address".

Curtains twitch behind a grimy windowpane, and you glance over in time to see a
lean, suspicious face pulling back into the shadows.

>knock on door 11
After a moment or two of silence, you hear a furtive rattling, and the door
opens a crack to reveal a woman's pale and haggard face. She stares out you with
a mixture of trepidation and mistrust.

In the distance, you can hear the lonesome keening of a train whistle drifting
on the wind. You look to the east in time to see the train go by, rolling
southwest past the mill toward less melancholy climes.

A pair of starving dogs come sniffing around the refuse by one of the shacks,
but as soon as you move they shy away, disappearing over the edge of the
clearing.

>x woman
She is pale and thin from lack of food. Her hair is prematurely gray. The dismal
poverty and constant fear that she has lived in all her life have leached her
body of its youth, leaving her aged before her time, stooped and scarred with
worry. She clutches a tattered shawl, its fabric the faded color of old
dishwater, close around her throat, and she watches you the way a wounded rabbit
might watch a potentially hungry cat.

Flakes of ash drift gently down from the sky like gray snow, coating everything
with a thin layer of soot.

>ask woman about jeffrey
The woman grows even paler, and draws back from the door with a look of
horrified loss.

Suddenly the woman slams the door shut, and you hear the rattle of a bolt being
drawn.

>knock on door 11
After a moment or two of silence, you hear a furtive rattling, and the door
opens a crack to reveal a woman's pale and haggard face. She stares out you with
a mixture of trepidation and mistrust.

>show bear to woman
(first taking the teddy bear)
(slipping the old tin into the pocket of your trenchcoat to get a hand free)
The woman's eyes widen in sudden recognition, and she takes the teddy bear from
you, turning it over to read the name stitched on the back. Tears well up in her
eyes, spilling over onto her pale, sunken cheeks. "This is my boy's," she
whispers. "This is Jeffrey's."

She looks at you suddenly. "Where did you find this? Did you find..." but then
she stops. She can see from your face that you have not found her son, only this
one clue. But... even one clue, however tenuous, offers possibility. And the
woman's face softens, just a little bit, with something that you guess hasn't
made its home there in a very, very, long time:

Hope.

"Come in," she says softly. "Thank you for bringing me this. Please, come in."

She steps aside from the door, and you enter her home.

#11 Mill Town Road
A dirty, ramshackle home, scraped together out of the bits and ends of working-
class poverty. The floor is warped and broken wood, bare dirt showing through
the cracks between boards. Rags hang across the window in lieu of curtains. Over
in the far corner is a rickety old stove; in the opposite corner a threadbare
cot; it hits you suddenly that a family of three once lived, slept and ate all
in this single room, which is slightly smaller than your bedroom back at the
house.

The woman watches you expectantly.

On the threadbare cot is a teddy bear.

A set of grime-smeared overalls hangs on a hook next to the front door to the
west.

Your score has just gone up by two points.

the name "Max".

>look in overalls
In the overalls is a long steel key.

That key might just come in handy; while the woman is looking in the other

The woman attempts a wan smile as you make ready to leave. "Thank you," she says
softly, indicating the stuffed bear. "If you discover anything else, please let
me know."

Shanty Town
The road peters out at a wide clearing of rutted mud, flanked by uneven rows of
decrepit, clapboard shacks. The town is quiet, almost deserted; only a few bits
of loose tarpaper blowing listlessly in the wind betray the overall stillness.

>s

Entrance to the Paper Mill
The road turns southwest here and runs squarely through the front entrance to
the old paper mill. A gate of heavy iron bars blocks the only opening into this
charred fortress, although an overgrown path leads around the wall to the south.
To the north, a rutted lane threads its way past a row of dilapidated shacks.

>s
The path curves southwest, leading you into an overgrown area behind the mill.

Bare Foundations
The foundations of an older structure lie crumbling in a sunken square of
ground, hidden away behind the imposing shadow of the mill wall. Weeds push up
through cracked and buckling slabs of concrete; twisted rebar and rusting pipes
poke up like the legs of dead insects. The ruins are surrounded on all sides by
dense thickets, although narrow, overgrown trails lead northeast and southeast
through the underbrush.

>x ruins
The broken rubble is all that remains of whatever building once stood here.

>search thicket
Carefully pushing the prickly branches aside, you find a rusty metal hatch set
into the base of the wall.

>unlock hatch
You go through all the keys on your keyring, trying each one in turn, and after
several false attempts you discover that the long steel key fits the lock.
You unlock the metal hatch.

>get lantern
Taken.

>turn on flashlight
The flashlight must not be quite as waterproof as you originally thought; the

a couple of times to get it to work.

Maintenance Access Tunnel
You are at the southern end of a long, narrow crawlway leading northward into
the mill. All around you, through the metallic walls, you can hear the
oppressive thumping and grinding of heavy machinery. The air in here is hot and
smells of burnt engine oil.

A large metal valve wheel juts out from the middle of one of the many fat,
sweating pipes lining the walls. Just to its left is a gauge of some sort.

The noise of machinery is growing steadily louder.

>x wheel
It's a large, spoked metal wheel, about a foot in diameter, for opening and
shutting a valve somewhere inside the pipes.

The machines behind the walls are reaching a feverish pitch, and an unpleasant
vibration ripples up and down the crawlway.

>wait
Time passes.

Just as the mechanical noises reach a crescendo, the pipes at the north end of
the crawlway suddenly give vent to an enormous gout of superheated steam. The
entire north half of the crawlway is momentarily filled with vapor and intense
heat, which just as quickly dissipates. The noise behind the walls recedes to a
calmer level, and the needle on the gauge swings back down to zero.

The hatch is round and quite sturdy-looking. There is a handle on this side, and

up there from here.

A long chain dangles from overhead, its last few feet pooled on the floor next
to a bank of controls.

>x vats
The machines squat like gigantic mechanical trolls all around you, ceaselessly
clanking, groaning, vibrating and spitting steam.

Strange; although you could hardly call yourself acquainted with the workings of
a paper mill, you can't help but notice that none of the machines you can see
seem to be involved with anything like the making of paper. At any rate, you
don't see any paper -- or any wood pulp, or any dye, or anything else you might
reasonably assume a paper mill would have on hand -- anywhere. The machines are
definitely busy churning out something -- but what?

>x catwalk
You needn't worry about that.

>look up
You can just make out the system of pulleys through which the chain is threaded,
way up at the ceiling.

>x chain
It runs all the way up past the catwalk to the ceiling. Its links look somewhat
greasy.

>climb up on chain
You can't see any such thing.

>up
You can't go that way.

>climb

You won't get very far climbing that.

>climb chain
The chain is too greasy for you to get a good grip on it.

>tie chain on me
You wrap the chain around your waist a few times.

>x controls
The waist-high bank has all number of arcane lights, dials and gauges on it;
however, the only two controls that bear mentioning are a lever and a large red
button.

>x lever
The lever juts out about a foot from the panel.

>x button
It's a large button, colored bright red.

>push button
The control panel emits a nasty buzzing sound.

>push button
The control panel emits a nasty buzzing sound.

>pull lever
You feel something click as the lever activates a hidden releasing mechanism;
then, suddenly, the chain pulls taut and jerks you off your feet, hauling you up
through the air -- narrowly missing a piece of heavy equipment sailing past you
on its way down -- all the way up to the catwalk, where the chain slows and
finally stops, depositing you safely, though left somewhat breathless, on the
grilled surface.

Catwalk
The catwalk stretches north, a narrow ribbon of metal grillwork dangling fifty
feet over the factory floor and shuddering dangerously in time with the machines
beneath it. There are no railings of any kind. At the far end you can see what
looks like a wide balcony with several large banks of equipment.

your waist.

Workshop
Several workbenches and racks of arcane electronic equipment have been dragged
together to form a sort of open laboratory on this wide balcony overlooking the
mill. A wide table dominates the area, strewn with precision tools, bits of
wire, and scribbled calculations. To the south, a narrow catwalk hangs above the
mill floor, and a metal ladder leads down into the machinery below.

Prominent among the strange tools scattered across the table is a strange
caliper-like instrument.

On the workbenches are some notes and some arcane electronic equipment.

One of the racks contains a number of circular mirrors, stacked side by side
like dishes in a dishwasher.

Tacked up on the wall is a large technical blueprint.

>x workbenches

technical data, tangled diagrams and complex formulae. Even if you had the
slightest idea what all the calculations meant, the numbers are barely even
legible.

Lifting up a sheet of cribbed equations, you notice what looks to be a general
memo to all mill workers.

>read memo
It's a flimsy sheet of paper with the following message printed on it:

!!NOTICE TO ALL BRETHREN!!
The focusing mirrors must be kept absolutely clean at ALL TIMES. Even the
slightest smudge of dirt or grease can create dangerous instabilities in the
refraction patterns.

All mirrors must receive ionization treatment as a matter of course. As an extra
precaution, however, always use sterilized surgical gloves when handling them.

In the Name of He Who Is Named Not,
the Mgt.

>x blueprint
The blueprint is a technical schematic for some extremely complicated device,
the exact purpose of which is anything but clear. It looks a bit like a
telescope, a bit like a microwave oven turned inside out, and a bit like the
"industrial laser" from Goldfinger. The inner workings of the device involve a
complicated arrangement of lenses and mirrors and a hopeless tangle of circuitry
that vaguely resembles several dozen street maps of Manhattan laid across each
other. Some of the notations on the circuitry don't even look like technical
symbols; they look more like cabbalistic runes.

Next to what must represent the main focusing mirror of the device, someone has
written the number "0.0113"; someone else, in another handwriting, has scratched
that number out and written below it, "0.0157".

Made of stainless steel, molded in a strangely flowing, almost organic design,
the calipers -- if that is what they are -- resemble no other tool you've ever
seen. It has three independently adjustable arms, each ending in a needle-point
pincer, which fold back on themselves at grotesque, asymetrical angles toward a
floating center point. There is a calibrated readout set near the base, which
presumably provides a measure of whatever strange contortion of space is
occupied by whatever object is placed between the pincers at the tool's other
end.

up there from here.

A large block of heavy equipment sits here next to the control bank, attached to
the end of the chain.

>s

Maintenance Access Tunnel
The north end of the access crawlway ends at a sturdy metal hatch. A thick haze
of steam hangs in the air, and the heat is like an oven -- the walls and floor
are almost blistering to the touch.

The hatch is open.

>s

Maintenance Access Tunnel
You are roughly at the center of the access crawlway, which stretches north and
south from here.

>s

Maintenance Access Tunnel
You are at the southern end of a long, narrow crawlway leading northward into
the mill. All around you, through the metallic walls, you can hear the
oppressive thumping and grinding of heavy machinery. The air in here is hot and
smells of burnt engine oil.

A large metal valve wheel juts out from the middle of one of the many fat,
sweating pipes lining the walls. Just to its left is a gauge of some sort.

>s

Bare Foundations
The foundations of an older structure lie crumbling in a sunken square of
ground, hidden away behind the imposing shadow of the mill wall. Weeds push up
through cracked and buckling slabs of concrete; twisted rebar and rusting pipes
poke up like the legs of dead insects. The ruins are surrounded on all sides by
dense thickets, although narrow, overgrown trails lead northeast and southeast
through the underbrush.

Set into the base of the mill wall, nearly covered by the thickets, is a metal
hatch.

>ne
The path curves to the north, leading you around to the front of the mill.

Entrance to the Paper Mill
The road turns southwest here and runs squarely through the front entrance to
the old paper mill. A gate of heavy iron bars blocks the only opening into this
charred fortress, although an overgrown path leads around the wall to the south.
To the north, a rutted lane threads its way past a row of dilapidated shacks.

>sw
(opening the gate first)
It seems to be locked.

>open gate
It seems to be locked.

>unlock gate
(first taking the keyring)
You go through all the keys on your keyring, trying each one in turn, but none
of the keys seem to fit.

>x mill
The paper mill is a sprawling, box-like conglomeration of soot-stained brick,
surmounted by blackened stumps of smokestacks that continuously belch fat,
rolling clouds of smoke into the leaden sky.

>e
As you cross the railroad tracks, the air seems to lift slightly, becoming more
breathable once again.

Mill Road
The road carries you across a desolate heath of gray, windswept grass. To the
south, the black, jagged outline of Anchorhead's steep roofs and sharp, leaning
gables cuts across the horizon. The road forks here to the west and east,
heading across the railroad tracks in one direction, out toward the seashore in
the other.

A distant flicker of movement draws your eyes to the faraway lighthouse. A lone
figure, tiny in the distance, makes its way stealthily around the small spur of
rock at the end of the breakwater and slips inside the door at the tower's base.
It's impossible to see the person's face from this distance, but the hair, the
way he walks... you'd swear it was Michael.

>e
The road heads out over a narrow breakwater jutting out into the ocean.

Breakwater
You are picking your way across the breakwater's bare, rocky spine, where the
road has diminished to little more than a pair of dusty ruts. A hundred yards to
the northeast, at the breakwater's far end, the lonely stone tower of
Anchorhead's lighthouse stands vigil against the ocean.

>ne

At the Foot of the Lighthouse
You stand in a circular clearing among the stones, surrounded on nearly every
side by the sea. Before you looms the ancient, massive lighthouse, a vertiginous
pillar of pale brick jabbing defiantly up at the sky. The road from the
southwest ends here, although it looks as though you could pick your way down
the rocks to the southeast, around the structure's base.

The great bronze door of the lighthouse stands slightly ajar, revealing a narrow
rectangle of blackness within.

>e

Bottom of the Lighthouse
The sound of the ocean is muffled behind the thick cinderblock walls, and the
air is damp and heavy. You can almost feel the weight of two hundred feet of
hoary old whitewashed brick pressing down on you from above. To the west, a
narrow strip of dim light marks the exit. Cracked concrete steps lead up.

>inv
You are wearing your trenchcoat, your clothes, a silver locket and your wedding
ring; in addition, you have in your hands a keyring, on which are eight keys (a
long steel key, a tarnished bronze key, a small steel key, an old-fashioned
brass key, a small copper key, an old-fashioned iron key, a key to the house and
a key to the cellar), a lantern (providing light) and a hooded robe.

The pockets of your trenchcoat contain the mirror labeled #2, an old tin (which
is closed), a blueprint rolled into a loose tube, a printed memo, a pair of
calipers, a book of matches with five matches left, a towel, a hastily written
letter, a flashlight, a meat hook, a tattered drawing, a strange metal flute, a
puzzle box (which is open but empty), a gold locket, a newspaper, a letter
opener, an animal's skull, a slip of paper, Michael's faculty card, a family
album, a bundle of soggy pages, a torn journal and your umbrella.

>put robe in coat
No matter how tightly you roll up the heavy robe, it is still too big to fit in
your pocket.

>up
You climb the winding stairs in a gradual spiral around the inner circumference
of the tower, and finally emerge, breathless, at the top.

Top of the Lighthouse
The stairs give onto a wide, circular chamber surrounded by windows. The glass
is old and streaked with grime, but you still have to catch your breath at the
magnificence of the view. In one direction, the dying heath and the stunted
cluster of buildings that is Anchorhead; in the other, the ocean like a vast,
undulating blanket.

Sitting in the middle of the room is what looks like a swivel mount of some
kind, although nothing is mounted on it now. Looking up, you see that it rests
directly below a large, hexagonal skylight.

>x mount
The mounting is ring-shaped, about three feet in diameter, and is designed to
allow whatever is to be mounted on it to turn freely in all directions. It was
probably originally intended to hold the beacon when the lighthouse was still in
operation.

>x skylight
That big, churning hole in the sky is perfectly framed by the hexagonal
skylight.

>x glass
(the lantern)
It's an old-fashioned hurricane lamp, with a tall glass chimney to protect it
from the wind. The cotton wick burns fitfully in its reservoir of cheap oil.

>x windows
The view -- which encompasses the ocean, the heath, the town of Anchorhead and
even the distant paper mill -- is magnificent.

The great, gray ocean stretches out as far as you can see, merging with the
clouds on the horizon.

The great, gray ocean stretches out as far as you can see, merging with the

You hastily descend the winding steps to the bottom.

Bottom of the Lighthouse
The sound of the ocean is muffled behind the thick cinderblock walls, and the
air is damp and heavy. You can almost feel the weight of two hundred feet of
hoary old whitewashed brick pressing down on you from above. To the west, a
narrow strip of dim light marks the exit. Cracked concrete steps lead up.

There is a faint scuffing noise from the shadows behind you -- before you can
turn around, something slams into the back of your head with brutal force.
Sparks go off in front of your eyes, and you fall to the cool concrete floor
with the world reeling under you. As you kneel there, dazed and struggling not
to pass out, your assailant walks slowly around you. He pauses, as if wondering
whether or not to finish you off.

Terror and nausea wash over you in alternating waves. You are too weak to look
up and see his face, but you recognize his shoes easily enough. After all, you
helped him pick them out not three weeks ago.

More footsteps come down the stairs, and you sense a number of men standing
around you. "We'll take care of her, Your Holiness," rasps an old, weathered
voice. Rough hands start to drag you to your feet.

"No," says Michael, and the hands pause.

"Your Holiness, she has seen too much," protests the raspy voice. "She must be
killed."

"That won't be necessary," Michael says. "Put her somewhere out of the way,
where she can't get into any more trouble. I'll deal with her myself... after
the Blessed Event."

The horror and pain are too much; the darkness overwhelms you. You try to catch
a glimpse of your husband's face as the men drag you away, but in your clouding
vision all you can see are a pair of burning, red-rimmed eyes...




[           * THE LAST NIGHT *
  
  The most merciful thing in the world, I
  think, is the inability of the human
  mind to correlate all its contents. We
  live on a placid island of ignorance in
  the midst of black seas of infinity,
  and it was not meant that we should
  voyage far... but some day the piecing
  together of dissociated knowledge will
  open up such terrifying vistas of
  reality, and of our frightful position
  therein, that we shall either go mad
  from the revelation or flee from the
  deadly light into the peace and safety
  of a new dark age.
  
  -- H.P. Lovecraft]




Numb.

You float slowly to consciousness like a bubble rising to the surface of some
warm, thick oil. You are numb.

For several minutes, that is as much as your battered mind can handle, that one
thought: you are numb.

Then your head becomes a bit clearer, and you connect the thought with the
sensations trying to make their way through your foggy brain. You are numb. Your
arms. You can't feel your arms at all.

You try to get up but you can't move; you merely flop over onto your stomach
like a struggling worm. You roll back over and sit up, and at last your vision
clears and you finally get a good look around, and the horror of your situation
finally slams home...

Padded Cell
You are in a padded cell, the kind typically reserved for raving lunatics. The
room is barely eight feet by eight feet square, with walls and floor of concrete
covered with thick, quilted padding. The door in the west wall is also covered
with padding, except for a tiny observation window about five feet up, from
which a feeble light trickles in.

>x walls
You can't see any such thing.

>x wall

>x door
It's a sturdy-looking wooden door, padded on the inside. There is a tiny
observation window about five feet up. The door is closed.

It looks like the door might be hanging a bit crooked on its hinges.

>look through windows
You can't see any such thing.

>look through window
You can see an empty hallway outside. Across the hall is another door.

>x window
The tiny window is made of thick, reinforced glass.

>break door
You take a few steps back, draw a deep breath, and hurl your body at the door.
It shudders violently, and you thought you felt something give.

An itch strikes you suddenly on the inside of your left elbow. For the next
minute or two you can only clench your teeth in agony, powerless to scratch it,
until the wretched sensation goes away on its own.

>break door
With a defiant shout, you launch your body at the door. Something snaps (the
door? you think incoherently, or your shoulder?), and the door flies open,
sending you sprawling out into the hallway.

Hallway
A grim hallway of concrete and industrial green tiles. This is the north end;
the hallway runs south from here. Doors lead east and west, and a narrow, barred
window to the north looks out onto the dark corner outside.

A shard of glass from the broken window lies on the floor.

>get glass
(the shard of glass)
Painstakingly, you get down on your knees and very, very carefully pick up the
shard of glass with your teeth.

>x window
Which do you mean, the observation window or the broken window?

>broken window
Building maintenance is obviously not a big priority at this institution. The
wall around the window casement is cracked in several places -- some of the
cracks are quite large. The window pane itself is broken in, probably by a
misguided bird sometime in the recent past.

>x cracks
A jagged network of cracks has spread out around the bottom edge of the window
as the wall slowly settles. One crack is nearly a quarter-inch wide.

>put glass in crack
(the shard of glass in the crack)
You wedge the shard of glass into the crack, its sharp edge pointing outward.

>cut jacket with glass
(the shard of glass)
Carefully, you lean back against the wall and start shrugging your shoulders
against the jutting glass shard. After what seems like an eternity, you feel the
straps begin to fray and loosen, until suddenly the strait jacket grows slack
and slips free. You shake the horrible garment off in disgust, giving it a
vicious kick for good measure as you gingerly rub feeling back into your arms.

Your score has just gone up by two points.

>x closet
The closet door is closed.

>open closet
You open the closet, revealing a silver locket, your trenchcoat, a hooded robe, 
a lantern and a keyring.

You hear strange, gibbering laughter coming from down the hall.

You put on the trenchcoat.

Hallway
A grim hallway of concrete and industrial green tiles. This is the north end;
the hallway runs south from here. Doors lead east and west, and a narrow, barred
window to the north looks out onto the dark corner outside.

There is a jagged shard of glass poking out of the wall here, underneath the
window.

You can also see a strait jacket here.

>x jacket
It's a canvas strait jacket, the kind used to immobilize violent or spastic
mental patients. It fastens up the back with a complex series of buckles and
straps, while the sleeves cross the chest and fasten around back, making it
quite impossible to escape. The thing is useless now, of course, since all the
straps have been cut through.

Something about the observation window in the western cell door catches your
eye; it looks like it has blood on it.

>x window
Which do you mean, the west observation window or the east observation window?

>west
The thick, reinforced glass of the tiny observation window is shattered, with
only the criss-crossing reinforcement wire holding it together. It bulges
outward slightly, as well. An ugly brown smear of dried blood obscures the inner
surface of the glass. With mounting disgust, you notice several strands of dark
hair still stuck to the congealed stain.

Padded Cell
Another padded cell, much like the rest. There is a door in the east wall.

The padding in this room seems a bit worse for the wear; murky bloodstains
spatter the canvas near the door, and there is a large tear down in the corner
of the cell, with bits of stuffing leaking out.

>x tear
The canvas is frayed and jaggedly torn. It looks as though someone might have
gnawed through it with their teeth.

>look in tear
In the ragged tear is a torn square of canvas.

>get square
(slipping the silver locket into the pocket of your trenchcoat to get a hand
free)
As you carefully pull the ragged piece of canvas from its hiding place,
something pricks you sharply on the finger. You jerk your hand away; then,
peering into the tear once again, you notice an old, crusted needle embedded in
the stuffing.

Your score has just gone up by two points.

>x square
It's roughly six inches to a side and covered front and back with uneven, barely
legible handwriting. The letters are the murky brown color of blood.

"My name is Edward Verlac, and this is my testament:

"I am utterly, utterly mad.

"They have locked me in here for my own safety -- and for the safety of others.
My arms are bound in a strait jacket. Yet this is no less than I deserve. I am
writing this using a needle dropped carelessly by one of the orderlies some
weeks ago; biting my lip to draw blood for the ink, I hold the tiny steel quill
beneath my teeth to write. This exhaustive task shall be my last on earth; when
I am finished, I shall dash my brains out against the cell window. The last of
the Verlacs will be dead, and the world made a slightly brighter place thereby.

"Know this: I did not slip into madness through any weakness or congenital
defect (except insofar as my blood is indelibly tainted with the cursed ichor of
the Verlac line) -- I was driven mad by the spectre of my great-great ancestor,
Croseus Verlac. For generations that fiend has traveled down the family line,
passing from body to body in a hideous, incestuous ritual whereby he impregnates
his own daughter, then projects his black soul into the innocent body of his
infant grandson. I myself was horrified to discover that I am in fact the
progeny of my own grandfather, Mordecai Verlac, and his wretched, tormented
daughter -- my mother, Anna. The experiment failed on the first attempt,
producing William, my sickly, malformed elder brother whom I never knew.
William, however, died while still a toddler -- or so my mother has always told
me -- and the next unholy coupling resulted in me.

"From as early as I can remember, I could feel the lurking presence of my
grandfather, who died the day I was born, and who I now realize was little more
than a fleshly disguise for the pernicious warlock Croseus. He stalked the
boundaries of my mind, seeking a means of entrance, of condemning my soul to
limbo and taking up a fresh, new abode in my young limbs. His evil, red-rimmed
eyes haunted my every dream and o'ershadowed even my waking hours. The amulet my
mother gave me while I was still in the crib protected me -- for the old man
cannot abide its presence, and must flee all who wear it -- but Mother died
while I was still young, and since then my folly has brought tragedy to myself
and to all those I love.

"The memory of my mother's urgent warnings faded soon after her death. I became
embarrassed by the scandal that seemed to hover over my family name like a pall,
and was mortified by the superstitious trinket that I still wore around my neck,
as if in ignorant servitude to those old myths. The red-rimmed eyes had not
given me nightmares since my twelfth birthday, and I dismissed them as an
immature fancy that had passed along with my boyhood. At the age of 21, I pawned
the amulet at a magic shop somewhere in town, and thereby sealed my doom.

"For ten years I have resisted Croseus' demonic encroachment upon my mind, my
soul, my very being, with only the strength of my will. It was not enough. I
found my mind flooded at the oddest times with strange, antiquarian memories; my
speech and mannerisms lapsed into uncharacteristic, archaic patterns; and worst
of all, I found myself looking at my dear daughter Gertrude -- only seven years
old! -- in the most unwholesome way, with the most unmentionable ideas creeping
through my subconscious.

"I scoured every street in this cursed town, looking for that magic shop, but I
have never found it. In desperation I began delving into old histories and
forbidden genealogies, researching the history of the dread Verlac name for some
solution to my plight. I discovered no answers, only the horrors I have just
written of. But I also discovered something worse -- the ultimate purpose behind
the old demon's nefarious bodysnatching!

"He plans to unleash a primordial evil such that the earth could not possibly
survive. I have seen the plans and the blueprints; I have read the dread tome in
my great-great grandfather's church; I have used the obsidian lens that is not
true obsidian, and I have looked upon what that madman means to draw down onto
this earth! He and this town, his foul congregation of fanatics and madmen! They
are all a part of it! They have been watching me, waiting for me to change,
waiting for the return of their monstrous high priest!!

"It was then that I realized that killing only myself would not be enough; for
the degenerate inhabitants of this town would hunt down my family and wreak a
terrible vengeance if I took from them their Messiah. And besides; who could say
whether the crafty devil Croseus might not concoct some new way to enter the
world, through a new body -- through that of one of my daughters, perhaps? The
ritual has always demanded a grandson, but Croseus was never one to let such a
trivial inconvenience stop him. He would find a way. He always returns to his
blood.

"I did the only thing I could do -- Julia, I am so terribly sorry, but I will be
with you soon -- I could not let him have you, or Gertrude or Sonia -- and I
will not let him have me. Say good-bye to the last of the Verlacs -- there will
be no blood for him once I am gone."

You are stopped halfway to the stairs by a loud banging noise behind you.

You turn around -- there it is again. A loud, shuddering bang, like something

Looks like someone else is trying out your brilliant escape plan.

The door is hit a third time, the latch snaps and the door flies open, and a
filthy, ragged man staggers out into the hall. You have just enough time to
notice -- with no small amount of disquiet -- that the man is not wearing a

Ugly, mint-green tiles and walls of whitewashed cinderblock comprise the decor
of this inhospitable waiting room. A hard little sofa upholstered in avocado
vinyl and a feebly struggling potted palm are provided for the comfort of

fortunate enough to have visitors. A metal gate bars entrance to a southern

Asylum Courtyard

like ranks of shriveled, empty eye sockets. You can escape through a narrow
gateway in the high, brick wall to the north.

The madman comes prancing out the front door of the asylum, and suddenly stops
dead in his tracks. He looks around, utterly dumbfounded. He looks up at the
sky, and feels the raindrops striking his face. Slowly it dawns on his addled
brain that he is outside; that he is, in fact, free.

With a wild whoop of pure joy, the madman hobbles away down the street, laughing
and chattering to himself with such unabashed happiness that for a moment you
almost forget that you have just let loose a dangerous and quite probably
homicidal psychotic into the world at large.

Then again, you think, in this town he might just fit right in.

Dark Corner
The rooftops above you lean so close together as to nearly block out the sky
altogether, making this a particularly dark and unpleasant section of the city.
The street leads away to the east, and a shadowy driveway leads through a high
brick wall to the south.

A sudden gust of wind suddenly snatches the umbrella from your hands.

Town Square
A wide expanse of uneven pavestones lies open to the sky, bordered on all sides
by the leaning, steep-roofed architecture that looms over everything in this
city. The municipal courthouse stands at the south end of the square, next to
the mouth of a dark, narrow alley to the southwest. Avenues to the west and east
lead back into the cramped and ingrown streets, while to the north lies Whateley
Bridge.

In the center of the square, rising from a circular lawn of unhealthy-looking
grass and weeds, stands a strange, stone obelisk. It seems to be a monument of
some sort, although you can see no plaque or marker anywhere near it.

As you step into the open square you hear a sudden commotion -- several crowds
of people are converging onto the town square from different directions. You can
hear their shouts and see the flickering glow of their torches as the mob begins
to swarm in from the north and east.

>wait
Time passes.

The obelisk glows red with the bloody light of their torches. They are almost
here; you'd better find somewhere to hide, quickly.

>wait
Time passes.

Robed men brandishing torches pour into the square, rallying around the obelisk
at its center. Several of them seem to be struggling with someone. You huddle
back into the shadows, but  no one seems to notice yet another robed figure in
the midst of the crowd. For the moment, it seems, you are safe.

>wait
You wait, helplessly.

The struggling men step forward, and you can see they have the old bum from the
vacant lot. His wrists are bound and his arms held by two cultists on either
side. Although he screams and writhes with frantic desperation, the frail old
drunkard is no match for his captors. Someone raises his hands for silence --
you can't quite see him from where you are -- and the mob quiets down. Even the
old bum's screams lower to a fearful whimpering.

Overhead, the swollen clouds flicker ominously with a greenish haze of sheet
lightning.

>wait
You wait, helplessly.

"My brethren," intones the leader, "we are gathered here to mete out bloody
justice upon one who has sinned against us. This one," -- he jabs a finger at
the old bum -- "has divulged our secrets to an outsider and betrayed the sacred
trust of our brotherhood! For this, his soul must be condemned forever, embraced
and encysted within the necrotic folds of the Womb of Nehilim!"

At this, the crowd lets loose with a roar of approval, while the old bum throws
back his head and shrieks helplessly into the storm.

>wait
You wait, helplessly.

The cultists drag the bum over to the monument and prepare to lift him up.
Suddenly, he makes a break for it, bolting through the pressing crowd and
running, by some grotesque twist of luck, straight at you.

The old man stops short. The flickering torchlight illuminates your face, and
his eyes widen in recognition. He opens his mouth to speak...

And four burly cultists tackle him simultaneously, pulling him down. As the old
man's body hits the ground, a small, shiny object falls out of the bum's clothes
and bounces out across the cobblestones, unnoticed by all.

The cultists carry the bum back and lift him up onto the monument, hanging him
by the wrists from the iron ring set into its tip.

>put all in pocket
name tag: You slip the name tag into the pocket of your trenchcoat.
lantern: You slip the lantern into the pocket of your trenchcoat.

"Please," sobs the old man pitifully, "please, I didn't, I swear, I didn't tell
nobody nothing, so I didn't! I SWEAR TO GOD I DIDN'T TELL -- "

Before the poor old man can finish his plea, a dozen cultists brandishing long
metal rods begin brutally beating him. You avert your eyes; his screams are
quickly cut off as his ribs are staved in, and soon all you can hear are the
horrible thuds, and the wet snapping sound of breaking bones.

Your amulet is lying on the cobblestones a few yards away from the obelisk.
Apparently, it didn't give the old bum as much luck as he'd hoped.

The square is packed with an angry, screaming mob of cultists.

In the center of the square, rising from a circular lawn of unhealthy-looking
grass and weeds, stands a strange, stone obelisk. It seems to be a monument of
some sort, although you can see no plaque or marker anywhere near it.

Although it seems to go on forever, the slaughter is finished in less than a
minute. The crowd backs away, its cheering and chanting diminished to a low,
hypnotic murmur. The cultists quickly disperse back into the streets, and within
moments the square is once again empty... except for the mutilated thing hanging
from the obelisk.

>get amulet
You pick up the amulet, musing sadly that it must not have brought the poor old
bum as much luck as he'd hoped.

Whateley Bridge
A hoary monument of crumbling, moss-eaten flagstones, Whateley Bridge is
possibly older than any other structure in the entire city. Ponderously it spans
the dark, torpid waters of the Miskaton River, connecting the north and south
halves of the city and occasionally raining bits of gravel and mortar from its
underside into the water. It looks just wide enough for two cars to pass each
other between the flanking stone parapets, but you wouldn't volunteer to try it.

As you approach the bridge, you see a hulking shadow lurking about on the far
bank. You slow down warily, remembering the townsfolk who threatened you
earlier, peering through the darkness and obscuring rain to catch a glimpse of
the person. Then the figure moves slightly, and you realize that it's much
larger than a man; in fact, the figure isn't shaped anything like a man at all.

A sudden crack of lightning illuminates the bridge for a brief, horrible instant
-- and in that instant, you see it.

In the next few moments, your battered mind manages to blot out the memory of
that bloated, barrel-like, armless trunk; those thick, double-jointed legs that
end in shiny black hooves; that writhing forest of fleshy tendrils crowning the
torso in place of a proper head -- but you are not, and will never be, able to
banish the horrible, searing memory of the thing's misplaced face which leers
madly out at you from the side of the trunk -- that child's face on a monster's
body!

A sizzling bolt of lightning cuts through the night sky, illuminating your
surroundings in a sudden sheet of blinding white radiance that leaves eerie,
green afterimages scarred onto your retinas.

The creature lurches toward you, its hooved feet thumping heavily on the old
stone bridge.

>give gold locket to creature
(first taking the gold locket)
You toss the gold locket at the monster's feet, and the clasp springs open when
it hits the cobblestones, revealing the woman's portrait inside. The creature
looks down and is immediately captivated. It bends over awkwardly, delicately
grasps the chain with the tip of one tentacle, and holds the locket up to its
face.

For a single heartbeat of time, even the storm seems to hold still. The little
boy's face gazes at the picture in the locket for a long, aching moment. And a
silent tear wells up in the corner of its eye and trickles down its cheek.

   *** ka-WHAM!!! ***

A monstrous clap of thunder rolls across the sky, shaking the whole town to its
foundations.

The monster ignores you for the moment, fascinated by the portrait of its
mother.

>hit creature with hook
(first taking the meat hook)
With a hoarse yell of desperation, you raise the meat hook over your head and
fly at the monster while its attention is absorbed by the tiny picture of its
mother.

It never even sees you coming. With brutal accuracy, you sink the meat hook deep
into the left eye of the little boy's face. It screams, a high, squawling wail
like a frightened infant, and a thick, black ichor spurts from the wound. It
thrashes about helplessly, knocking you onto the ground, and you scramble back
on your hands and feet crab-style, trying to get away from its struggles.

Another flash of lightning, and you see the thing stagger over to the side of
the bridge. One tentacle manages to pluck out the hook, which clatters to the
pavement -- but the damage has been done. The monster hits the stone parapet,
overbalances, and goes over the side, taking the locket with it. It hits the
water with a giant splash and is instantly engulfed by the raging current. By
the time you get to your feet, rush to the side and look over, the monster's
body is gone.

Narrow Street
As the lane winds along from east to west, it narrows until the steep, jagged
rooftops on either side of the street practically touch each other. To the
south, a side street leads across Whateley Bridge toward the center of town, and
a twisting lane leads up a hill to the northwest. A short flight of steps to the
north leads down to the local watering hole.

>w

Junction
To the north, a gap in the crowded press of gloomy buildings opens onto a
country lane, heading out over a grassy heath. The main street continues to the
east, while to the northwest, over the top of a steep rise, you can just make
out the vaulted rooftops of the university.

>n

Mill Road
The road carries you across a desolate heath of gray, windswept grass. To the
south, the black, jagged outline of Anchorhead's steep roofs and sharp, leaning
gables cuts across the horizon. The road forks here to the west and east,
heading across the railroad tracks in one direction, out toward the seashore in
the other.

A group of cultists passes you, heading north from the town.

The cultists, thinking you are one of their own, pass by silently.

>e
The road heads out over a narrow breakwater jutting out into the ocean.

Breakwater
You are picking your way across the breakwater's bare, rocky spine, where the
road has diminished to little more than a pair of dusty ruts. A hundred yards to
the northeast, at the breakwater's far end, the lonely stone tower of
Anchorhead's lighthouse stands vigil against the ocean.

The sea thrashes against the shore with storm-driven fury.

In the distance, you can hear the lonesome keening of a train whistle drifting
on the wind.

>ne

At the Foot of the Lighthouse
You stand in a circular clearing among the stones, surrounded on nearly every
side by the sea. Before you looms the ancient, massive lighthouse, a vertiginous
pillar of pale brick jabbing defiantly up at the sky. The road from the
southwest ends here, although it looks as though you could pick your way down
the rocks to the southeast, around the structure's base.

The sea thrashes against the shore with storm-driven fury.

The great bronze door of the lighthouse is closed.

>unlock door
(first taking the keyring)
You go through all the keys on your keyring, trying each one in turn, and after
several false attempts you discover that the tarnished bronze key fits the lock.
You unlock the massive bronze door.

The rain slackens off momentarily to a weak drizzle, then returns afresh in a
brief, freezing downpour.

>open it
With great effort, you manage to pull the ancient, creaking door open a few
inches, enough to slip through.

>e

Bottom of the Lighthouse
The sound of the ocean is muffled behind the thick cinderblock walls, and the
air is damp and heavy. You can almost feel the weight of two hundred feet of
hoary old whitewashed brick pressing down on you from above. To the west, a
narrow strip of dim light marks the exit. Cracked concrete steps lead up.

>up
You climb the winding stairs in a gradual spiral around the inner circumference
of the tower, and finally emerge, breathless, at the top.

Top of the Lighthouse
The stairs give onto a wide, circular chamber surrounded by windows. The glass
is old and streaked with grime, but you still have to catch your breath at the
magnificence of the view. In one direction, the dying heath and the stunted
cluster of buildings that is Anchorhead; in the other, the ocean like a vast,
undulating blanket.

Sitting in the middle of the room, beneath a large, hexagonal skylight, is the
most bizarre, incomprehensibly complicated device you have ever seen.

   *** ka-WHAM!!! ***

A monstrous clap of thunder rolls across the sky, shaking the whole town to its
foundations.

>x device
It looks a bit like a telescope, a bit like a microwave oven turned inside out,
and a bit like the "industrial laser" from Goldfinger. It's pointed almost
straight up, right through the skylight, aimed directly at the rumbling hole in
the sky. Its exact purpose is unfathomable, but it is emitting an ominous,
throbbing hum and radiating a curious warmth that causes an unwholesome
prickling sensation all over your skin.

Most of the exposed components are too complex to comprehend, but there is a
receptacle about two thirds of the way along the thing's -- er, "barrel" -- that
contains a round mirror, like a focusing mirror in a telescope. It looks as
though you could remove it.

>x mirror in device
You can't see any such thing.

>get mirror from device
Which do you mean, the real mirror or the mirror labeled #2?

>real mirror
The receptacle lets go of the mirror with a metallic click and a pneumatic hiss.

"Well, well; if it isn't the loyal wife."

You whirl around to find Michael standing in the doorway, flanked by two robed
guards who stare at you with a distinct glitter of malice in their eyes.

>put real mirror in coat
You slip the real mirror into the pocket of your trenchcoat.

Michael smirks as he advances on you. "You're quite a persistent little tart,
aren't you? Quite the gutsy little irritant. I suppose Michael must have been
one of those 'modern' men; didn't go in for the submissive type." Michael -- or
whatever fiend is speaking from behind Michael's face -- sneers. "Didn't have
the balls for it, is my guess. In my day, we knew how to keep our wives. A
headstrong woman should be broken in, just like a headstrong horse."

>x michael
He is someone else, now, someone you have never known and would never want to
know. His flesh is gaunt; his skin waxy and pale; his forehead burning and
feverish. And his eyes... you can't bear to look into the seething madness of
those wild, red-rimmed eyes. Your husband is gone, now -- some other, alien
force has devoured him from within and now animates his body.

Michael walks past you and runs his fingers along the strange device.

"My, my, you do keep busy," Michael remarks when he finds the focusing mirror
missing. "It's a good thing I caught you in time." He turns to you and holds out
his hand. "Your little game is over now, woman, and you've lost. Give me the
mirror now."

>x guards
The guards eye you with malice and a certain hunger, as if they were just
waiting for an excuse to tear you to pieces.

Michael glares at you with impatience. "Give me the mirror, woman," he hisses
into your face. "Don't make me damage you..."

>save
Ok.

>x michael's eyes
You can't see any such thing.

>x eyes
You can't see any such thing.

>give mirror 2 to michael
(first taking the mirror labeled #2)
"That's more like it," Michael says.

Michael pauses, glances down at the mirror in his hand, then smirks at you. "But
of course, there's no telling where else you've been poking around, what you
might have gotten your dirty little hands on, hmm?"

He leans in close to you, and you can smell corruption on his breath like
rotting oranges. "I've been wondering where this had gotten off to," he murmurs
in your ear, taking the caliper-like instrument from you. He applies the
instrument to the mirror, and frowns as he checks the readout.

Then he smiles.

"Well, that's that then," he says, placing the mirror back in its receptacle. He
nods toward the guards, who seize you and begin dragging you down the stairs.

"It's time to clue you in to just what's been going on around here," Michael
says, following behind you. "First hand. I think you'll find it quite...
enthralling."

You are dragged bodily down to the foot of the lighthouse and around to the
rocky outcropping, where an island of flesh floats just beyond the breakwater's
tip. The guards shove their way through the crowds of robed supplicants,
carrying you to the island's center. They force you to your knees and, despite
your best efforts at escape, manhandle you into a pair of handcuffs looped
through an iron ring set in a heavy stone block. The block is so low, you are
forced to remain kneeling in the squelchy muck, craning your neck to watch the
orgiastic ceremoney taking place... and your husband -- no, you tell yourself,
not your husband; the creature that your husband has become -- leading the
terrible rites.

Island of Flesh
The island is barely forty feet across, its surface covered with an ankle-deep
layer of slime and muck. Underneath the muck, the ground throbs -- heaving
rhythmically to a blasphemous, living pulse.

The sea thrashes against the shore with storm-driven fury.

The robed guards hover to either side of you, waiting for you to make a move.

Michael stands in the center of it all, leading the hellish rites.

Robed cultists crowd around on every side -- some of them brandishing flaming
torches, some of them chanting in some hideous, archaic tongue, all of them
swaying to the hypnotic pulse that rises up from the depths of the fleshy
ground.

You are handcuffed to one of several heavy stone blocks set in a rough
semicircle around the center of the island.

Lashed to a stake in the center of the island is a young boy.

>x island
The fleshy surface of this island is covered in reeking slime. It shivers
beneath you to some horrible pulse.

>x sea
The sea is the color of old pewter, surging and chopping restlessly beneath the
clouds.

Michael takes up a torch from one of the crowd. Holding it high above his head,
he turns to the lighthouse and intones:

"Iach! That Which May Not Be Named, I call upon Thee! Formless Drifter of the
Gulfs Between, I summon Thee!"

The crowd murmurs in ecstatic encouragement.

>x guards
The guards eye you with malice and a certain hunger, as if they were just
waiting for an excuse to tear you to pieces.

"I cast aside the Seals! I throw open the Gates!"

Michael traces a mystic sigil in the air in front of him with the flaming torch.
The flames seem to hang for a moment in strange patterns before twisting away
into nothing.

"OHODOS - SCIES - ABYSSON!"

The torch flares up with a roar, and the ocean waves seem to respond with
sudden, inexplicable fury, crashing brutally against the island.

The boy cries pitifully, his sobs going unheeded by the chanting cultists and
the raging storm.

>x michael
He is someone else, now, someone you have never known and would never want to

those wild, red-rimmed eyes. Your husband is gone, now -- some other, alien
force has devoured him from within and now animates his body.

Michael turns his back on the lighthouse, facing out to sea.

"To the East, where the Spawning Chaos seethes and suppurates within the
Crucible of Grum, from whose bursting pustules arise the Million Unseeable
Forms, I summon Thee!"

>x cultists
The throng of cultists presses around the small clearing in the middle of the
island from all directions, chanting, waving torches, and swaying rhythmically
to the terrible beat of whatever monstrous heart lies beneath this island.

Michael makes a quarter-turn to his left.

"To the North, where the Howling Hunger sweeps invisibly across the Yellow
Plains and gnaws upon the entrails of the pious, I summon Thee!"

A monstrous bolt of lightning licks down from the sky and strikes the sea just
north of the island, sending a spume of steam and boiling water fifty feet into
the shrieking sky. Screams of fear and rapture erupt throughout the pressing
crowd, almost inaudible beneath the deafening peal of thunder.

>x stone blocks
The stone is roughly cubical, nearly a foot along each side. There is a thick
iron ring embedded in one side which you are securely handcuffed to.

Michael isn't even fazed. He makes a half-turn to the right and continues:

"To the South, where the Seven Corpulent Sultans of Slaas'tha stand in judgment
over the Heretics of Kron, and force their vile copulations upon the repentant,
I summon Thee!"

Another lightning bolt, this time striking just south of the island, and another
spume of water. The crowd begins to writhe and gibber madly, like a single,
plasmic organism.

>x stake
The wood piled around the base of the stake, and the leather thongs knotted
firmly near the top, make it gruesomely clear that this is no campfire -- it's a
sacrificial pyre.

Michael makes a three-quarter turn to his left, coming all the way around to
face the lighthouse once more.

"To the Ultimate West, wherein lies the Void That Conquers All, I summon Thee!"

The top of the lighthouse begins to glow with an unwholesome, violet light. A
low, ominous vibration creeps up from the ground, crawling up through your bones
and reverberating painfully in your teeth.

>x boy
A skinny, tow-headed boy of eight or so, he bears all the markings of a recent
victim of trauma. His face is smudged with dirt, his wrists are raw and red from
the tight bindings, and his eyes are shadowed with deep, purple half-circles.
For all this, however, you instantly recognize his face from the newspaper
story: it's Jeffrey Greer, the boy who was kidnapped two days ago.

The air around the lighthouse is rippling now. Several cultists fall convulsing
to the mud; others are screaming in strange, strangled tongues. The earth
shakes, and the air is split by a high-pitched harmonic ringing, like a crystal
about to shatter.

Michael raises the torch, preparing to thrust it into the pyre at the child's
feet. He throws his head back and shrieks directly into the eye of the storm:

"IACH! PIOTH XENOBETHAKLES! ULUTUK FH'TAGHN!! BY THE KEYS OF IOK-SOTOT I NAME
THEE!

"!!! IALDABAOLOTH !!! COME FORTH !!!"

>x hands
You can't see any such thing.

>escape
That's not a verb I recognise.

>look

Island of Flesh
The island is barely forty feet across, its surface covered with an ankle-deep
layer of slime and muck. Underneath the muck, the ground throbs -- heaving
rhythmically to a blasphemous, living pulse.

The sea thrashes against the shore with storm-driven fury.

The robed guards hover to either side of you, waiting for you to make a move.

Michael stands in the center of it all, leading the hellish rites.

Robed cultists crowd around on every side -- some of them brandishing flaming
torches, some of them chanting in some hideous, archaic tongue, all of them
swaying to the hypnotic pulse that rises up from the depths of the fleshy
ground.

You are handcuffed to one of several heavy stone blocks set in a rough
semicircle around the center of the island.

Lashed to a stake in the center of the island is a young boy.

What happens next is rather unexpected.

The high-pitched ringing sound reaches a crescendo, and without warning the
upper half of the lighthouse explodes violently in a boiling fireball of violet
flames. For a moment, Michael's lunatic grin of triumph remains frozen in place,
licked by the purple radiance, not yet cognizant that the ritual has gone wrong.
In the next instant, however, he is stricken.

"The mirror..." he whispers hoarsely.

Bits of burning debris are raining down on the island. The cultists fall back in
panic and start pushing at each other to get off the island and escape. Many are
pushed off into the water, where clusters of ropy, jellyfish-like tentacles
immediately drag them screaming beneath the waves. A burning chunk of masonry
strikes one of your guards in the head, and he drops to the mud next to you with
a mass of chewed-spaghetti pulp where his face used to be. The other guard takes
a quick, frightened look around, then bolts without a backward glance.

"Come back!" screams Michael. "Come back, cowards!" But no one heeds him. With a
strangled curse he turns and hurls the torch into the sea.

Your score has just gone up by five points.

>x handcuffs
They're ordinary, police-issue handcuffs. The cuffs are closed.

The horrible, fleshy ground shudders beneath you. Bubbles begin to boil up
around the island's edges.

"You -- " Michael snarls at you, his voice a barely intelligible choke. The
malice pouring out of his expression is almost more than you can bear to look
at. "If I had the time I'd gut you right here and now -- " suddenly the ground
lurches slightly, and Michael smiles. "But perhaps I won't need to." With a
mocking bow he strides past you and hops over to the shore. "I'm sorry I can't
stay around to watch you die," he calls over his shoulder, "but I have some
rather urgent business to attend to." The next moment he is gone, running down
the breakwater toward town.

>x cultists
You can't see any such thing.

>inv
You are wearing a pair of handcuffs, a hooded robe, your clothes and your
wedding ring; in addition, you have in your hands a keyring, on which are nine
keys (a cell key, a long steel key, a tarnished bronze key, a small steel key,
an old-fashioned brass key, a small copper key, an old-fashioned iron key, a key
to the house and a key to the cellar), an amulet and your trenchcoat.

The boiling is becoming more violent. You also notice that the tide seems to be
striking the island a bit higher than before, even though the waves themselves
aren't getting any taller.

The boy cries pitifully, his sobs going unheeded by the chanting cultists and
the raging storm.

>pick handcuffs with needle
(first taking the crusty needle)
The metal cuffs bite painfully into your wrists, but with a little bit of
excruciating contortion you manage to insert the end of the needle into the
keyhole. For what seems like endless minutes, you jiggle the needle fruitlessly
around, biting your lip against the cramps that keep trying to seize your
painfully bent hands and bitterly reflecting that Linda Hamilton makes it look
deceptively easy on the big screen -- and suddenly the cuff snaps open. Quickly
you free your other wrist, and the handcuffs slide free, landing in the muck.

The island is definitely sinking now.

>free boy
Quickly you untie the bonds holding the boy to the stake; as his hands slip free
he jumps away from you and eyes you warily. Then, sniffling and rubbing his
arms, he runs to the edge of the island, hops over onto the breakwater and
starts sprinting home.

Not much time left; the water is lapping up almost to the island's center, and
the gap between the island and the rocky spur is nearly too wide to jump across.

Your score has just gone up by five points.

>w
You hop across the water-filled gap.

Rocky Spur
A small outcropping of stone, just large enough for you to stand on, sticks out
from the end of the breakwater. The hungry sea laps at your feet, surging over
the rocks and then trickling down into crevices. To the southwest, an uneven
trail leads back up the rocks, around the side of the lighthouse.

The sea thrashes against the shore with storm-driven fury.

Beyond the breakwater's tip, a small island has risen from the sea. It is
quickly sinking back into the churning waters.

With a final, shivering heave, the island of flesh sinks beneath the waves.
Soon, nothing is left except the bubbling, turbulent patch of water.

>save
Ok.

>sw
The trail turns northwest, following the curve of the lighthouse wall.

At the Foot of the Lighthouse
You stand in a circular clearing among the stones, surrounded on nearly every
side by the sea. Before you looms the ancient, massive lighthouse, a vertiginous
pillar of pale brick jabbing defiantly up at the sky. The road from the
southwest ends here, although it looks as though you could pick your way down
the rocks to the southeast, around the structure's base.

The sea thrashes against the shore with storm-driven fury.

The great bronze door of the lighthouse stands slightly ajar, revealing a narrow
rectangle of blackness within.

Another wave crashes against the rocks, sending a cloud of spray into the air.

>sw

Breakwater
You are picking your way across the breakwater's bare, rocky spine, where the
road has diminished to little more than a pair of dusty ruts. A hundred yards to
the northeast, at the breakwater's far end, the lonely stone tower of
Anchorhead's lighthouse stands vigil against the ocean.

The sea thrashes against the shore with storm-driven fury.

>w

Mill Road
The road carries you across a desolate heath of gray, windswept grass. To the
south, the black, jagged outline of Anchorhead's steep roofs and sharp, leaning
gables cuts across the horizon. The road forks here to the west and east,
heading across the railroad tracks in one direction, out toward the seashore in
the other.

>w
As you cross the railroad tracks, the air becomes warmer, more dingy, and
slightly more difficult to breathe.

Entrance to the Paper Mill
The road turns southwest here and runs squarely through the front entrance to
the old paper mill. A gate of heavy iron bars blocks the only opening into this
charred fortress, although an overgrown path leads around the wall to the south.
To the north, a rutted lane threads its way past a row of dilapidated shacks.

>n

Shanty Town
The road peters out at a wide clearing of rutted mud, flanked by uneven rows of
decrepit, clapboard shacks. The town is quiet, almost deserted; only a few bits
of loose tarpaper blowing listlessly in the wind betray the overall stillness.

The young boy you freed from the island is standing here. He gives you a fearful
glance.

Flakes of ash drift gently down from the sky like gray snow, coating everything
with a thin layer of soot, which is quickly washed away by the rain.

>wait
Time passes.

Silently, the boy walks through the churning mud to the front steps of #11 Mill
Town Road. For a moment, he stands there on the stoop, looking back at you;
dirty, disheveled, drenched by the streaming rain. Then he turns and, raising
his little fist, knocks on the door.

The door opens. The old woman looks out, then looks down. She sees the boy, and
it seems that she becomes just a little bit younger at that moment. "My baby..."
you hear her say, and then she is on her knees, folding her son into her arms.
She stands, still holding him, and looks over his shoulder at you.

"Thank you," she says. Her eyes speak volumes of gratitude that her words will
never be able to express. "Thank you for bringing him home."

And then she goes inside, and the door slowly closes behind her.

As you cross the railroad tracks, the air seems to lift slightly, becoming more
breathable once again.

Mill Road
The road carries you across a desolate heath of gray, windswept grass. To the
south, the black, jagged outline of Anchorhead's steep roofs and sharp, leaning
gables cuts across the horizon. The road forks here to the west and east,
heading across the railroad tracks in one direction, out toward the seashore in
the other.

A flurry of dead leaves goes skittering along the ground, swirling past you in
the wind.

>s

Junction
To the north, a gap in the crowded press of gloomy buildings opens onto a
country lane, heading out over a grassy heath. The main street continues to the
east, while to the northwest, over the top of a steep rise, you can just make
out the vaulted rooftops of the university.

>e

Narrow Street
As the lane winds along from east to west, it narrows until the steep, jagged
rooftops on either side of the street practically touch each other. To the
south, a side street leads across Whateley Bridge toward the center of town, and
a twisting lane leads up a hill to the northwest. A short flight of steps to the
north leads down to the local watering hole.

The rain slackens off momentarily to a weak drizzle, then returns afresh in a
brief, freezing downpour.

>s

Whateley Bridge
A hoary monument of crumbling, moss-eaten flagstones, Whateley Bridge is
possibly older than any other structure in the entire city. Ponderously it spans
the dark, torpid waters of the Miskaton River, connecting the north and south
halves of the city and occasionally raining bits of gravel and mortar from its
underside into the water. It looks just wide enough for two cars to pass each
other between the flanking stone parapets, but you wouldn't volunteer to try it.

You can see a meat hook here.

>get hook
Your hands are full.

The cold wind blows harder, tugging at your clothes.

>s

Town Square
A wide expanse of uneven pavestones lies open to the sky, bordered on all sides
by the leaning, steep-roofed architecture that looms over everything in this
city. The municipal courthouse stands at the south end of the square, next to
the mouth of a dark, narrow alley to the southwest. Avenues to the west and east
lead back into the cramped and ingrown streets, while to the north lies Whateley
Bridge.

Michael -- or rather, the thing that has possessed Michael's body -- is standing
here.

The poor old man's mutilated corpse hangs from the top of the obelisk.

Michael looks at you and smiles. It is not a particularly pleasant smile. He
walks over to the obelisk and places his hand against the bloodstained stone,
then mutters something guttural under his breath. The twisted hieroglyphs begin
to shine with an eerie phosphorescence which quickly brightens and envelopes
Michael. His form wavers, then becomes transparent, and when the light fades he
has disappeared.

The obelisk is still glowing.

>save
Ok.

>x corpse
The poor man's torn and broken body has been savaged nearly beyond recognition.
You can hardly bear to look at him.

The clouds overhead mutter restlessly to themselves.

The obelisk is still glowing.

>touch obelisk
As your fingers touch the gore-streaked stone, the green light grows brighter,
fanning out to envelope you. The odor of rotting fruit briefly assails your
nostrils; your vision streaks, then blurs; there is the sound of rushing air,
and when your eyes clear, you are somewhere else...

Burial Mound
The cave is lined, floor to ceiling, with mummified human corpses. Shrunken and
desiccated, they lie in jumbled heaps inside irregularly carved niches. Carvings
cover the rock walls in between the niches -- grotesque, leering faces too
horrible even to look upon, their features twitching and smirking in the
wavering light that sifts down from above.

Michael -- or rather, the thing that has possessed Michael's body -- is standing
here.

The obelisk base stands before you, vast and shadowy in the green, murky light.

At the narrower, northern end of the vaguely egg-shaped cavern sits a massive
stone altar, flanked on either side by a pair of strange, vibrating columns.

Suddenly Michael lunges forward and grabs your arms. He shakes you, causing your
head to whip back and forth and your teeth to click painfully together.

"Bitch -- " he hisses, " -- rotten, filthy bitch -- you never give up, do you?
You've foiled me for the last time! There's no way to fix what you've undone
tonight, but by all the unholy spawn of darkness I will put you in a stone cold
place for it!!" And his hands lock tightly around your throat and begin to
squeeze.

>show ring to michael
There is one chance -- if you can only somehow reach whatever weak flicker of
humanity still survives within that shell; if the person who was your husband
still exists somewhere, buried beneath the part that is Croseus Verlac...

Silently, you raise up your left hand, your wedding ring gleaming softly in the
strange, green light.

Michael is transfixed. He seems to want to recoil from the sight, yet is somehow
simultaneously drawn to it. Suddenly, his face crumbles, the madness and stoic
evil falling away to reveal confusion, fear, vulnerability and anguish -- all
superimposed upon the malevolent features of Croseus, struggling to regain
control.

Your score has just gone up by five points.

>show amulet to michael
In his moment of hesitation, you see your chance; straining against his choking
grip, you slip the amulet's cord around Michael's neck, letting the silver
pendant drop to his chest.

Instantly Michael begins convulsing, arching his back and clawing at his chest.
His jaws stretch open as if to release a howl of torment, but instead of voice,
a thick, ropy stream of ectoplasmic mist pours from his throat. It pools into
the center of the room, roils about, then coalesces into a human form -- the
vaporous, half-rotted apparition of Croseus Verlac himself!

Your score has just gone up by five points.

>get flute
(the strange metal flute)
Taken.

Michael lets out a weak groan.

>cover hole 1
You place your finger over the first flute hole.

The ghost lets out a chilling, sepulchral laugh. "You useless, puny mortal," it
cries. "Did you really think that there was any way on earth you could stop me?
I have lived and thrived for over four hundred years -- not even Death can claim
me!"

>cover hole 7
You place your finger over the seventh flute hole.

"You sabotaged my dimensional beacon -- I will build another. You drove me from
my host body -- I will find another. What next? Will you track down my
disciples, one by one, and kill them all? Will you set this whole town to the
torch?"

Michael is doubled over with racking coughs, bringing up a thin trickle of
blood.

>play flute
(the strange metal flute)
The flute emits an odd mixture of metallic, warbling notes which intertwine and
harmonize eerily with each other.

The strange harmony of the flute blends with the atonal ringing of the two
columns, and the three sounds suddenly grow stronger, resonating with and
reinforcing one another, intertwining like a dissonant, invisible braid. The
sound increases in volume, piercing your eardrums and causing the very air to
shimmer.

Suddenly the air above the altar begins to ripple as though with extreme heat.
The very fabric of space seems to twist and buckle between the two columns; and
then, with a sound like a wet sheet being torn slowly down the middle, the
fabric splits.

You are immediately swept off your feet by a powerful sucking vacuum, pulling
everything within reach toward the portal. Dust and debris; bones and loose rock
from the burial niches; everything not nailed down goes flying across the temple
and into the all-devouring maw hovering over the altar-stone. Desperately, you
wedge your fingers into a crack in the floor; with the other hand you grasp hold
of Michael's pants leg and hang on for dear life.

Verlac is caught like a gossamer thread in a tornado. Frantically he claws at
the air, but as an insubstantial ghost there is nothing for him to hang on to.
Shrieking and cursing, he is dragged inexorably back, closer and closer to the
portal, until the suction draws his corpus out into a long, trailing ribbon,
like an unraveling cable-knit sweater -- and in the next moment he is gone
forever, sucked into whatever alien dimension lies beyond that horrible rift.

For a few agonizing moments you don't think you're going to make it; then,
suddenly, the chaos stops, leaving you breathless on the floor.

Painstakingly, you pry your stiff, bleeding fingers out of the crack and roll
over. The rift is gone. The air is normal, and the columns are ringing quietly,
as if nothing had happened.

Silence reigns.

There passes some time that your memory cannot account for; a brief period of
blackness and oblivion, you and your unconscious husband, together in the
subterranean vault. Perhaps you were unconscious as well; you cannot remember.
At some point you become conscious again. You lift Michael to his feet, putting
his arm around your shoulders, and the two of you stagger up the titan stairs to
the surface. The ground begins rumbling just as you are exiting the house, but
by that time Michael has recovered some of his senses and can walk a bit faster.

You make it down to the bend in the road overlooking the town just in time to
see the town square collapse, the vile obelisk sinking into the earth. Several
buildings are dragged down along with it. A gas pipe ruptures in the courthouse,
sending a gout of flame high into the air, and soon the entire town is burning.

Behind you, a muffled explosion and a sudden warmth against your back bespeak a
similar end to the Verlac family mansion. For a moment you find yourself almost
turning back, driven by instinct to rescue your belongings -- but you stop. You
turn away. And while Michael rests, you stand at the overlook and watch the
sparks rise like fireflies, mingling with the stars in a clear, cloudless sky.

Home
You are home, and it is a momentous event. Downstairs, Michael is waiting for
you to bring him the wondrous news. To the east is the bedroom you both share,
and to the north is your bathroom.

A cool wave of uneasiness washes slowly over you; you're not sure why.

Your score has just gone up by fifteen points.

>e
There's nothing important in the bedroom at the moment.

"Well?" Michael calls excitedly from downstairs. "Have you looked yet?"

>d
You don't want to go downstairs until you have something to tell Michael.

Michael calls up again, this time sounding slightly worried: "Hon? Everything
okay up there?"

>tell michael okay
You can't see any such thing.

>say I'm okay
(to yourself)
Talking to yourself is a sure sign of impending mental collapse.

A nameless, formless apprehension grips you suddenly, leaving you short of
breath. Why are you so frightened, on what should be such a joyous occasion?

You can hear a fly buzzing around, hovering over the back of your neck.

>x fly
You can't see where the fly is. You're not even sure where the buzzing is coming
from.

You can barely feel yourself walking; it's almost as if some outer force were
moving you of its own accord.

Your bathroom; an ordinary place. A normal, safe, familiar place.

On the counter is a home pregnancy test.

>x counter
It's just an ordinary-looking counter.

>get test
You pick up the home pregnancy test. It's an ordinary pregnancy test, the kind
you can get at any drugstore; the kind with the little window that turns pink if
you're going to have a baby.

>x test
It's an ordinary pregnancy test, the kind you can get at any drugstore; the kind
with the little window that turns pink if you're going to have a baby.

>look in little window
You find nothing of interest.

>look at little window
You stare down at the little plastic indicator, and an inexplicable horror
seizes you as you recall Edward Verlac's last words:

And besides; who could say whether the crafty devil Croseus might not concoct
some new way to enter the world, through a new body -- through that of one of my
daughters, perhaps? The ritual has always demanded a grandson, but Croseus was
never one to let such a trivial inconvenience stop him. He would find a way. He
always returns to his blood.

The window is pink. The test is positive.

From downstairs, you can hear Michael joyfully talking to himself:

"Oh, I hope it's a little girl," he says. "I've always wanted to have a little
girl."

Of course, you have already surmised that there are many creative ways in which
you can die in this game. Whether or not you find that particularly amusing...
well, that's between you and your conscience. I, for one, found them amusing to
code; perhaps you will find them amusing to experience.

Do not attempt the following at home:

   - standing on the train tracks until the train comes. 
   - standing on the altar while you blow the flute. 
   - wandering around the Narrow Aisles adjacent to the Mill Floor for too long.

   - not giving Michael the mirror when he asks for it. 
   - letting Michael die before you destroy Croseus. 
   - reading the big black book in the abandoned church -- in its entirety. 
   - EXAMINING William Verlac. 
   - ATTACKING Michael with the meat hook. 
   - allowing the summoning ritual to proceed to its conclusion without
sabotaging the beacon first.

Did you try just typing LISTEN while Michael is in the shower on the morning of
Day 2? Type it several times.

Did you take a good look at the paintings in the gallery? One scene in
particular will catch your eye. EXAMINE the scene. Leave the room and come back
later, and EXAMINE the paintings again.

In Claudia Benson's last letter, she mentions that she did some research at the
Miskatonic library. Did you try looking her name up on the circulation register?
You might find some interesting reading material.

You may have noticed that your appearance changes as the game progresses and you
get more and more filthy. Did you try EXAMINING yourself while wearing the
strait jacket? How about talking to yourself?

Also, did you EXAMINE yourself during the epilogue?

Did you try SCREAMING or CRYING? Did you try it while handcuffed to the island
at the end of Chapter Four?

If you wait around for a while at the Twisting Lane or the Rocky Spur, you might
catch something interesting. You might have to wait a long time, though.

Did you try typing XYZZY? No? Good.

Several puzzles in Anchorhead admit more than one solution; some even boast more
than two. Many of these alternate solutions are actually "second chances" that
pop up elsewhere in the story, should you happen to miss the narrow window of
oppourtunity provided to solve the puzzle the first time. Although my caveat
about saving in "About This Game" still holds, there are actually few mistakes
in Anchorhead that are truly irreversible (other than the immediately fatal
ones, of course).

You might find it interesting to go back and see if you can find other ways to:

   - discover the name "Verlac". 
   - clear away the spiderweb in the cellar. 
   - get the brass key from the attic cell. 
   - obtain Michael's faculty card. 
   - open the puzzle box. 
   - reach the bottom riser from the church basement. 
   - spy on Michael on the morning of the third day. 
   - turn the steam-release wheel. 
   - get up to the mill catwalk. 
   - open the real estate agent's desk drawer. 
   - safely witness the old bum's murder. 
   - get rid of the madman in Danvers Asylum.

2nd PRIZE:

"Obscure fact: Edward writes that he pricked the inside of his cheek to draw
blood for his ink. The inside of the cheek isn't a good choice for an inkwell,
since it's mighty difficult to get it to bleed. Have you bitten your cheek while
chewing food? It hurts, but it doesn't bleed. Have you seen body manipulators
pierce their cheeks with a metal skewer? They choose the cheek precisely because
it won't bleed. You can try this at home yourself with a needle or a large
safety pin. Sterilize it, psyche yourself up, and pierce the cheek from the
inside to the outside. It's *very* disconcerting, but it's not painful, and if
there's any blood at all, it will bleed from the *outside* of the cheek, not the
inside."

1st PRIZE:

A high counter divides the public portion of the library from the reserved
stacks -- all the more esoteric and mysterious volumes from the university's
collection. If anything, the area behind the counter is even more shadowy than
the side you're on. The main reading area lies south.

Hanging on the wall next to the counter is a small, printed sign. Beneath the
sign sits a heavy, dog-eared register, and sitting next to the register is a
bell.

>look up benson
(in the dog-eared register)
Claudia Benson's name is up near the top of the page. She has checked out
several books in the last few weeks: A Historical Overview of Superstitions in
the Miskaton Valley Region by J. Arnsworth Frazer; The Righteous Invasion: a
History of Indian/Settler Conflicts in the Colonial Period by Warner Greene;
Mechanics of Metempsychosis by C. C. H. Horne; and N-Fold Transduction and the
Space-Time Barrier: a New Theory in Particle Physics by Lord Wheldrake. Strange;
you can't help but wonder why your real estate agent would have amassed such an
esoteric reading list.

>read greene
Its full title is The Righteous Invasion: a History of Indian/Settler Conflicts
in the Colonial Period by Warner Greene. It's a slim volume, published by
Miskaton Press in 1943. According to the introduction, the book's purpose is to
give an objective account of the social and economic factors which led some of
the early American colonies into violent conflict with the tribes of the
northeast, concluding with a transitional discussion of how the "Indian
policies" which took shape early on evolved into Western Expansionism and the
idea of Manifest Destiny. The author, reflecting the more conservative decade in
which he wrote, tends to paint a more sympathetic picture of the European side
of the issue than would be fashionable today; but all in all it seems an
intelligent, thoughtful analysis.

Glancing through the table of contents, you notice that there is a short chapter
on the Misquat Indians. Curious, you flip to the page.

The fate of the Misquat tribe, states the author, is an enigma which may never
be solved. Diplomatic relationships with the original river valley settlers
seemed doomed from the beginning. Documents from the period paint the tribe as
aggressively pagan, degenerate savages. Nevertheless, Croseus Verlac managed to
hammer out a peace treaty of sorts with the tribal leader, and the two groups
led an uneasy coexistence for over a century.

The exact circumstances which led up to the "battle" of Quattac Bend in 1772 are
unclear. One document makes mention of an "uprising", although since as far as
is known, the Misquats were never in a subservient relationship to the
Anchorhead settlers, the use of this term is more puzzling than revealing. In
fact, no evidence has yet been discovered that corroborates the notion that the
Misquat Indians initiated any sort of hostility whatsoever.

What is known is this: the Battle of Quattac Bend took place in the dead of
night. It was led by Croseus' descendant, Heinrich Verlac, and "fought" by some
twenty town men, who crept through the woods and ambushed the small tribe during
one of its holy ceremonies. There are no lists of casualties. Although the diary
of one soldier tells of many prisoners being taken, there is no mention of where
these prisoners were kept or what was eventually done to them.

No known document makes even the vaguest allusion to the Misquat Indians after
1772. From that date onward, the tribe effectively ceases to exist.

According to the author's foreword, the term "metempsychosis" means the
transmigration of souls -- that is, the reincarnation of a soul into another
body. The book, which was published in 1922, is an examination of various
traditions' explanations of how and why this happens. The author's tone is very
matter-of-fact; it's unclear whether he is approaching the subject from the
standpoint of a mythologist or if he actually believes in reincarnation and is
evaluating the various theories based on their "scientific" validity.

Flipping through the book, you find a passage that has been highlighted:

"Among tribes with a strong ancestor-worship tradition, one often discovers the
quaint notion that one may be reincarnated as one's own descendant. Asking such
people whether they must share a single body with the spirit of their ancestor
(inheritance), or if they themselves are in essence their own grandfather
(identity), is generally futile; among primitives, concepts of self-identity are
poorly defined at best. Often there exists no word in their native language to
express the idea. One can assume, however, that the primitive tribesman's
conception of the situation is probably closer to the latter option; otherwise,
over the course of generations one would have to contend with dozens of
ancestral spirits fighting for room within a single body. However, the theory of
identity also begs the question: how far back does the chain of reincarnation
go? One could conceivably be dealing with a tribe of 'first' men, present at the
day of Creation and renewing themselves over the aeons with each succeeding
generation."

(in the dog-eared register)
Claudia Benson's name is up near the top of the page. She has checked out
several books in the last few weeks: A Historical Overview of Superstitions in
the Miskaton Valley Region by J. Arnsworth Frazer; The Righteous Invasion: a
History of Indian/Settler Conflicts in the Colonial Period by Warner Greene;
Mechanics of Metempsychosis by C. C. H. Horne; and N-Fold Transduction and the
Space-Time Barrier: a New Theory in Particle Physics by Lord Wheldrake. Strange;
you can't help but wonder why your real estate agent would have amassed such an
esoteric reading list.

Wordlessly the librarian retreats back into the shadows, only to reappear the
next moment carrying the book you requested. Dutifully, you sign the register,
and the librarian hands you the book before disappearing again.

>read wheldrake
This is a very thin volume, more of a tract than a proper book. You notice with
some interest that it was published in 1918 by Miskaton University Press, though
who "Lord Wheldrake" was you cannot begin to fathom.

Even without a background in physics, you can immediately tell that this is
nothing but the purest pseudoscience. The author claims to have made "startling
advances" relating to a heretofore unknown medium through which energy can
travel. As far as you can tell, he performed no actual experiments; his entire
thesis is built on extrapolation from his own creative reasoning. One bit near
the middle has been marked with a highlighter:

"Having established the existence of the N-space medium, we can then reasonably
posit the existence of a special wave-length capable of traveling through that
medium; we will call this form of energy, appropriately enough, N-rays. Due to
the fundamentally extradimensional nature of N-space, N-rays cannot logically be
located at any one point of the electromagentic spectrum; they instead exist at
every point along the spectrum, traveling perpendicular it. Naturally, the
practical ramifications of being able to transmit extradimensionally are dwarfed
by the theoretical implications..."

Good grief, you can't help thinking. What drivel.
